I think it is the UK's single most important relationship. There is a deep bond between Britain and the US, built on many pillars.  \n\"We have a fantastic cross-government team across the US and I look forward to working with them to strengthen and even further deepen the special relationship between our two countries and peoples.\"\nMr Raab added: \"I am delighted that Karen Pierce will take forward this exciting new chapter in our relationship. \n\"We're proud to be sending to Washington such an outstanding diplomat, and I warmly congratulate her on her appointment.\"\nDame Karen Pierce is widely regarded in the diplomatic world to be a good egg. \nShe is a Foreign Office lifer who has served all over the world. Blunt and no-nonsense, maybe, but also wily in the ways of Washington. \nShe has held several posts both there and at the United Nations in New York, and she has the confidence of the prime minister who got on well with her when he was foreign secretary. \nSo, Dame Karen is hugely qualified for the job, but will need every bit of her charm and guile in the months ahead. \nUK/US relations are at a low ebb after disagreements about Iran, Huawei and digital taxes, along with the diplomatic row over the death of Harry Dunn. \nHer biggest challenge, of course, will be to help secure a trade deal between the US and post-Brexit Britain. And that will be no easy task. \nThe UK has not had an ambassador in the US since Sir Kim resigned in July after the emails - dating from 2017 - were leaked. \nIn his resignation letter, Sir Kim said the situation made it \"impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like\".\nPresident Trump branded him \"a very stupid guy\" and said he would no longer work with the diplomat. \nThe row erupted in the middle of the Tory leadership contest, with the now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson heavily criticised for not fully supporting Sir Kim.  \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51409739": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51409739", "title": "Windrush: Call to review deportation of foreign-born offenders", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:00:47 GMT", "summary": "The findings come in a leaked draft of the Windrush Lessons Learned review, seen by BBC Newsnight.", "story": "The government should consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children, according to a draft report into the Windrush scandal.\nAhead of a deportation flight to Jamaica next week, a leaked copy of the Windrush report calls on the government to consider an overhaul of the law.\nThe findings come in a draft of the Windrush Lessons Learned review, leaked to the Labour MP David Lammy and seen exclusively by Newsnight.\nSajid Javid commissioned the review in July 2018, while home secretary, to avoid any future repeat of the Windrush scandal.\nThe Windrush scandal revealed that citizens of Commonwealth countries - who had an automatic right to settle in the UK until 1973 - had wrongly faced questions about those rights. \nSome were denied entry to the UK when they sought to return home after visiting their country of birth, whilst others were wrongly denied access to public services and benefits.\nOne of the aims of the Windrush review, written by Wendy Williams - an inspector of constabulary, is to rebuild confidence among members of the Windrush generation and their relatives. \nAccording to the draft of the report, that process would be helped by ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who have mainly been raised in the UK.\nThe draft of the report, written in June last year, says: \"Government should review its policy and approach to FNOs [foreign national offenders], if necessary through primary legislation.

but it is yet to appear. \nHe said on Wednesday that it would be disclosed after the committee, which was disbanded at December's election, is up and running again. \nBut former chair of the committee, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC the reasons for its non-publication are \"entirely bogus\". \nIt was set up in 1994 in order to allow Parliamentarians to scrutinise the work of the UK's security services.\nThe nine-member committee is made up of MPs and peers from different parties - ministers are not allowed to be members.\nUnder the Justice and Security Act 2013, they are allowed to examine the \"expenditure, administration, policy and operations\" of MI6, MI5, GCHQ, and the government.\nIn the last few years, the committee has published reports on issues including the terrorist attacks in 2017 and diversity in the intelligence industry.\nUnlike other committees in Parliament, the prime minister has power over who is a member - although the chair is chosen by members themselves. \nThe decision to start an inquiry into Russian interference in the UK was partly prompted by developments after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.\nThe committee's annual report mentioned the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible interference in the Brexit referendum.\nAfter the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March, the investigation became the \"primary focus\" of the committee in 2018.\nThe report was completed in March 2019, but then had to go through a process of redaction, where the government and security agencies make sure no confidential information is published.Mr Grieve told MPs that this process had finished and the report was sent to the prime minister on 17 October.\nUsually, once a report is signed off, it can be presented to Parliament - and therefore the public. \nDuring a BBC Question Time special in the run-up to the election, Mr Johnson said he saw \"no reason to interfere in the normal timetable for these things just because there's an election going on\". \nHe added that he had seen \"absolutely no evidence\" of interference in \"any British electoral event\". \nMinisters have also argued that it is not unusual for there to be a delay between sign-off and publication, which is why nothing was released before the general election in December.\nNow that a new Parliament has formed, the committee has to be set up from scratch. It is probably only once this has happened that the document can be released.\nWhen pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: \"The report will of course be published...when the Intelligence and Security Committee is reconstituted.\"\nHe went on to accuse SNP MP Owen Thompson, who said the lack of publication so far was unacceptable, of having a \"conspiratorial frame of mind\". \nBut the formation of the new committee is largely the responsibility of the government, which has to consult the leader of the Labour Party regarding its members.\nIt all comes down to how quickly a new committee can be formed. After the 2017 election, it took many months and there is no sign of progress at this stage.\nIt is unclear what - if anything - will come from the publication of the report itself. \nMr Grieve said the document had \"never been marketed by anybody as having smoking gun properties\", making the delay \"all the more mysterious\".\nHe added: \"I would be surprised if we were to see it before Easter\".\nAsked to comment, a UK government spokesperson declined to add anything beyond what Mr Johnson has previously told Parliament. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51413070": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51413070", "title": "Ministers pledge increase in children's cycle training", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 14:23:18 GMT", "summary": "The government is promising to make cycling proficiency lessons available to every child in England.", "story": "The government has pledged to make cycling proficiency lessons available to every child in England.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said an extra 400,000 training places per year would be delivered by a funding boost to the Bikeability programme. \nThe scheme offers more training on roads than the playground-based Cycling Proficiency Test it replaced in 2006.\nCycling UK said the government would not get millions more cycling without infrastructure investment.\nThe Bikeability scheme provides free or subsidised lessons through schools, councils and trainers. \nAccording to the Transport department, the timescale and cost for introducing the extra places has yet to be determined. \nHowever, ministers said spending on cycling and walking schemes had doubled since 2016, and was set to reach \u00a32.4bn. \nAnnouncing the commitment, Cycling Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said ministers wanted to inspire the \"next generation\" of cyclists. \nHe added that a boost in cycling would improve children's mental and physical health, and help the UK meet emissions reduction targets. \nExtending cycle proficiency training to every child was a commitment made by the Conservatives in their manifesto for December's general election. \nLabour also pledged to increase funding available to boost cycling, while the Lib Dems said a tenth of transport spending should go towards cycling and walking. \nCycling UK welcomed the announcement, but said encouraging significant numbers of new cyclists would require major investment.\nThe charity's chief executive Paul Tuohy said: \"We won't get millions more cycling unless there's further significant investment in infrastructure.\n\"Without it, the government is on a highway to failure in getting more people active.\"\nHe added \u00a36-8bn would need to be spent on cycling and walking projects over the next five years if the government's uptake targets are to be met. \nLessons through the Bikeability scheme are available to children in England as soon as they can ride a bicycle without stabilisers. \nSimilar schemes also exist in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

despite having the right to live in the UK for decades. \nThe fallout prompted criticism of the government's \"hostile environment\" approach to immigration and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd as

specifically for removing foreign criminals. \n\"Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing Class-A drugs.\"\nThe spokeswoman added that \"everyone on the flight will have had their cases fully reviewed to ensure there are no outstanding legal barriers, including trafficking and slavery claims, that would prevent their removal from the

It could instead mean it would become a civil offence similar to non-payment of council tax or an electricity bill. \nIn a speech on Wednesday, Baroness Morgan said many people thought it wrong that \"you can be imprisoned for not paying the TV licence and its enforcement punishes the vulnerable\".  \n\"We are launching a public consultation to make sure we have a fair and proportionate approach to licence fee penalties and payments, that protects those most in need in society,\" she added.\nThe culture secretary also announced a new flexible payment scheme, called the Simple Payment Plan, to help those struggling to pay, including the over-75s.\nIt will allow people to spread the fee out into a number of manageable instalments. \n\"This will help prepare the BBC and public service broadcasting for the future and make sure it continues to work for our society, our economy, and the public which funds it,\" said Baroness Morgan. \nLast year, Treasury minister Rishi Sunak said the Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ordered a review of the sanction for non-payment of the \u00a3154.50 charge, which funds the BBC.\nConfirmation of the consultation comes two days after it was announced \nIt also the fee is to increase by \u00a33, from \u00a3154.50 to \u00a3157.50, from 1 April 2020., a decision which saw a number of celebrities joining the call for the decision to be overturned. \nFrom June, only over-75s who are claiming pension credit will be eligible for a free TV licence.\nFormer BBC chairman Lord Grade's urged the government not to \"impoverish and weaken\" the corporation, which he described as the \"corner stone\" of the creative industries in the UK. \nHe said the BBC had \"huge success in promoting the brand of Great Britain around the world\", adding that any plan to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee \"feels like another attempt to impoverish the BBC and weaken it\" and should be \"abandoned immediately\".\nBaroness Morgan said her plans should not be seen as \"any kind of attack on the BBC\".\nThe broadcaster is an \"incredibly important organisation in the UK and around the world\", she said, but added it was the government's \"duty\" to look into the issue of funding.\nIn a statement, the BBC said \"a detailed government-commissioned review (in 2015) found the current system to be the fairest and most effective\". \n\"It did not recommend change - in part because the current system is effective in ensuring payment with very few people ever going to prison. \n\"If there are changes, they must be fair to law abiding licence fee payers and delivered in a way that doesn't fundamentally undermine the BBC's ability to deliver the services they love.\"\nIn 2018, more than 121,000 people were convicted and sentenced for evasion and issued with an average fine of \u00a3176.\nThere were around 26 million TV licences being used in the UK last year, generating \u00a33.69bn in income for the BBC.\nIf decriminalisation of the TV licence fee were to go through, it would have a considerable impact on BBC funding. \nThe DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) said the government would take into account the impact on the corporation in the context of the overall licence fee settlement, for which negotiations begin later this year. \nA previous government review in 2015 looked into whether a fine for non-payment could be issued under civil law instead, similar to the fees for breaking parking, bus lane and congestion charge rules.\nThe review also examined whether unpaid TV licence fees should be considered a civil debt in the same way as unpaid utility bills or council tax.\nHowever, it recommended against changing the criminal sanctions regime, saying decriminalisation could bring with it an increased risk of evasion. \nA consultation is a process used by public bodies that invites the public to provide their views and feedback on a particular proposal.\nThe members of the public who are asked are individuals and organisations that would be affected directly or indirectly by a project or a decision. \nThey include those who have the ability to influence the decision, both positively and negatively.

a net gain of 320.\nOpening the debate, Tory MP Mike Wood said the pub and beer industries were \"the greatest success stories of the past 20 years\" in UK business, with almost 900,000 jobs depending on them. \nBut he criticised the system of business rates, saying it was a \"basic fairness issue\" when pubs were responsible for 2.8% of all rate revenues collected -

a pint in Germany, a pint in the Netherlands, one in Spain, one in Belgium and one in Poland - you would still have paid less duty on those fives pints than you would have on just a single pint bought in Britain.\"\nOther MPs joined in with stories of pubs and breweries in their constituencies, raising the concerns they have.\nLabour MP Lilian Greenwood praised The Plough in Radford -

We need to keep pushing to get it through Parliament.\"\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb said: \"School uniforms should always be affordable and should not leave pupils or their families feeling that they cannot apply to a particular school.\n\"That is why we will be supporting the progress of this bill through Parliament, in order to make our guidance on the cost considerations for school uniform statutory at the earliest opportunity.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson tweeted that he was \"delighted\" the government would support the bill, adding: \"Uniforms should always be affordable and should never put families off applying to a particular school.\"\nLast year, a Children's Society survey of 1,000 parents saw nearly one in six families blame uniform costs for having to cut back on food and other basic essentials. \nA joint inquiry by Parliament's education and work and pensions committees last September also heard evidence that schools could cuts costs for parents by choosing to have non-branded uniforms. \nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, low-income families can claim support towards the cost of school uniforms.

He said he would be raising the matter with party officials. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51417851": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51417851", "title": "Resole: Giving trainers to homeless and disadvantaged teenagers", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 19:28:45 GMT", "summary": "A social enterprise is giving out trainers to homeless and disadvantaged teenagers.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51399218": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51399218", "title": "Labour MP Carolyn Harris' emotional speech on stillbirths", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:17:58 GMT", "summary": "Labour MP Carolyn Harris has told MPs she suspects her mother never knew where her sister was buried.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51413370": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51413370", "title": "Question Time: Was Tracy Brabin's dress appropriate for parliament?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 10:30:52 GMT", "summary": "Following criticism of an MP's choice of clothing, the panel was asked if an audience member was dressed appropriately for Question Time.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51406207": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51406207", "title": "\u2018As a woman in politics, whatever you wear you can't win\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:54:48 GMT", "summary": "Labour MP Alison McGovern tells 5 Live how people use clothes 'to have a go at you'.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51393478": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51393478", "title": "Republic of Ireland vote 2020: Runners and riders", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:08:26 GMT", "summary": "BBC Ireland Correspondent Chris Page assesses the prospects for Saturday's election.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389210": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389210", "title": "Labour 'more credible' under my leadership - Thornberry", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:59:32 GMT", "summary": "Labour leadership contender Emily Thornberry has said the party would be \"more credible\" under her.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389207": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389207", "title": "In full: Emily Thornberry interview with Laura Kuenssberg", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 16:59:35 GMT", "summary": "Laura Kuenssberg sits down with Labour leadership contender Emily Thornberry.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51371760": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51371760", "title": "Is the government avoiding the media and does it even matter?", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:55:49 GMT", "summary": "Journalists say the government is not being open and accountable, something the Prime Minister's team denies.", "story": "The media and the government have always had a frosty - or far too cosy - relationship depending on who you want to believe. \nHowever, have things taken a turn for the worst?\nThis week, there was a mass walkout by political journalists after senior reporters say they weren't allowed into a meeting at Number 10.This is denied by those working for the Prime Minister.\nThey argue this is the most open and transparent government in decades.\nThe government is being accused of avoiding tough questions and selecting who it gives background information to. \nA minister told Parliament: \"We reserve the right to brief journalists which we choose whenever we wish to, and that is not something abnormal.\"\nThat's what some critics think. \nThe government hasn't been interviewed on some national BBC news programmes after major news events, like the recent terror attack in London.\nWe asked a minister to appear on @BBCr4today today to explain what they planned to do to stop released terrorists attacking people on the streets.

They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. \nBut that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. \nTerms and conditions always apply and the EU says it has two main conditions.\nFirst and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. \nThese are known as level-playing-field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.  \nMost importantly, its draft negotiating mandate says a future partnership must \"ensure the application\" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. \nThe UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights. \nBut Boris Johnson has publicly ruled out any such commitment and said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. \n\"There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,\" Mr Johnson said in his speech in London.\nHe also pointed out the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.  \nThe EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada. \nThe UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference. But if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. \nEither way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January. \nHis critics accuse him of recklessness but the prime minister says he has \"no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper\".\nThe EU's second condition is a free-trade deal must include an agreement on fisheries - because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. \nThe UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\". \nThe EU sees things rather differently.\nIts draft mandate says a future deal should \"aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters\".\nThat's a lot of access and the EU seems prepared to link it to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.  \nFishing is a tiny part of the UK economy - well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.  \nWhen it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is more flexible. \n\"We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,\" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. \n\"What I am looking for is consistency.\"\nThe UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. \nThe more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. \nThat's true for both goods and services. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. \nInstead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. \nBut talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. \nIt doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.\nThis is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.   \nMr Johnson said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.  \nGaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. \nNow, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free trade agreement. \nIt wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they \"raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law\".\nBut the government's written statement says a future agreement cannot include \"any jurisdiction for the [ECJ] over the UK's laws\".\nThe ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.\nBut a future trade deal is a different matter. \nDevising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. \nIt's not just about trade, it's about internal security cooperation and access to databases too. \n\"Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,\" Michel Barnier said, \"obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full.\"\nThe EU's draft mandate also says there should be \"automatic termination\" of law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order \"must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way\". \nSo there are some big divides to be bridged. \nBoth sides say they would settle for a free-trade agreement but they have to work out how to get there and how to implement it.  \nIt is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. \nThere is a long way to go in a short period of time. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772", "title": "What is climate change?

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

Ceta does not do that.\nCeta gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs (that's taxes on imports) on goods traded between the EU and Canada. Tariffs remain on poultry, meat and eggs.\nIt also increases quotas (that's the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges) but does not get rid of them altogether. For example, quotas on EU cheese exports to Canada increase from 18,500 tonnes to 31,972 tonnes a year.\nIt does little for the trade in services and in particular almost nothing for the trade in financial services, which is very important for the UK economy.\nIt also does not remove border checks, so there is still a possibility that goods have to be examined at ports to make sure they meet regulatory requirements, and their paperwork is in order.\nCeta protects EU \"geographical indications\", meaning for example that you can only make Parma ham in Italy and camembert cheese in France, and Canada can't import something that calls itself camembert from any other country.\nThey have also agreed to open up government contracts to each other, so Canadian companies could bid to build French railways, for example.\nThere is also co-operation between the two countries on standards, so a piece of equipment made in an EU country can go through all its safety and quality checks there, without needing to have them repeated in Canada - and vice versa.\nCeta also allows professional qualifications to be recognised both in Canada and the EU, making it easier, for example, for architects or accountants to work in both places.\nAnd it aligns Canadian rules in some areas of copyright and patents with those of the EU.  \nCountries that are closer to each other tend to trade more, especially in goods, and this is the case with the UK and the EU.\nThe UK exported \u00a3291bn of goods and services to other EU countries in 2018, which was 45% of all UK exports.\nIt imported \u00a3357bn of goods and services from the EU, which was 53% of all UK imports.\nOn the other hand, Canada exported 46.2bn Canadian dollars (\u00a326.7bn) of goods and services to the EU in 2017, which was 7.9% of its exports.\nIt imported 63.6bn Canadian dollars of goods and services to the EU, which was 10.5% of its imports. \nThe prime minister also mentioned having an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's.\nThe EU does not have a free trade deal with Australia. They are in negotiations for one, but they currently operate mainly on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\nThere was an EU-Australia Partnership Framework agreed in 2008, which reduces barriers to trade, but was not a free trade agreement.\nSo, trading on a similar basis to Australia would be largely the same as trading under WTO rules. In other words, it's another way of saying the UK would leave with no trade deal in place. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987", "title": "Brexit: Five things the UK needs to resolve after leaving the EU", "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:01:52 GMT", "summary": "Why food, trade and security are some of the key challenges for post-Brexit Britain.", "story": "The UK might have left the EU but many questions remain unanswered. \nHere are just some of the hurdles facing the UK after Brexit.\nThis legal departure from the EU means the UK can finally start formal trade negotiations - both with the EU and countries around the world, like the US. \nThe government is determined not to extend the post-Brexit transition period - to discuss the future relationship with the EU - beyond the end of 2020. This means the timetable for getting an agreement with the EU is extremely tight. \nFormal talks are expected to begin in March, once the remaining 27 EU countries have agreed on instructions for their negotiators. \nGetting any agreement finally signed off and put into practice will take a couple of months towards the end of the year. So, realistically, that only leaves time for a fairly basic free trade deal to emerge, with plenty of issues still up for discussion once the transition period is over. accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs.% of total UK trade in 2018\nThe government talks about getting a \"zero tariff, zero quota\" deal on goods, with no border taxes and no limits on exports and imports. \nBut there are a host of issues to be dealt with if the aim is to keep trade flowing as smoothly as possible, and that is before we mention the services sector. \nFrom financial and business services to the food and drinks industry, this \nIt is of course in the interest of both sides to get a deal done, but it remains a massive task. Expect disputes about fisheries, fair competition, the role of the European Court of Justice and more.\nIt is possible that no deal will be done in time, which will generate a fresh crisis in UK/EU relations as 2020 draws to a close.    \nIf the challenge to get a trade deal within 11 months is not hard enough, the UK must also agree a treaty to paper over legal cracks in the way countries work together on security.\nPolicing and security experts in the UK and the EU agree that things will become harder after Brexit.\nFor instance, the UK no longer has a place on the team that manages Europol, the agency that co-ordinates major investigations into Europe-wide organised crime. \nThis means the UK's priorities - such as concerns about smuggling people or arms across the English Channel - may, slowly, fall down the pecking order. \nBritish police officers can, for now, still use EU systems to check criminal records of foreign nationals, or alerts on wanted people from around the continent. \nBut access to that information could either end or become harder, because many member states have their own specific laws governing data-sharing beyond the EU. \nThe government is trying to think ahead. \nIt has, for instance, pledged to pass laws to ensure the same fast service the UK has enjoyed from the European Arrest Warrant - which allows suspects to be sent to another country for trial - if a deal cannot be struck. Everyone, on both sides, wants that. \nThe question is whether it is legally doable - and if so, can it be done by January 2021?\nFrom farming and fishing to manufacturing and retail, the UK's food and drink sector adds \u00a3460bn to the UK economy every year, employing more than four million people. \nIt represents a fifth of UK manufacturing, by far the biggest chunk of the sector. \nSo there is some nervousness about what will happen to the complicated way that food and drink makes its way to consumers after the end of the transition period. \nA third of people in the industry are from outside the UK, with many from Eastern Europe. What happens if the number of such workers is restricted because of the introduction of a minimum salary being imposed for migrants? \nWhen it comes to trade, there is the prospect products may have to be opened and checked at borders which could add expense and cut the shelf life of fresh food. \nAnd the Food and Drink Federation, a body representing food manufacturers, says the most complex challenge is around trying to get a trade deal with Europe that satisfies what are called \"rules of origin\". \nUK manufacturers use a mixture of domestic and internationally-produced ingredients, which would not be allowed under rules included in recent EU trade deals.\nThe government has a huge task ahead to establish the UK's place in the world after leaving the EU. \nMinisters have to work out what the government's slogan \"Global Britain\" actually means. \nThe traditional role of providing a transatlantic bridge between Europe and the US will be put to one side. \nInstead, ministers must develop a more independent foreign policy. That could mean less automatic support from the UK for the US, as it focuses more on domestic issues and less on its relations with other countries.\nIt will mean a new relationship with European allies, not through EU structures, but through smaller existing groups. These include the E3, an informal group made up of the UK, Germany and France, which has worked together on issues like relations with Iran. \nThe biggest foreign policy challenge will be how to navigate a path between an increasingly stronger China and a defensive US, without the protective membership of the EU. \nTo that end, Boris Johnson has ordered what he calls an 'integrated review\" of the UK's security, defence and foreign policy which is expected to report later this year. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe protesters who turn up on Westminster's College Green are a lonely bunch these days. \nEven the most ardent fan of the EU would have to admit that the heat has gone out of the passionate, and often vicious, political fight of the last few years. \nThe challenge for Mr Johnson is now to show to the public that all the disruption, all the arguing, was actually worth it. \nThat will not be easy. Brexiteers are keen to make the most of the powers that will come back to the UK from Brussels as soon as possible. \nBut now we are in the departure lounge - the transition period where the status quo will stay pretty much the same. \nEven if you popped champagne on Friday night to celebrate the UK leaving the EU, when you woke up on Saturday morning not much would have actually felt very different. \nCan the enthusiasm and excitement on that side be managed?\nAnd even though the stay or leave debate is now at an end, some voters still believe we are setting off on a path of folly. And there are big fears that a trade deal No 10 wants simply is not doable by the end of the year.\nMr Johnson would be perfectly happy if after Friday, the B-word was never heard again, but he needs to show to the public on both sides it was worth it. \nHe has already found a place in the history books, but the chapter is not yet complete.  terms & conditions.\nUse this form to ask your question: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51337615": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51337615", "title": "Brexitcast: Over and Out!", "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2020 02:34:00 GMT", "summary": "The latest episode of Brexitcast marks the moment the UK formally left the EU.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887", "title": "Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:05:36 GMT", "summary": "A simple guide on the UK leaving the European Union.", "story": "The UK stopped being a member of the European Union (EU) after 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020. \nFor those not following every twist and turn, this is what you need to know.Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU.\nA public vote (known as a referendum) was held in June 2016, when 17.4 million people opted for Brexit. This gave the Leave side 52%, compared with 48% for Remain. \nThe EU is an economic and political union involving 28 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. \nThe UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and it will be the first member state to withdraw. \nAfter the UK formally leaves the EU on 31 January 2020, there is still a lot to talk about and months of negotiation will follow.\nWhile the UK has agreed the terms of its EU departure, both sides still need to decide what their future relationship will look like.This will be worked out during the transition period (which some prefer to call the implementation period), which begins immediately after Brexit day and is due to end on 31 December 2020.\nDuring this 11-month period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. \nThe transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while a new free trade agreement is negotiated. \nThis is needed because the UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of the transition. A free trade agreement will allow goods to move around the EU without checks or extra charges.\nIf a new one cannot be agreed in time, then the UK faces the prospect of having to trade with no deal in place. That would mean tariffs (taxes) on UK goods travelling to the EU and other trade barriers.\nAside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will also need to be decided. For example:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists the transition period will not be extended, but the European Commission has warned that the timetable will be extremely challenging.\nThe transition period and other aspects of the UK's departure were agreed in a separate deal called the withdrawal agreement.\nMost of that was negotiated by Theresa May's government. But after Mr Johnson replaced her in July 2019, he removed the most controversial part - the backstop. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe backstop was designed to ensure there would be no border posts or barriers between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. If needed, it would have kept the UK in a close trading relationship with the EU.\nUnder Mr Johnson's deal, a customs border will effectively be created between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be subject to checks and will have to pay EU import taxes (known as tariffs). \nThese would be refunded if goods remain in Northern Ireland (ie are not moved to the Republic of Ireland).Supporters of the new customs arrangement say it will allow the UK to negotiate its own trade deals with other countries - something that would not have been possible under the backstop.\nThe rest of the withdrawal agreement is largely unchanged from the one negotiated by Mrs May. This includes:\nBrexit was originally meant to happen on 29 March 2019, but the deadline was delayed twice after MPs rejected the deal negotiated by Mrs May, the prime minister at the time.\nMany Conservative MPs and the DUP (the government's then ally in Parliament) were unhappy with the backstop - arguing that the UK could remain trapped in the arrangement for years with no way out.\nAfter MPs voted down the deal for a third time, Mrs May resigned.\nMr Johnson needed a Brexit extension of his own after MPs failed to get the revised deal passed into law.\nThis led to the new deadline of 31 January 2020. \nWith Parliament still in deadlock, Mr Johnson called an early general election, to which MPs agreed.\nThe election, which happened on 12 December 2019, resulted in a Conservative majority of 80.\nWith a sizeable majority in Parliament, it proved straight forward to pass the Brexit legislation.terms & conditions.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the privacy policy to submit your question or send them via email to BBC website.

According to these polls, most Remain (88%) and Leave voters (86%) would vote the same way as in the 2016 referendum. However, those who did not vote in 2016 back Remain by two to one (53% to 26%).\nOne poll conducted since the election, by BMG Research, suggests opinion has not shifted significantly since the election. It put Remain on 52% and Leave on 48%. \nThe lead for Remain is too small to be certain that most voters would prefer Brexit was not happening. However, the evidence certainly does suggest the UK remains more or less evenly divided about Brexit.\nTwo key issues in the 2016 referendum were immigration and the economy. In both cases, Remain and Leave voters still have very different views about what Brexit will mean.\nAccording to research by NatCen, nearly two in five of all voters (38%) think immigration will fall. Just 7% believe it will increase after the UK leaves the EU.\nHowever, nearly half (46%) of those who voted Leave believe immigration will be lower, compared with only 34% of Remain supporters.\nThese figures have not changed much since the EU referendum.\nIn contrast, attitudes towards the economic consequences of leaving the EU have shifted. In September 2016, a few months after the EU referendum, under half (45%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit, while 30% believed it would be better.\nBut in a survey by NatCen during the election campaign, over half (56%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit. Fewer than a quarter (21%) believed it would be better. \nHowever, those who voted Leave are still more likely to say that the economy will be better off (46%) than worse off (21%). In contrast, as many as 84% of Remain supporters believe the economy will be worse off.\nImmigration and the economy will also be important in forthcoming talks about the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will have to decide what rules on immigration it wants and how much it wishes to depart from rules governing what can be bought and sold in the EU. \nConcern about immigration has fallen during the last three years. However, most voters reject current rules which mean anyone from the EU can live and work in the UK, but people from outside the EU must apply to do so.\nDuring the election, nearly three in five (58%) voters told NatCen that EU residents should also have to apply to live and work in the UK. Less than a quarter (22%) said they were against the idea. \nEven among those who voted Remain, nearly half (47%) said they were in favour of this approach.\nIt is figures like these that help explain why the government wants to end freedom of movement.\nMost voters seem keen to keep close economic ties with the EU.\nNo fewer than 86% agree that after Brexit, companies based in the EU should be allowed \"to sell goods and services freely in Britain in return for allowing British companies to sell goods and services freely in the EU\".\nTo realise that ambition, it is likely that the regulations on what can be made and sold in the UK will have to remain fairly similar to those in the EU.\nVoters are not always opposed to keeping to EU rules, particularly when those rules might be thought to favour consumers.\nEven after Brexit, NatCen's research found nearly three-quarters (72%) want UK companies to follow EU rules limiting the cost of using a mobile phone abroad. \nSimilarly, almost four in five (78%), think UK airlines should still follow EU rules requiring them to compensate seriously-delayed passengers.\nAs the UK government seeks the freedom to do things differently, it might well consider that voters could want some things to remain the same - particularly when it comes to their rights as consumers.\nThis analysis piece was More from Sir John Curtice is professor of politics, Strathclyde University, and senior research fellow at commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. and \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714", "title": "Sweets and football: How the UK celebrated joining Europe", "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:20:26 GMT", "summary": "A look at the 11-day \"Fanfare for Europe\" that followed British entry into the EEC in 1973.", "story": "A light show in Downing Street and a new 50p coin will be among official events marking Brexit on Friday. \nDespite some accusations of triumphalism, the tone marks a more muted contrast with British entry into the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. \nA new 50p was also minted back then - featuring nine interlocking hands to reflect the newly-expanded membership of the club. \nBut Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath went further, and organised 11 days of government-subsidised cultural events. \nBeginning three days after entry on 1 January, the \"Fanfare for Europe\" featured hundreds of musical, artistic, and sporting events. \nAs with Brexit in 2020, the occasion was not immune from political wrangling. \nMr Heath, a Europhile who had long dreamed of witnessing British entry into the EEC, known as the Common Market, took an active role in certain events. \nHe attended a special gala at the Royal Opera House, and personally presented prizes to British and EEC children who won free holidays in an essay competition.\nHe also brought down the starting flag on a rally of dozens of vintage cars from London to Brussels.\nThe decision to put himself at the centre of events did not come without risks, however, as some events saw protests from anti-market protestors. \nIn fact, the prime minister was stink-bombed as he arrived for the gala in Covent Garden alongside the Queen. \nIn total, seven government departments and two specially-created temporary committees were involved in devising the programme for the Fanfare.\nCrossbench peer and Arts Council chairman Lord Goodman led a committee responsible for cultural events - while a second committee, chaired by the Conservative peer Lord Mancroft, took the lead in other fields. \nCultural events dominated the schedule, with 25 art exhibitions on European themes arranged, as well as scores of concerts. \nThe Berlin Philharmonic were brought over for special concert, whilst groups such as the Kinks, Steeleye Span and Slade all had gigs. \nAt the Victoria and Albert Museum, an exhibition was put together featuring artwork loaned especially by each of the six existing EEC members. \nDenmark sent two Bronze Age wind instruments, while the Italian donation, a bust of Brutus by Michelangelo, was described in the programme as a \"highly expressive tribute to the fight against tyranny\".\nMeanwhile France, which had twice vetoed British entry into the EEC in the 1960s, sent a 17th Century depiction of card cheating by painter Georges de la Tour. \nHowever an attempt to bring the Mona Lisa to London reportedly failed when a request to send the Rosetta Stone to the Louvre in exchange was turned down. \nAmong the headline events was a special football match at Wembley, which pitted players from the six existing EEC countries against a team composed of players from the UK, Ireland and Denmark, who joined together in 1973. \nThe 'Three', selected by England World Cup-winning manager Sir Alf Ramsey, ran out 2-0 victors with goals from Danish international Henning Jensen and Coventry City striker Colin Stein.\nAmong the British stars who featured were England's Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton, and Scottish international Peter Lorimer. \nGerman international Franz Beckenbauer also took part, although he was taken off at half-time. \nDespite the star appearances, however, ticket sales were slow and only 36,500 fans turned up, not much more than a third of Wembley's capacity at that time.\nLack of enthusiasm did not stop there, with Lord Mancroft admitting to the Times three months before events began that some councils had refused to take part.\n\"But we found a much greater number, who, while not being very enthusiastic, have accepted that British entry is going to happen and are prepared to join us and do their best,\" he added. \nTaxpayer support of \u00a3350,000 - around \u00a34.2m in today's terms - also proved contentious, despite protestations from Lord Goodman to MPs scrutinising expenditure that it was a \"trivial sum of money for this festival\".\nLabour leader Harold Wilson - who had opposed the Conservative deal taking the UK into the EEC - called government subsidies \"an outrage\".\nHe suggested that instead of the festivities, it would have been more appropriate to give all British workers a bank holiday. \nApart from in Scotland, the UK was the only EEC country not to offer its workers time off on New Year's Day at the time it joined - but the first day of the year had long been marked by widespread absenteeism in certain sectors. \nPerhaps recognising the inevitable, Ford and British Leyland were among the firms that voluntarily gave staff that day off in 1973. \nNew Year's Day became a UK-wide bank holiday in 1974. \nEdward Heath also had to fend off accusations that the Fanfare was a propaganda exercise, dominated by highbrow events concentrated in London.\nThings were hardly helped by the timing of Britain's EEC entry, which took place in the midst of a government-imposed pay freeze to control inflation. \nJim Callaghan, a future Labour PM then serving as the party's shadow foreign secretary, made the link when the issue was debated in the Commons. \n\"It might be thought that because the government cannot give the people bread, they are giving them circuses,\" he quipped. \nDespite the differences with today's circumstances, Brexit has bridged the decades with the Fanfare in one respect - with the revival of one element of the EEC festivities that went rather awry back in 1973. \nA 1973 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, entitled \"Sweets\", was brought to an abrupt end on its final day when the display of European confectionary was devoured by schoolchildren who had overwhelmed a guard. \nThe exhibition was recreated to coincide with the expected date of the UK's exit in March last year, alongside a specially-commissioned film from German artist Ulla von Brandenburg. \nAhead of its opening, she told the gallery the exhibition offered the chance to reflect on both the political and culinary tastes of the two periods. \n\"What is funny is that a lot of sweets didn't change,\" she said at the time. \n\"The world has changed a lot since 1973, but not the sweets.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028", "title": "Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 11:52:43 GMT", "summary": "The rise of Euroscepticism - a political creed for so long ignored or ridiculed by the Westminster establishment.", "story": "It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream. \nSo how did Euroscepticism conquer Britain?\nThe word \"Eurosceptic\" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades.\nBritain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out.\nThey rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics.\nIt was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined.\nWith World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe.\nHis, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time.\nMany in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail.\nMost opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. \n\"I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,\" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee.\nThe first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. \nIt had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall.\nEuroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter.\nMaj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Party after being slow-handclapped at the party's conference, believed joining the \"protectionist\" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty.\nHis Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. \nOn 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt. Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided over Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum.\nThere was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum.\nThe vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. \nSome polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. \nWhatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. \nLabour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins.\nMargaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit.\nShe had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a \"social Europe\", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency.\nIt all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975.\nBritain's \"destiny is in Europe\", she stressed, but added: \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.\"\nIt was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier.\nWhich brings us to...\nIn 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: \"We are all Europeans now.\"\nIn November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - \"Up, Yours Delors\", said the headline - to \"tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU\" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro).\nThe rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics.\nIt began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to \"prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate\".\nThe tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to \"ever closer union\" and the free movement of people.\nThe League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact.\nMr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists.\nConservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. \nBut even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about \"reform\" or, if they were in a daring mood, \"fundamental reform\".\nThe mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe.\nHe spent more than \u00a37m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. \nIn many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament.\nUKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. \n\"Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,\" Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week.\n\"It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,\" he added, and UKIP used the \"wherewithal\" provided by the Brussels parliament to \"build a UK political movement\".\nThe same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. \nUKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it.\nA household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column.\nMr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map.\nIt's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's \"People's Army\".\nIn 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them \"extremists\" and \"cranks\".\nTwo years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry.\nSome 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. \nMr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron would announce plans for a referendum just under two years later.\nNigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy.\nUKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. \nThen Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. \nDavid Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party.\nBut he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters.\nIts recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment.

I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place.\"\nThe spying scandal, which involved Iqbal Khan, Credit Suisse's former head of wealth management being chased through the streets of Zurich, rocked the rather staid world of Swiss banking, overshadowing Tidjane Thiam's attempts to overhaul the bank. \nMr Thiam and Mr Khan had previously been close allies, with the wealth management business a cornerstone in the chief executive's turnaround plan. He pivoted the bank away from riskier trading activities, stabilising revenue.  \nThe scandal, which emerged after Mr Khan defected to rival UBS, claimed the jobs of two senior Credit Suisse executives and resulted in a probe from the regulators - but Mr Thiam was cleared of involvement at the time. \nBut as the accusations escalated, a showdown between Mr Thiam and the board ensued. Urs Rohner triumphed: the man responsible for appointing Mr Thiam also determined his departure. Tidjane Thiam has for many years been a high profile figure in the financial world, even resorting to Instagram to put his message out, and denies any wrongdoing   \nThe bank's largest shareholders had publicly called for him to be retained; now the challenge for Credit Suisse is to persuade shareholders that his successor, bank veteran Thomas Gottstein, can continue to restore its fortunes. \nMr Thiam has had an illustrious and varied career. The French Ivorian studied in France and worked in management consultancy before serving as Ivory Coast's Minister of Planning and Development, until a military coup led to him being placed under house arrest. \nHe later became boss of financial services firms Aviva Europe and Prudential before joining Credit Suisse five years ago. \nMr Thiam had attempted to overhaul the Swiss bank, including increased focus on Mr Khan's wealth management division.\nWhile he had initially praised and promoted Mr Khan, there were reports a personal animosity had developed. \nThis intensified after Mr Khan redeveloped a property near Lake Zurich neighbouring that of his boss.\nMedia reports suggested there was an altercation between Mr Khan and Mr Thiam's girlfriend at a cocktail party held by the chief executive at his home, over trees planted on Mr Thiam's property.\nShortly after that Mr Khan announced his departure from Credit Suisse.\nIt later emerged private detectives were hired to track him due to fears he might poach clients when he started work at UBS.\nMr Khan, after noticing he was being tailed, had confronted the person observing him.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51419470": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51419470", "title": "Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:27:28 GMT", "summary": "As the virus spreads to more countries popular with tourists, what are your rights if you cancel?", "story": "The coronavirus is now spreading well beyond China.\nTravellers returning from nine Asian countries and destinations are being advised by Public Health England to avoid contact with other people if they show certain symptoms. \nIn addition to China, the Public Heath England list includes Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.\nHoliday companies and airlines are still taking people to these countries, while insurers say travel policies are unlikely to cover cancellations - except to China. \nTravel agents, tour operators and airlines are being contacted by anxious customers who are thinking of cancelling or re-routing journeys to avoid the places affected. \nAdam Cobb, from Manchester, who was planning to fly to Hong Kong, has been told by his airline that he can get a free re-route or refund.\nBut his travel agent has quoted him a fee of \u00a3700 for a re-route to Singapore. \"I'm at an impasse and have been passed from pillar to post without anyone helping me,\" he says.\nSo, what are your rights if you want to change your plans - or continue with them?\nThe Foreign & Commonwealth Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland China and all travel to Hubei Province.\nSo if you travel against that advice and do manage to get there, you risk invalidating your insurance policy, though you may be able to argue that the trip is essential.\nIf you are there already, travel cover may not be valid in Hubei but should continue elsewhere in China - again, if your stay is essential.\nGenerally speaking, the travel industry is treating trips to these places, save for China itself and sometimes Hong Kong, as business as usual.\nYou can decide not to go to the places on Public Health England's list. But you are likely to be subject to the tour operator or airline's normal cancellation policies.\nLikewise, you will be subject to the standard terms of your travel insurance.\nThe key factor is the date that the Foreign Office started warning people against travelling to a country.\nInsurers will cover cancellations from that point, as long as you have already tried and failed to get the airline or other provider to sort the problem out.\nBut how they help you varies from company to company.\n\"There is no cover in place to cancel a trip to an area where no advice against travel exists,\" says Daniel O'Byrne from one of the leading travel insurers, AXA UK.\nAXA UK says you can claim if you are due to travel within the next 28 days. However, rival insurer Insure & Go will only take a claim within 48 hours of the planned departure, just in case the Foreign Office advice changes.\nIf you have bought a package holiday, the company should refund you the cost of your China trip, although they will have different rules on how far ahead they will allow you to cancel.\nIf China was only part of the holiday the provider can offer alternative holidays. But if there is a significant change to the original arrangements, you don't have to accept and can ask for a full refund instead.\nKuoni Travel told us it was reviewing the situation daily and was contacting people who have bought holidays in China up until the end of April to discuss their options.\nBritish Airways will change or refund bookings to China and Hong Kong up until 29 February, while Virgin Atlantic flights to Shanghai are suspended until 29 March.\nYes, if you are in a country and while you are there the Foreign Office decides to advise against visiting except for essential travel, you should be able to make a \"curtailment\" claim on your policy. You would be able to claim for unused travel and accommodation and reasonable expenses for returning home.\nYou should ask the airline or tour operator to transfer you to an alternative route. If the airline or travel agent charges a fee to amend the flight then a travel insurance policy could come in handy because it may cover the extra charges or the overall cost of cancellation. \nCruise ships are refusing to take passengers who have passed through China, Hong Kong or Macau 14 days before embarkation.

But a new government system in England means he can train just three.\nHe says: \"With the government changes, we're never going to achieve the kind of headway we're looking for.\"\nThe three-person limit for companies using a new digital apprenticeship system is temporary, the government says. If those companies can find colleges or training firms with existing contracts and spare places, they can take on more apprentices. \nBut Mr Daniels cannot do that. The course he needs is much too specialised.\nHis problem is part of a much bigger story. New apprenticeship rules introduced in 2017 see big businesses pay a levy, some of which is shared with smaller firms. \nMany big companies are investing more in their staff, but that means there is less money left over for apprenticeships elsewhere. \nWith apprenticeships costing more than expected, in the words of the National Audit Office, \"there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the programme\". That is an auditor's way of warning the money could run out. \nSince the reforms, the number of new apprenticeships in England has dropped.\nMark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, says: \"What we have done is create a system that has removed the very apprenticeships that are needed.\" \nMeanwhile, English further education colleges that deliver much of this training struggle to recruit after years of low funding. \nCroydon College's principal Caireen Mitchell says: \"We're having more and more problems recruiting specific areas such as plumbing and engineering, or even health and care, because the comparative wages are so low.\"\nIf further education colleges got the same attention as sandstone ones at ancient universities, this would be a bigger row.\nSo what changes now, those in the training industry ask, with a government that has promised to \"level up\" and create a high-skill economy?\nThey say that a little louder now with a Budget on the way. \nPeople are lobbying hard to get a little more cash from an administration that has pledged a \u00a33bn skills fund. Take the complaints of colleges and the training industry at face value though, and much of the \u00a33bn could be needed just to shore up the current system. \nSources say budget negotiations are still going on. But many in government are hopeful that there will be more money for further education. \n\"There is massive will behind this,\" says one. \nThe appointment of a prominent supporter of further education - crossbench peer Alison Wolf - as a Number 10 advisor is significant.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"The apprentice levy means more money is available than ever before for employers of all sizes to invest in training and this year we have increased investment to over \u00a32.5bn, double what was spent in 2010-11 in cash terms.\"\nMeanwhile in Hull, sixty-something trainee docker Gerry Thompson is full of faith in apprenticeships.\nHe says: \"There's always jobs on the docks for everybody. On the docks it's all hands-on. Someone's got to go on board that ship and unload it. It doesn't unload itself.\"\nSome in this government are thoroughly sick of the demands of lobby groups, but they might find both Mr Thompson's optimism, and the political risk of ignoring workers like him, rather harder to ignore. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51383947": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51383947", "title": "PrettyLittleThing advert 'makes me feel good about myself'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:15 GMT", "summary": "An advert banned for over-sexualising women is just 'tapping into fashion trends'.", "story": "A model dressed in vinyl and a bikini top dances with neon poles in a dimly-lit studio.\nIt is not a scene from a music video or a night club promotion but an advertisement for women's clothing which was this week banned for overly-sexualising and objectifying women.\nPrettyLittleThing, the online fashion retailer responsible for the advert, says it \"celebrates all women and body diversity\".\nAnd it seems that many women agree - and don't see what all the fuss is about.\n\"I don't think this objectifies women at all,\" said Lottie Lovelock, 23. \"I think PrettyLittleThing have picked up on the current female trends in the industry and have played to it well.\n\"If you look at what girls are wearing to festivals and on holidays to places like Ibiza then this advert is pretty PG [Parental Guidance rating].\"The Advertising Standards Authority said the advert, which appeared on YouTube, presented PrettyLittleThing's clothing \"in an overly-sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects\".\n\"We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence and was irresponsible.\"\nBut if anything, the ban has strengthened the brand's position, said Julie Palmer, a retail expert at professional services firm Begbies Traynor.\n\"This is what fashion is all about.

If everyone wins, it foregoes its share so that no one gets less back than they put in.\n\"We got sent vaguely encouraging messages over the four weeks and there was a certain amount of chat among the group,\" says Faith.\n\"I had a bit of a panic at the end about whether I had actually done enough to win my bet. But actually, I lost a few pounds more than needed,\" she adds.\n\"Unfortunately, we must have been a really motivated group because it turned out everyone had won their bets. \n\"So I just got my $20 back. In fact, with the exchange rate I think I got slightly less back than I had put in at the beginning. But I had lost the weight and I think it did encourage me.\"\nOn the surface, this looks like one way tech firms are trying to disrupt an existing market - weight loss is big business in the UK.\nHowever, there are real concerns that because it is online and competitive, weight loss wagers could enable unhealthy and even dangerous behaviours. \nA spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association (BDA) told the BBC: \"The fact that they 'gamify' weight loss and add a competitive element to losing weight would be hugely detrimental to those with poor relationships with food. \n\"Those with eating disorders could use a website such as this to justify dieting and restriction for monetary gain. That could have significant impacts on both mental and physical health.\"\nThe eating disorder charity Beat says it is very worried about the potential impact of these wager websites.\n\"The evidence is pretty clear that fitness wagers, fitness apps, anything where the individuals are able to track their weight loss and use that in a competitive or a 'gamification' way is extremely dangerous for people with eating disorders,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"It's been shown to exacerbate their eating disorder behaviours and make recovery much harder.\"\nDifferent companies have different ways to stop people participating if they cannot do so safely. Those include \"flagging systems\" and referees, but none of them are fail-safe.\nAmanda Avery, an obesity specialist dietician and chair of the BDA's Obesity Specialist Group, said that motivation can often help with weight loss, though.\n\"But there are more accessible motivators. Somebody could put a pound in a pot for every pound they lose and then save up and buy themselves a nice new outfit or something.\n\"If they could find some support whereby their diet improves, they manage to increase their physical activity levels, they are going to be much more likely to maintain any weight loss they achieve.\"\nFor Faith, making a wager was simply an extra incentive. But she does acknowledge that a larger or longer wager than hers might have been an issue.\nShe said: \"I think with any process where you are being weighed, there's a danger that people might take it to extremes or not follow a healthy eating plan. But that applies whether it's a bet or a slimming club where you show up in person.\n\"There were bets on offer where you had to put in a significantly larger amount of money for longer periods of time. I was a bit more wary of that.\"\n\"Wagered\" weight loss worked for Faith, but did it last?\n\"Sadly no,\" she says. \"But I kept it off for a few months.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935", "title": "Poorer households may get help on energy bills", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:06 GMT", "summary": "The burden of paying for clean energy technology could be shifted to the tax payer.", "story": "Households struggling with energy bills may get help from a government review of clean technology funding.\nAt the moment, an annual levy is imposed on gas and electricity bills to fund renewables such as offshore wind.\nThe burden falls disproportionately on the poorest in society, and it will get worse as the UK expands clean energy to tackle climate change.\nThe BBC has been told the government may shift the cost onto tax payers to avoid anger at climate policies.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are definitely considering the way that costs are distributed.\"\nCurrently about \u00a310bn a year is being invested to support clean technology.

He said it was a necessary step to ensure the recertification process was \"absolutely bulletproof\".\nHowever, he did add that to carry on working in this way would be \"unsustainable\", and emphasised that the FAA would continue to delegate safety work in future - although the way in which it was done would change.\nMr Dickson also conceded that the FAA needed to rebuild trust in its own performance as a regulator.\n\"That's part of the reason why I'm going to fly the aeroplane\", he said.\n\"I think it sends a strong message of support for my workforce and for the integrity of the process, that I would fly the airplane, and put my own family on it.\n\"I think we owe that to the victims and their families - to ensure that when the aircraft is put back in service, that we are as diligent as we possibly can be.\"\nThe grounding of the 737 Max, which had been Boeing's best-selling plane, \nIt said in January that it expects the bill for the grounding to surpass $18bn (\u00a313.8bn).\nThat hurt the firm's finances, pushing it to a $636m loss for 2019.\nSales were worse than expected in the final three months of last year when the planemaker booked $17.9bn in revenues.\nThat was much lower than $21.7bn that had been expected by analysts.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010", "title": "The women who make argan oil want better pay", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:11:41 GMT", "summary": "Argan is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have, but the women workers want more of the money.", "story": "Whether it is being drizzled on salads or turned into face creams, Morocco's argan oil is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have. But with sales soaring around the world, concerns remain about the pay and conditions of the mainly female workforce that produces the oil.\nI watch as a group of women each use two rocks, one large, one small, to smash open the fruit to get to the seeds inside a very hard central nutshell.\nThey sit on cushions on the floor of a cool stone house, beside big piles of the fruit.\n\"I want a better job, with a better salary,\" says one of the workers, 37-year-old Samira Chari. \"But there is nothing else. This is my only option.\"\nWe are in the Moroccan countryside, some 25km (15.5 miles) inland from the port city of Essaouira, halfway down the country's Atlantic coast. It is warm and sunny, and lush green argan trees pepper the arid landscape.\nThe women are employed by a business called Marjana, one of around 300 small firms, mostly co-operatives, that now produce argan oil by extracting it from the seeds. The trees themselves, which are up to 10m (33 ft) tall, are found all over Morocco.\nOften called the country's \"liquid gold\", global sales of argan oil are soaring, helped by studies that suggest it has health benefits. Production, which is almost all from Morocco, is expected to reach 19,623 US tons or $1.79bn (\u00a31.4bn) by 2022 up from 4,836 US tons in 2014.\nIn Morocco argan is traditionally used as a foodstuff - a dip for bread or drizzled on couscous - and as a medicine. But the big growth in demand is being led by the worldwide cosmetics industry. In addition to face creams, it is now being added to products like lip gloss, shampoo, moisturisers and soaps.\nThe women who harvest the seeds are more often from the Berber ethnic group, and this is the case at Marjana, where staff manager Amina Bouna says they bring age-old skills.\n\"Only Berber women know how to extract the oil,\" she says. \"It's old Berber knowledge. Otherwise we have all types of women here - young, old, married and divorced.\"\nThe 80 women at the company are allowed to work as much as they like. But despite many working from early mornings until evenings, they normally make less than $221 (\u00a3170) a month, says Ms Bouna - below Morocco's recommended national minimum wage.\n\"But it's better than they stay at home,\" argues Ms Bouna. \"Before, they made the oil at home. Their husbands sold it on the market and kept the money. Now they don't need their husbands' money, as they make their own. It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe workers do get some health insurance and pensions provision, but Ms Chari wants to see wages go up. Divorced, she says she has to work long hours to afford medicine for her daughter. She says if she were paid more, she'd be able to spend more time with her child.\nAs the industry becomes more lucrative, the issue of the women's wages has become an increasingly hot topic. Zoubida Charrouf, a chemistry professor at Mohammed V University of Rabat is one of the leading advocates for higher salaries.\nProf Charrouf, who also helped to fuel the growth in argan oil sales after publishing studies into its health benefits, says that salaries can be as low as $50 a month.\nShe adds that some of the companies prefer to pay taxi and bus drivers to bring tourists to their facilities so that they can sell them the oil, rather than pay the workers properly.\nThe situation has become such an issue in the country that Morocco's minister of agriculture asked Prof Charrouf for help in forcing firms to join industry trade bodies, and commit to paying staff the minimum wage.\nProf Charrouf says that this work has now started near the city of Agadir, 175km south of Essaouira, and is due to expand north. \"The women are not happy, and need help to fight,\" she adds.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to requests for a comment.\nProf Charrouf says she is also concerned by the rise of industrial argan oil production, where the oil is extracted mechanically on a large scale, driving down prices. \nOil produced this way can cost as little as $22 a litre, less than half the cost of oil made by the small co-operatives.\nHowever, she adds that she is pleased that cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al \nMore from the \nBack at Marjana, 55-year-old employee Khadija Tiktoutj is much less downbeat about her job harvesting the seeds than her colleague Samira Chari.

The economic cost is also mounting, mainly, but not only, in China. \nThat damage is, for the most part, not due to the virus itself so much as efforts to prevent it spreading.  \nThere are strict restrictions on moving out of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, a city with a population of 11 million. \nThe lockdown, also now extended to other parts of Hubei province, prevents business-related travel as well as the movement of goods and workers.\nFear of the virus also means many people will choose to avoid activities they think might expose them to the risk of infection. \nSo restaurants, cinemas, transport providers, hotels and shops are all quickly feeling the impact.\nAnd the timing of the health crisis, during the lunar New Year break, means those industries have been particularly exposed to commercial losses. \nThe New Year holiday was extended for a few days by the national Chinese authorities and there have been longer extensions imposed by some provincial authorities, delaying the return to work for some businesses even longer. \nAny delay resuming production and selling goods is likely to lead to cash-flow problems, especially for smaller operations.\nMany companies will have to continue paying bills, including employees' pay.\nAnd for manufacturers selling goods abroad, there may be some issues with buyers becoming more reluctant to buy from China.  \nHerbert Wun, who owns Wing Sang Electrical, which makes products such as hair-straighteners and blow-dryers in Guangdong province, told BBC News many companies would not have much slack to take this kind of impact, coming, as it did, on top of the US-China trade war. \nAnd the epidemic \"will add to the pressure on customers trying to shift their supply chain away from China\". \nThe impact is not confined to China.\nInternational retailers have closed operations in China - the furniture seller Ikea and the coffee shop chain Starbucks, for example. \nSeveral overseas airlines have stopped flights to China and international hotel chains have been offering refunds. \nAnd beyond that, there is growing concern about integrated international supply chains. \nChina has a much bigger role in these networks than it did at the time of the last major health problem that emerged from the country - the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) virus 17 years ago. \nHyundai, of South Korea, has suspended its car production because of problems with the supply of parts from its operation in China - an early warning sign of possible extensive disruption ahead. \nChina is an important supplier for the global motor industry and the electronics sector. \nMany mobile phones and computers are made in China or at least have components manufactured there. \nFinancial markets have also felt the effect of the health crisis. \nStock markets around the world are lower than they were two weeks ago. China's market fell 8% on the first day of trading after the holiday.\nThere has been a particularly marked impact on the prices of industrial commodities, as China is such an important buyer. \nCrude oil hit its lowest level in more than a year. \nIt has dropped by about 15% in the past two weeks, reflecting declining demand from China - underlined by reports the country's leading refiner, Sinopec, is cutting back.  \nA group of oil exporting nations is considering production cuts in an effort to reverse the price fall. \nCopper is also cheaper - by about 13% over the past two weeks. \nIt is an important material for the construction industry, which is also sure to be affected in China. \nMany of the suppliers of these commodities are emerging and developing economies.\nIt is early days to attempt to quantify the likely economic effects.\nMuch will depend on how well the Chinese authorities are able to contain the virus. \nBut some forecasters have made rather tentative efforts to put some numbers on the impact.\nOne example is the consultancy Oxford Economics which predicts the Chinese economy will grow less than 4% in the first quarter of 2020 from a year earlier.  \nFor the full year, the forecast is average growth of 5.6%. \nFor both figures, the previous, pre-virus forecast was 6%. \nIt also expects the global economy to grow slightly less - by 0.2 percentage points - than it would have done otherwise.  \nBut Oxford Economic says this is all based on an assumption the \"worst case scenario\" will be avoided. So there is a risk of the economic damage turning out to be more severe. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51208592": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51208592", "title": "How McDonald's revolutionised business", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:10:56 GMT", "summary": "By successfully selling franchises, Ray Kroc turned a tiny hamburger restaurant into a global giant.", "story": "The way Ray Kroc tells the story, when he first encouraged the McDonald brothers to open more hamburger restaurants, they winced. \nThe year was 1954. The place: San Bernardino, California, then a quiet town on the edge of the desert, some 50 miles east of Los Angeles. \nKroc sold milkshake machines and Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald were among his best customers. \nTheir restaurant was small, but sold lots of milkshakes. Clearly, they were doing something right.\nBut they did not want to do more of it, and Mac explained why: \"We sit out on the porch in the evenings and watch the sunset. It's peaceful.\"  \nOpening more branches would be a headache - travelling around, finding locations, vetting managers, staying in motels. Why bother? They were already making more money than they could spend.  \nThis made no sense to Kroc. \"His approach was utterly foreign to my thinking,\" he later recalled. \nSo he convinced the brothers to let him expand their restaurant chain. By the time Kroc died, three decades later, McDonald's had thousands of restaurants bringing in billions of dollars.  \nWhich goes to show that successful entrepreneurs are not all the same. They have different talents, and want different things.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nTake Dick and Mac. They were brilliant at figuring out more efficient ways to make hamburgers. \nAs John F Love notes in his book McDonald's: Behind the Arches, the brothers worked with a local craftsman to invent a new kind of spatula, a new dispenser that squirted the same amount of ketchup and mustard every time, and a rotating platform to speed up the process of assembling of burger, bun and condiments.\nWhat Henry Ford had done for cars, the McDonald brothers did for hamburgers and French fries: they broke down processes into simple, repetitive tasks. \nThis meant they could churn out food quickly, cheaply and consistently. There was nothing else like it. \nBut when it came to the wider world, the brothers seem to have been fairly clueless.\nWhen competitors started peering through the windows, taking out notepads and sketching plans, Dick and Mac laughed about it. When anyone asked about those ingenious condiment dispensers, they cheerfully named their craftsman friend. None of them had bothered to patent the design.  \nSome people wanted more than snatched sketches, so the brothers sold franchises - after a fashion. \nFor a one-off fee, you could buy blueprints to their building, with the golden arches, a 15-page description of their \"Speedee Service System\", and a week's training. After that, the franchisees were on their own.  \nDick and Mac did not expect that their trainees would serve the same menu, or even use the same name. When their very first franchisee mentioned that he would also call his new restaurant \"McDonald's\", Dick replied: \"What the hell for?\"  \nInto this smooth-running kitchen and half-baked franchising operation walked a man with different skills and desires. \nRay Kroc was in his 50s, and managing health problems from diabetes to arthritis.  \nBut he was keener on money than peaceful sunsets, and he loved life on the road. \nKroc later wrote that \"finding locations for McDonald's is the most creatively fulfilling thing I can imagine\".  \nWhere the brothers had rethought French fries, Kroc would rethink the franchise concept.  \nThe idea itself was not new. The word \"franchise\" comes from the old French \"franche\", meaning \"free\" or \"exempt\". \nIn ages past, a monarch might have granted you a franchise which would have given you the exclusive right to do a certain thing - to sell armour, or run a cattle market - in a defined area for a set time. \nIn the 19th Century, for instance, you might have bought the exclusive right to sell Singer sewing machines in your local area. \nNowadays franchise operations are everywhere. Stay in a Hilton or Marriott hotel, rent a car from Hertz or Europcar, or shop at a 7-Eleven or Carrefour grocery store, and you are likely to be dealing with a franchise owner.  \nThe idea of the business format franchise seems \nShe built an international network of beauty salons. A former servant, her franchises transformed the lives of many other servant girls. \nBut it was 1950s fast food that gave the franchise its modern form, with not only McDonald's but Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and many now-forgotten brands.  \nKroc's big insight was the importance of conformity. \nYou were not just selling the right to use the company's name and learn its methods - you were imposing an obligation to do things in a certain way. \nMcDonald's opened a full-time training centre, \"Hamburger University\", which drilled students in subjects such as which kind of potatoes to buy.   \nInspectors wrote 27-page reports on whether franchisees cooked food at the right temperatures and kept the bathrooms clean.\nAt first glance, the appeal to the budding restaurateur is not obvious. \nWouldn't you want to design your own branding and develop your own menu? to have started in the 1890s with Canadian Martha Matilda Harper.  just so it can send an inspector to watch you scrub your own toilets? \nWell, much of what you are paying for is the benefit of the brand - and if you are being monitored to make sure you do not cut corners that damage the brand, you can feel reassured that your fellow franchisees are too.\nAs for the franchisor, why not own and operate new branches yourself? Many companies do both - McDonald's owns about 15% of its 36,000-odd outlets.  \nBut franchisees bring a lot to the company, like hard cash: a McDonald's restaurant can cost more than $1m (\u00a3768,000) to launch.  \nFranchisees also provide local knowledge, especially important if you are expanding into a new country with an unfamiliar culture.\nAnd there is motivation: an owner-manager with their own money at stake might put more effort into keeping costs down than a manager on a corporate salary. \nThe economist Alan Krueger found evidence that may support this idea: workers and shift supervisors apparently earn more in company-owned fast food outlets than franchised ones.  \nOf course, both sides bear some risk. The franchisor has to trust that the franchisee will work hard; the franchisee has to trust that the franchisor will create and advertise exciting new products. \nWhen both sides worry about the other side shirking, it's known as \"double-sided moral hazard\". A branch of economics called agency theory tries to understand how franchise contracts solve this problem through their mix of upfront fees and percentage payments.  \nBut it seems to work, perhaps because - like Kroc and the McDonald brothers - different entrepreneurs want different things. \nSome people want the freedom to run their own business, day-to-day, but are not interested in developing products or building a brand. \nOne of the McDonald brothers' early franchisees decided he did not much like their golden arches, so he got his builders to make them pointy and named his restaurant \"Peaks\" instead.  \nThose were freewheeling times. These days, the division of entrepreneurial labour is more likely to be as regimented as a carousel full of hamburgers.  \nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51379061": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51379061", "title": "Tesla: Is the car firm really worth $150bn?", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 21:56:32 GMT", "summary": "The carmaker's market value has grown by about a third in less than a month.", "story": "When Tesla's market value crossed $100bn (\u00a376.7bn) two weeks ago, overtaking Volkswagen, sceptics scoffed.\nBut on Tuesday, it zoomed past $150bn as shares gained more than 13%, rising to more than $887 apiece.\nThe jump means the firm's share price has more than tripled in the last three months, outpacing the predictions of even some of the most optimistic analysts tracking the company.\nIt now ranks as the world's second most valuable car company. So what's behind the turnaround?\nLess than two years ago, things weren't looking quite as rosy for the carmaker.\nThe firm, which has reported losses every year since its start, faced a cash crunch amid production delays and heavy spending. \nDoubts about performance also dogged chief executive Elon Musk, who had a reputation for making promises but failing to deliver.\nTesla's numbers have since improved. The firm has now reported two quarters of profit and its new factory in Shanghai was up and running more quickly than expected. \nSigns also suggest buyer demand has remained healthy, despite fears of a slowdown. Its new Cybertruck drew in about 200,000 orders, \nThe firm has also avoided self-inflicted mistakes, like the tweets from Mr Musk in 2018, which drew allegations of price manipulation, forcing him to step down as chair of the company.\n\"It has become very clear to investors that Tesla has a number of long-term sustainable growth drivers that are very difficult to dispute,\" says Rolf Bulk, an analyst at New Street Research.\nWolfe Research analysts also said they were \"a little surprised by the magnitude\" of the share price increase but \"the abundance of positives explains the move\".\nIn a note to clients last week, they wrote: \"There may be ups and downs, but our view is the stock has found a new range.\"\nRolf Bulk believes that the recent share price increase suggests that some investors betting against the firm have been squeezed, or forced to cut losses and close out positions - a process that involves buying shares, which drives up prices.\nBut S3 Partners, which tracks such activity, said its research shows that recent buying has mostly been done by a mix of everyday investors and big firms with long-term investment goals.\nTesla's stock has been subject to big swings historically and analysts said prices could dive again. Its performance may take a hit, as it spends to open a new factory in Europe. The coronavirus outbreak has also forced its Shanghai factory to shut down temporarily. \nThe prospect of a weak first quarter is \"something that is not fully appreciated by Wall Street today,\" Mr Bulk said. \nTesla delivered more than 367,500 cars last year - up 50% from 2018. It has forecast sales of about 500,000 this year and analysts project that Tesla could hit two million by 2030.\nIts deliveries remain far smaller than its rivals.even after an embarrassing incident where its \"tough\" windows smashed during an on-stage demonstration., while Volkswagen delivered almost 11 million vehicles last year in the first 11 months of 2019. \nHowever, experts say Tesla's electric car technology continues to lead the industry. The firm might be able to sustain that lead for longer than they had expected, even as demand for electric vehicles grows.\nThere is even speculation that the company's investment in battery power could put it in a position to be a supplier to other leading automotive companies.\nIn a recent note to clients Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said if Tesla could achieve all those outcomes, it might be worth about where it is trading today. \nBut he added that that was \"an aggressive 'blue sky' scenario that could take 10 to 20 years to achieve, if it could even be done at all\".\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40726868": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40726868", "title": "How will the petrol and diesel car ban work?", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 13:54:00 GMT", "summary": "A ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be brought forward by eight years to 2032, MPs say.", "story": "A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars is to be brought forward, the government says.\nSo how could the move help the UK meet its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050? And what does it mean for drivers?\nThe ban is being introduced in 2035 - five years earlier than previously planned.\nExperts said the original target of 2040 would be too late if the UK wanted to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050.\nThe ban is also being expanded to hybrid cars and plug-in hybrids, which had not been included under the original proposals.\nAs a result, people will be able to buy only electric or hydrogen cars and vans.\nAbout a third of CO2 emissions in the UK come from transport. \nSo the ban on conventional car sales will certainly help move the UK towards the net-zero target the government announced in 2019.\nThe Committee on Climate Change, which advises government, said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended temperature rise of 1.5C by 2100. This is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change.\nHowever, banning new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars won't be enough on its own.\nThe government will also need to tackle the emissions coming from energy generation. These are almost as high as from transport and come from things such as industry and people's homes.\nEmissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) - which come from car exhausts - regularly exceed safe levels in many cities.\nDiesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of roadside Nox gases. So removing petrol and diesel vehicles from the roads should help bring air quality within the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nAir pollution has been a concern for decades. But the issue gained renewed urgency when the UK government lost court cases over its plans to reduce nitrogen-dioxide levels. \nAs a result, ministers were ordered by the courts to produce a new plan to tackle Nox levels.\nThe discussion was complicated when carmakers were found to be cheating emissions tests.\nBut in recent years, scientists have become more certain about the ways air pollution harms people. Studies have linked it to heart disease and lung problems, as well as other conditions.\nThe Committee on Climate Change believes the cost of electric cars will be similar to that of petrol or diesel vehicles by 2024-25.\nBut for now, electric cars are more expensive than their petrol or diesel counterparts. \nThat's because battery technology is still developing and production requires expensive raw materials and engineers.\nThe UK's most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf, costs \u00a326,000 for a basic model. The government does provide a \u00a33,500 subsidy but for many motorists, the cost is still too high. \nSome experts say a more radical approach, such as no VAT on electric cars, would create a surge in demand. \nA scheme like this exists in Norway, where 2019 saw a huge increase in people opting for electric cars. \nAt present, there is a very small second-hand market for electric cars. \nThat's because they make up less than 1% of the total number of cars on UK roads. \nIf we're to switch to electric cars, the speed of installing charging points will have to radically increase, to cope with demand. \nIt has been estimated the UK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles. \nThere are now nearly 11,000 places in the UK where you can charge electric vehicles. \nWhile there are parts of the country where the number of charging points is keeping up with demand, more are needed in many places.\nAnd there are other potential problems. \nFor example, where will power points be sited? Will roads have to be dug up for cabling? Will drivers have to share power points, and so be restricted to certain charging times?\nPeople who live in flats, or houses without driveways, could struggle to charge their electric cars at home. \nIt is hoped charge points installed in lampposts next to parking bays could help but rollout so far has been limited.\nThere is also a need for more rapid-charging points, for people on long journeys and those who haven't charged overnight.\nThere is currently no UK-wide scrappage scheme in place for petrol and diesel cars and it is unclear if the government is considering this.\nIn London, the city's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a \u00a325m scrappage scheme to take older polluting cars and motorbikes off its streets, to reduce CO2 pollution.\nYou will still be able to buy a second-hand petrol or diesel car in 2035 and drive one you currently own. \nThere could even be a boom in petrol or diesel sales in 2034, as motorists prepare to buy combustion engines for the final time. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51357030": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51357030", "title": "Coronavirus: 'We may have no clothes left to sell'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 01:34:48 GMT", "summary": "We talk to UK firms affected by the disruption caused by the deadly virus.", "story": "\"At the moment, we'll have no products to sell and we could miss Fashion Week in Europe,\" says Xuzhi Chen, a fashion designer who runs just one of the UK businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. \nThe London-based designer is best known for his luxury womenswear collections. \nHe employs 10 workers in Shanghai who focus on operations and creating samples.

We've seen an increase in sales to China of about 80% year-on-year,\" he said.\nTulip's sales to wholesale businesses and restaurants located in China have seen a boost, where pork is often a staple in diets.\nBut Mr Purnell said the company anticipates congestion in Chinese ports could see a \"short-term impact\" on trade, potentially putting a dampener on strong sales.\nExtra safety measures are in place at Chinese ports. The coronavirus originated in the port city of Wuhan in the Hubei province. \nAs for consumer demand being impacted, Mr Purnell said: \"Things are changing day by day, and we're working under the assumption that the outbreak will be bought under control at some point.\"\n\"Usually, we factor in the Chinese New Year and plan our production around that,\" says Tracey Dawson, the managing director of Daletech Electronics. \nThe company is based in Pudsey outside Leeds, and makes circuit boards. \n\"But, we were surprised to hear that that the factory that was due to send us materials this week is in one of the affected provinces - and is on lockdown,\" she says. \nMany UK technology firms depend on suppliers in China for electronics, but the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted production for some.\nMs Dawson told the BBC's Today programme that most of the materials the company uses are imported from China and other Asian countries.\nShe said that her team were sourcing some products from elsewhere, increasing costs and adding a \"business pressure\".\nShe said: \"The impact is of course, on our customers. We're fighting to maintain delivery, and we will absorb the costs in the short term. \n\"But, if this isn't resolved in a timely manner, we anticipate there could be problems.\"\nCharlie Netherton, UK managing director at Marsh Risk Consulting, said smaller firms often don't have the resources to map out their supply chains and think of alternatives should something go wrong.\nMr Netherton said: \"Now is the time to be proactive, now is the time to plan.\n\"That way, it might be unpleasant but it's not as much of a shock.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51019178": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51019178", "title": "Keeping rats out of kitchens and bedbugs out of hotels", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:13:22 GMT", "summary": "Mouse traps and poison are being replaced by internet connected traps and thermal imaging.", "story": "When construction work disturbed a pack of rats near his commercial kitchen business in County Wicklow, Ireland, Shane Bonner knew he needed a savvier approach to pest control. \nHis existing contract, which used a no-frills bait box and regular site inspections, was falling short at Newmarket Kitchen, a rented facility shared by 17 food producers, and giving the wrong impression.\n\"It's not great business having pest controllers on site regularly - people assume there's a problem rather than an inspection; plus we found they were either around when not needed or if there was an issue, the response wasn't fast enough,\" says the entrepreneur.\n\"If an animal was caught (in the trap) we also had no idea how long it had been there, or when or how it got into the building - which affects our peace of mind when running a food business.\"\nSo he opted for a more hi-tech approach.\nPest Pulse traps use pressure sensor technology to identify a catch and alert the company straight away over the internet.  \nPest Pulse is just one of many businesses looking to disrupt an industry worth \u00a3463m and $13.9bn (\u00a310.6bn) annually, in the UK and US respectively. \n\"By knowing exactly when something was caught you can then start look at the bigger picture by checking cameras to see if one of the loading bay doors was left open,\" says Mr Bonner. \n\"It also means our annual pest management charge has come down by 20% because we're not paying for the labour involved in the usual service; and we don't have people coming around unnecessarily.\"\nTim O'Toole, who co-founded Pest Pulse after working at Google and Ebay, believes the makeover is long overdue in an industry he describes as \"reactive, rudimentary and stuck in 1987\". \n\"All other compliance-based industries, for example, food storage using smart fridges, have embraced the IoT [internet of things]. But with pest management we still had a guy checking a box in the corner every 12 weeks and writing the result down on a piece of paper which isn't good enough - rats can multiply very fast.\n\"We've got rising levels of infestation so traditional pest control contracts are having to increase the number of visits from controllers - additional labour costs that will be passed onto the customer,\" he says. \n\"Plus, we're seeing much tighter legislation on the use of biocides [poisons]. Increasingly, its use has to be based on evidence of infestation. So a cost-effective, targeted, tech-led approach with reduced environmental impact becomes much more critical.\"\nBut what if the infestation is harder to find?\nThermal imaging cameras have become a popular tool to detect pests at night or in cavity walls, floors and roofs, illuminating their outline and pinpointing the source for faster, efficient removal. \nPest controller Thomas Bonny in Noyers, France, became aware of the technology's potential in his previous role as a firefighter where it was used to improve visibility in heavy smoke. Using a solution from US manufacturer, FLIR systems, the camera has transformed how he removes wasp nests, by cutting costs and time. \n\"In the past, we relied on sound rather than sight to find a nest, but locating this very faint noise can be very difficult and time consuming,\" he says. \n\"For a single inspection, a thermal imager can save you one or more hours depending on how difficult it is to reach. But it also allows you to quickly find the exact spot of the nest, which means that you only do the minimum required damage. There is no need to rip out entire walls or ceilings to find the right location.\"\nIt explains the growth of thermal imaging in the hotel sector, where the need to detect bedbugs the size of an apple seed, is an increasing problem. Here, the impact of stringent pesticide controls is making it harder to eradicate bed bugs - affecting hotels' reputations and their profits.\nA 2016 study by pest control company, Orkin, of US hotels found that eight of 10 had dealt with an infestation over the previous year, with the average cost per outbreak of $6,383 in replacement of soft-goods, treatment and lost business.\nThe traditional reliance on a diligent housekeeping is no longer cutting it, says Robert Fryers, the chief executive of Spotta, a Cambridge-based business which has developed a more advanced way of tackling such infestations.\nDesigned by entomologists, the Spotta pod, is positioned in the bedbug's sweet spot between the mattress and bedframe, the pod contains a synthetic pheromone that draws the insects into the trap usually within hours of their arrival.\n\"Bedbugs have always been a problem for hotels but with climate change and the rise in international travel from hot countries it has become much worse - although it isn't talked about much in the industry. \n\"Historically, hotels could only deal with this reactively, when a guest complained, and by that point the damage is done,\" says Mr Fryers.\nAlgorithm analysis identifies the insect, distinguishing between a tropical bedbug, carbon beetle or silverfish and a camera takes a picture with all data emailed to the hotel. The contents of the pod are then sealed in and returned to Spotta's laboratory for sterilization. \n\"People assume these bugs are down to a hotel's poor cleanliness. But they are brought in by people from their clothes and bags, which is why we're finding the greatest traction with city and airport hotels that have a high turnover of international guests,\" says Mr Fryers. \n\"In the US, lawsuits and compensation claims on the issue are becoming more prevalent. Hotels need to be able to demonstrate they are doing everything they can.\"\nSo while it might seem expensive to employ hi-tech pest control, it could save some even bigger legal bills.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073", "title": "The medieval knight who went into space", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:07:16 GMT", "summary": "Multimillionaire computer games veteran Richard Garriott is also a pioneer of space tourism.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

It also allowed him to follow in the footsteps of his father Owen, an astronaut who twice went into space with Nasa, in 1973 and 1983.\nRichard had wanted to join Nasa, too, as a younger man, but his ambition was blocked because his eyesight was not good enough. Instead he started to design computer games as a teenager. \nRaised near Houston, Texas, Richard remembers his high school getting its first computer in the mid-1970s.  As he was an excellent science student, he says that the teachers let him use it as often as he liked.\n\"They basically said 'well, we have this computer that we don't know what to do with - it's yours, do what you want with it'.\"\nDiscovering that he was something of a natural at computer programming, he started to design his own games. In 1979, aged 18, one of his games was released commercially.\nWorking part time in a computer store, Richard had shown his role-playing game - Akalabeth: World of Doom - to his manager. The man was so impressed that he asked Richard to make copies that he could sell from the shop.\nIt caught the eye of one of the first gaming distributors, who said he wanted to ship them nationwide. Some 30,000 copies were sold, from which Richard was paid $150,000 in royalties \"for a few weeks of afterschool time at high school\". \nThat amount of money was nearly three times his father's annual Nasa salary. \"I sat down with the rest of the family, who said 'well, this is a good idea, maybe you should do more of these', and I started my career.\"\nHis parents did, however, insist that he still went to university, and so he enrolled on a degree at the University of Texas at Austin. While at college he released the first instalment of his fantasy world, role-playing game series Ultima. Think dungeons and dragons, medieval knights, and wizards. \nWith Ultima 1 selling 50,000 copies, Richard ultimately dropped out of college to focus on making computer games full time. And together with his brother he set up a business called Origin Systems to release the later versions of the game.\nThe Ultima series went on to sell millions of units, and gained a dedicated following within the growing gaming community. Richard would connect with devotees by going to fan conventions dressed in medieval costume, as a character from the game called Lord British. \nHowever, on one occasion things took a dark turn when a crazed fan broke into his Texan house, and Richard had to fire off warning shots from his Uzi machine gun to defend himself before the police arrived.\nIn 1992, Richard and his brother sold Origin to gaming giant Electronic Arts for $35m. Richard stayed with Electronic for eight years, before leaving to create a new business called Destination Games. A number of other gaming firms then followed, with his current company - Portalarium - formed in 2008.\nConsidered a pioneer within the gaming community, it is widely accepted that Richard was the first person to use the term \"avatar\" to apply to the on-screen representation of a person playing a computer game.\nHe says he still loves working in the industry. \"I am a very light-hearted person,\" he says. \n\"I'm a devout believer in work should be fun. If work is not fun, you are doing the wrong work.\n\"Maybe that's idealistic, and it's not fair to presume everyone in life can have that opportunity. [But] if you can enjoy the work you're doing, it makes life better, and so that's one of the markers of success, being able to do that.\"\nTo help get himself into space, Richard co-founded a company called Space Adventures in 1998. Unlike the continuing efforts of Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's Space X, Space Adventures didn't set out to build its own spacecraft. Instead it would arrange for its customers to hitch a ride on the flights of the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Nasa was also asked, but said \"no\".\nThe first person to get into space thanks to Space Adventures was American businessman Dennis Tito, who in 2001 became the world's first space tourist. Richard's trip came seven years later, and although he co-owns the company he still had to pay the full price. Space Adventures has so far put seven people into space.\nFred Schmidt, a Texan technology consultant, says that \"Richard's number one trait in his ongoing entrepreneurial journey is how his boundless imagination plays in tandem with his insatiable curiosity\". \nMeanwhile, Richard Wiese, president of the Explorers Club, a professional society that promotes scientific exploration, says that Richard \"is often the smartest and most creative person in the room\".\nHe adds: \"The idea that Richard would figure a way to get himself into space when ordinary paths proved impossible speaks volumes on how he views the possible. I often wonder if Richard gets the proper credit for being one of the first pioneers in private space.\"\nLooking ahead, Richard says he wants to return to space. \"I dream about my past and future space flights,\" he says. \"Having travelled once to space only deepens your desire to spend more time there.\n\"I experienced what many astronauts refer to as 'the overview effect', which makes your bond and care of the Earth greatly deepen.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376101": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376101", "title": "Food Chain: Pumping up gluten balloons", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:15:50 GMT", "summary": "Baker Lizzie Parle demonstrates the properties of gluten, by pumping it up like a balloon.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51399436": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51399436", "title": "Overdrafts: A guide to your changing bank fees", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:16:57 GMT", "summary": "It's the biggest change in overdrafts in a generation and could mean you paying double.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51406197": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51406197", "title": "Meet the cannabis chef leading a culinary revolution", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:12:09 GMT", "summary": "Andrea Drummer is the woman behind the first cannabis cafe in the US, but for now you may still want to BYO brownies.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51284286": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51284286", "title": "How the rubber duck became a million dollar idea", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:25:13 GMT", "summary": "The BBC's Aaron Heslehurst explains how the rubber duck became a million dollar idea.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51404388": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51404388", "title": "Coronavirus: Shanghai's deserted streets and metro", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:48:55 GMT", "summary": "Amid China's coronavirus, the BBC's Robin Brant shows how Shanghai's streets are now largely empty.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51312928": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51312928", "title": "CEO Secrets: Can you be the boss if you're in chronic pain?", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:12:30 GMT", "summary": "Shazia Ginai, who suffers from chronic pain, found that it was no barrier to being a CEO.", "story": ""}}, "science": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51405079": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51405079", "title": "OneWeb: London start-up launches first big batch of satellites", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 23:14:18 GMT", "summary": "The UK-based firm launches 34 spacecraft for its broadband internet mega-constellation.", "story": "The UK-based OneWeb company has sent 34 satellites into orbit on a single Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.\nThe start-up is building a mega-constellation in the sky to deliver broadband internet to all corners of the globe.\nSix spacecraft were lofted in 2019 to prove the technology, but this year will see big batches of platforms going up on a near monthly basis.\nThe aim is to have the full network in operation by the end of 2021.    \nOneWeb is in a race with a number of other companies that want to provide the same kind of service.\nCalifornia entrepreneur Elon Musk is developing his Starlink constellation which envisages thousands of connected satellites. \nLikewise, the boss of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, the world's wealthiest individual, has proposed a system he calls Kuiper.\nBut OneWeb CEO Adrian Steckel says his start-up has nothing to fear from these \"100lb gorillas\". \n\"I  think they're going to do great; we're going to do great,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's room for three or four of us. The world is a big place and the appetite for data is insatiable. This won't be a game of 'winner takes all'.\"\nThe Soyuz rocket left Baikonur at 02:42 local time on Friday, 7 February (21:42 GMT on Thursday, 6 February).\nIts mission was to drop its satellite batch into one of 12 planes planned for the constellation. Next month, another Soyuz will loft a further 34 spacecraft to begin populating two more planes.\nEventually, the full network will comprise 648 satellites (60 of which will be in-orbit spares ready to fill behind any failures).\nIt's an ambitious roll-out made possible by high volume manufacturing at a factory set up in Florida by OneWeb and the aerospace giant Airbus, who are partners on the the project.\nUp to two spacecraft a day are now rolling off the production line.\nBut while the media are very focused on the numbers of satellites and rockets involved, these elements won't define the west London company's future success or failure.\nThis will depend more on the relationships OneWeb is able to establish with the telcos and other organisations that will be exploiting and distributing its internet service around the world.\nIt's partly because of this that OneWeb is emphasising its \"Britishness\".\nAlthough founded by an American with backing from some big international brands, the firm believes the UK association will help it obtain the \"landing rights\" necessary for its service to be allowed to operate in different countries.\n\"We consider ourselves as an international project, but we navigate in a difficult world where not everybody gets along,\" Mr Steckel said. \"And our sense is that the UK's flag and approach allows us to have dialogue with partners that we otherwise might not have the ability to do.\" \nElon Musk and his SpaceX company have already entered a high cadence of launches, with 240 Starlink satellites placed in orbit since May last year. But the rapid deployment means this American project has walked first into the backlash that may ultimately confront all the coming mega-constellations.\nAstronomers have been complaining that the internet satellites are too bright. They fear that if thousands of spacecraft are put in orbit, it could seriously impede their view of the cosmos. \nOneWeb has so far avoided much of the flack because until Friday's flight, it had put up only six test satellites. This could now change with the monthly roll-out.\nBut Mr Steckel believes his company's spacecraft won't attract the same ire.\n\"It's our understanding that our satellites will be less visible - one, because they're higher in the sky; and, two, because of their design. But we're engaging with the astronomical community. And that's not just PR - we really want to see what we can do.\"\nLast month, both OneWeb and SpaceX met with European scientists for discussions at the Royal Astronomical Society in London. @BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51375600": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51375600", "title": "Climate change: Loss of bumblebees driven by 'climate chaos'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 01:25:20 GMT", "summary": "\"Climate chaos\" has caused widespread losses of bumblebees across continents, experts say.", "story": "\"Climate chaos\" has caused widespread losses of bumblebees across continents, according to scientists.\nA new analysis shows the likelihood of a bee being found in any given place in Europe and North America has declined by a third since the 1970s.\nClimbing temperatures will increasingly cause declines, which are already more severe than previously thought, said researchers.\nBumblebees are key pollinators of many fruits, vegetables and wild plants.\nWithout them, some crops could fail, reducing food for humans and countless other species.\nDr Tim Newbold of University College London (UCL) said there had been some previous research showing that bumblebee distributions are moving northwards in Europe and North America, \"as you'd expect with climate change\". \nHe added: \"But this was the first time that we have been able to really tie local extinctions and colonisations of bumble bees to climate change, showing a really clear fingerprint of climate change in the declines that we've seen.\"\nBumblebee declines are already more severe than previously thought, said lead researcher Peter Soroye of the University of Ottawa in Canada. \"We've linked this to climate change - and more specifically to the extreme temperatures and the climate chaos that climate change is producing,\" he said. \nBumblebees are among the most important plant pollinators. Declines in range and abundance have been documented from a range of causes, including pesticides, disease and habitat loss.\nIn the new study, researchers looked at more than half a million records of 66 bumblebee species from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014.\nThey found bumblebee populations declined rapidly between 2000-2014: the likelihood of a site being occupied by bumblebees dropped by an average of over 30% compared with 1901-1974. \nBees have been hardest hit in southern regions such as Spain and Mexico due to more frequent extreme warm years.  And, while populations have expanded into cooler northern regions, this has not been enough to compensate for the losses.\nJonathan Bridle and Alexandra van Rensburg of the University of Bristol described the findings as \"alarming\". Commenting in the journal Science, they said: \"The new study adds to a growing body of evidence for alarming, widespread losses of biodiversity and for rates of global change that now exceed the critical limits of ecosystem resilience.\"\nThere are around 250 species of bumblebee in the world. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), declines have been documented in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia, caused by a variety of threats that range from habitat loss and degradation to diseases and pesticide use. \nFollow Helen \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51398485": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51398485", "title": "Fireflies face extinction risk - and tourists are partly to blame", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:35:23 GMT", "summary": "Tourists love the sight of fireflies glowing at night but it can kill the insects, scientists say.", "story": "Firefly tourism is on the rise globally but scientists are warning it may contribute to risk of the insect's extinction.\n\"I spotted a hundred flickering lights, illuminating a palm like a Christmas tree.\"\n\"Our guide waved his flashlight at the fireflies.

They are killing the next generation,\" Prof Lewis says.\nIn Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, the industry has existed for a few decades, but is usually poorly-managed, she explains.\nCongregating Mangrove fireflies live exclusively in mangrove trees along rivers.\nMales gather in huge numbers to attract females, producing the appealing glowing swarms that tourists desire.\nMotorised boats are driven up the rivers, creating water swells that erode the banks, killing the trees where the fireflies live.\n\"Operators also crash boats into the banks to disturb trees and make fireflies fly out, creating a swarm for tourists to see,\" Prof Lewis explains. \n\"There is evidence that even just camera flashes disturb fireflies and interfere with their reproductive success, in addition to the flashlights used by tourists\".\nProf Lewis is keen to emphasise that firefly tourism is often crucial to local economies and should not be banned.\nInstead tour operators and tourists can develop eco-friendly practices.\nTravel blogger Katie Diederichs and her husband, both from the US, chose an eco-friendly tour operator in Bohol, Philippines for their firefly experience in 2015. \nTravelling in a small group at night in kayaks with just one light, the experience was designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, Katie explains.\n\"The amount of light from the fireflies made the mangroves look like Christmas trees - it was really magical. \n\"The male fireflies were flying around, giving the illusion of twinkling, while the females blink.\" \nThe company is run by locals who love the fireflies and want to protect their environment, she explains.\nBut Katie says they witnessed other operators with \"large motorboat of tourists\" passing by them \"sending waves in our direction.\"\nIn Taiwan, the tourist board has invested in sustainable firefly tours and created \"thoughtful and effective\" firefly eco-tourism, Prof Lewis explains.\nSites have regulated guided tours with raised walkways that allow small groups of people to walk through the habitat without trampling on fireflies. \nInstead of flashlights or headlamps that would disturb the insects, white paint illuminates the routes.\nA group of scientists will meet in 2020 to set down guidelines for how to run a sustainable firefly tourism company, Prof Lewis says.\n\"It is very important to not disturb the fireflies' habitat while photographing,\" \nShe regularly photographs the Big Dipper firefly, as well as other wildlife, where she lives in the Catskill mountains in New York.\nWatch where you walk, she says, and be careful with your light sources.\n\"And for goodness sake, please don't ever capture them!\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935", "title": "Poorer households may get help on energy bills", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:06 GMT", "summary": "The burden of paying for clean energy technology could be shifted to the tax payer.", "story": "Households struggling with energy bills may get help from a government review of clean technology funding.\nAt the moment, an annual levy is imposed on gas and electricity bills to fund renewables such as offshore wind.\nThe burden falls disproportionately on the poorest in society, and it will get worse as the UK expands clean energy to tackle climate change.\nThe BBC has been told the government may shift the cost onto tax payers to avoid anger at climate policies.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are definitely considering the way that costs are distributed.\"\nCurrently about \u00a310bn a year is being invested to support clean technology.

Both are expensive.\nA few years ago, government economists predicted that gas plants equipped with CCS would be producing 30% of the UK\u2019s clean electricity in the future. Nuclear and renewables would produce another 30% each.\nTom Burke, an expert on climate change, forecast at that time that only CCS could save the climate. When I reminded him yesterday, he admitted: \u201cI was wrong\u201d.\nThe equation radically changed because the nuclear renaissance didn\u2019t happen; the government pulled funding from CCS projects; and the cost of renewables plummeted. \nThe government has now offered new CCS funds - but for tackling carbon emissions from industrial clusters, rather than from power generation. \nThe new technology report comes from a government-funded consortium of academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London.\nIt\u2019s being debated in the Lords on Thursday. The debate\u2019s sponsor, Baron Browne of Ladyton, said it carries important messages that should be heard. \nThe report says: \u201cBusinesses and the public want to act to eliminate emissions, but exaggerated claims about the speed at which new technologies can be introduced are holding back progress.\"\nIt continued: \u201cRelying on breakthrough technologies to achieve zero emissions by 2050 is risky and delays action. \n\u201cInstead, with today\u2019s technologies we can meet the target for almost all activities, but we have no substitutes for cement, shipping, flying, lamb or beef.\u201d \nThe report says the UK can anticipate having four times as much emissions-free electricity in 2050 as today if current rates of renewables expansion continue. \nThis, it says, is enough to supply 60% of today\u2019s energy-using activities, if they are electrified. \nIt says to close the remaining energy gap, we could make incremental changes to the way we use technologies - such as buying smaller cars rather than SUVs.\nAnother option is to take the train instead of the car, or put more passengers in fewer cars (ride sharing).\nYet another possibility is to only heat rooms where people are sitting, and swap gas boilers for heat pumps when they need to be changed. \nThe government, the report says, should start a debate on these issues.\nIt says the two outstandingly difficult areas to de-carbonise are shipping and cement manufacture.\nJulian Allwood, lead author and professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, told BBC News: \"The problem with delivering climate mitigation is the tension between the government wanting to deliver solutions based on technology and protestors and scientists asking for fast action that bites much more rapidly than we can bring new technologies into place. \n\"So although new technologies may become relevant by 2100, the number operating at scale in 2050 will be very few. Probably we\u2019ve got to deliver on climate change with today\u2019s technologies.\"\nThe message contradicts several comments from the Prime Minister putting faith in technology to deliver 2050 targets. Recently, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no one needed to fly less, and that technology would solve the problem.\nThe government has committed to having CCS in industrial clusters from the second half of the 2020s and CCS at scale by 2030.\nThe net zero scenario from the Committee on Climate Change includes 75-175 Megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 being captured and stored per year by 2050.\nThe report's authors say it typically takes 30 years for a major new technology such as carbon capture to solve all its complexities, including legal and safety implications; and public concerns, before it begins to be widely adopted. \nBut this will be too late to hit the government's 2050 targets.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Achieving net zero by 2050 requires decisive action across the economy, including developing a range of approaches and technologies. \n\"Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), for example, can play an essential role as part of a balanced approach.

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

She held a simple sign, black letters on a white board, that said \"School Strike for Climate.\"\n\"It felt like I was the only one who cared about the climate and the ecological crisis,\" she told the BBC. The 15-year-old was by herself, but not for long.\nWithin a year, her school strike, carried on through all weather, had inspired millions of young people around the world to take to the streets and demand action on climate change. \nAs thousands of students again protest in major global cities, here's a look at what we know about the teenager who started it all.\nMs Thunberg, the elder of two girls, was born on 3 January, 2003. She grew up in Stockholm with her mother Malena Ernman, an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant, and her actor father Svante Thunberg. Her father is a descendant of Svante Arrhenius, a scientist who came up with a model of the greenhouse effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. \nMs Thunberg said her parents were \"as far from climate activists as possible\" before she made them aware of the issue. She persuaded her parents to become vegan, and in 2016 convinced her mother to stop flying, despite her mother frequently travelling overseas for work. \nThey have co-written a book with their daughter called Our House is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis. It is set to be released in March. \nMs Thunberg has Asperger's Syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift and a superpower.\nShe says she first learned about climate change when she was eight and couldn't understand why people weren't taking action. \n\"I remember thinking it was very strange that we were capable of changing the entire face of the Earth and the precious thin layer of atmosphere that makes it our home. Because if we were capable of doing this, then \n\" she wrote in the Guardian.\nIn May 2018, Ms Thunberg won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper. Three months later, she decided to start protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue until the government met the why weren't we hearing about it everywhere?. \nMs Thunberg said her parents weren't enthusiastic about her protest at the start, and told her that she would have to do it without their help. \nAfter she was pictured outside the Swedish parliament building with her sign, the teenager's protests went viral on social media. \nAs support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world, and the message spread with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. \nMs Thunberg travelled to some of the strikes in Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment. \nIn April, she made an appearance at the Extinction Rebellion protests in London, telling the crowd: \"For way too long, the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.\"\nIn September, Ms Thunberg travelled to New York address the UN Climate Conference. She made her way there on a zero-emissions boat in a journey that lasted two weeks. \nThe week of her arrival, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence.  \nDuring her address at the UN, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. \n\"How dare you,\" she said. \"I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? \n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We will be watching you.\"\nAt the end of 2019, she was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. \nHer message has not been well received by everyone, carbon emissions target set out by world leaders in Paris in 2015. But she has responded defiantly and often with humour.\nAfter her UN appearance, US President Donald Trump appeared to mock her by saying she \"seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\".\nMs Thunberg then changed her Twitter biography to include Mr Trump's words. She did the same weeks later when Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\".\nIn January, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the teenager to most notably prominent conservative voices. His comments came after she called on world leaders to abandon fossil fuels at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nAs for the teenager's schooling, she took the whole of 2019 off school to be able to attend the climate conference in New York and the world's major annual climate summit in Madrid in December.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317", "title": "Mud wasps used to date Australia's aboriginal rock art", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:18:54 GMT", "summary": "Scientists use the remains of wasps\u2019 nests to date Australia\u2019s ancient aboriginal rock art.", "story": "When the veteran telecoms engineer Damien Finch went on a three-week bush walk in Australia's Kimberley region, he became enthralled with its rock art.\nOn his return home, he tried to find out more about these enigmatic aboriginal paintings and engravings.\n\"I couldn't believe how little was known about them; we didn't even know how old they were,\" Damien said.\n\"It seemed disrespectful that scientists hadn't studied this stuff more; it was downplaying the importance of the culture,\" he told BBC News.\nNow, 10 years on and in his 60s, Damien is putting that right.\nHe's approaching the end of his doctoral research on the topic, and \n, has published his own efforts to age the Kimberley's so-called Gwion figures.\nThese feature finely painted human forms, often in elaborate ceremonial dress and carrying spears and boomerangs.\nIt was thought they were painted some 16,000 years ago, but the University of Melbourne investigator has been able to show the likely age is nearer in time - at about 12,000 years ago. \nDating rock art is really hard. Aboriginal artists use iron oxide pigments (ochre) which contain no organic material and are therefore resistant to any radiocarbon analysis.\nDamien has got around this by studying instead the scraps of organic matter stuck on top of and underneath the paintings.\nAnd for this, he's working with wasps. In particular, the ones that build nests out of mud. There's a wide group of these.\nSome will enclose their prey - such as a paralysed spider or caterpillar - inside an earthen box. Before sealing the lid, the wasps lay an egg on the unfortunate victim. The developing larva then consumes the immobile spider or caterpillar, eventually digging its way out of the nest as an adult to carry on the cycle.\nFrom Damien's point of view, when the female wasp gathers her mud supplies she inevitably picks up fragments of charcoal from the Kimberley's fire-prone landscape. And this charcoal can be radiocarbon dated.\nHe's examined the remains or more than 20 ancient nests at various rock art sites. \nMaterial that smothers pigment gives a minimum age; underlying material provides a maximum age.\nA distribution of dates from many locations enables an estimate to be made for when the Gwion style was in vogue. \n\"All this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea-levels. Things like that.\"\nThe paintings he and his team have been working on are, of course, sites of immense cultural significance. \nAll the sampling was guided and approved by representatives from the traditional owners of the artwork.  \n\"We couldn't have done what we did without their active support and encouragement,\" Damien told BBC News.\nHe's hopeful the mud-wasp dating technique can now be used at more locations right across the north of Australia, and perhaps at other rock art locations in the Americas and Europe. \nGavin Broad is the principal curator in charge of insects at London's Natural History Museum. He described the Australian research as \"very smart\".  \n\"There was a paper about this some years ago, but the techniques seem to have improved since then,\" he told BBC News.\n\"In this study, the nests are made by \n, which are wasps of the family Sphecidae, superfamily Apoidea.  \n\"These are well-known mud-daubers in much of the warmer parts of the world.  \n\"However, the real diversity of potter wasps is in the Eumeninae, a subfamily of Vespidae (superfamily Vespoidea).  Their nests range from holes in mud to simple cells (like \n) to ornate little pots.  \n\"There are also some spider-hunting wasps (family Pompilidae), which represent at least a third evolution of making clay nests.\"\n and follow me on Twitter: \nin this week's Science Advances journal\n@BBCAmos\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382", "title": "The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 21:16:05 GMT", "summary": "When Li Wenliang warned about a Sars-like virus at his hospital in Wuhan, authorities tried to silence him.", "story": "Dr Li Wenliang, who was hailed a hero for raising the alarm about the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak, has died of the infection.\nHis death was confirmed by the Wuhan hospital where he worked and was being treated, \nDr Li, 34, tried to send a message to fellow medics about the outbreak at the end of December.

In comparison, more than 40 male scientists or their discoveries were mentioned.\nMeanwhile, a separate poll conducted by the charity revealed half of people are unable to name a single female scientist, alive or dead.\nBut it is not just Britain's men who have made pioneering scientific discoveries. Here are some of the overlooked British women whose research changed the world.\nSomerville was named the 19th Century's \"queen of science\" after her death.\nHer popular books linked up and explained different areas of scientific study, and her detailed work on the solar system was influential in the discovery of Neptune.\nShe made history in 1835 when she jointly became the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society in London.\nSomerville has been on the Royal Bank of Scotland's \u00a310 notes since 2017.\nA self-taught pioneer, Anning discovered Jurassic remains in her hometown of Lyme Regis.\nShe came across her first find - an ancient reptile later named an Ichthyosaurus - at the age of 12.\nThe Natural History Museum calls her the \"unsung hero of fossil discovery\", as the scientific community was reluctant to recognise her contributions to science during her lifetime.\nShe was not allowed to be part of the Geological Society of London, for example. In fact, it did not admit women until more than half a century after her death.\nAda Lovelace was a leading 19th century mathematician credited with creating early computer programs.\nShe worked with her friend Charles Babbage, an inventor and mechanical engineer, on his proposals for an \"Analytical Engine\".\nThe device was never built, but the design had the essential elements of a modern computer.\nHer notes described how codes could be created for the handling of letters, symbols and numbers. \nShe also created a method for the machine to repeat a series of instructions - a process known as \"looping\", which computer programs still use today.\nGarrett Anderson was the first woman to qualify in the UK as a doctor - but it wasn't easy to get there.\nIn her mid-20s, she enrolled as a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital in London.\nShe attended lectures and observed the male medical students, but no university would let her take the exams to become a doctor.\nHowever, after finding that the Society of Apothecaries couldn't legally refuse her, she qualified in 1865. \nShe subsequently opened the St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children in London and co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women. \nShe was the sister of Suffragist leader Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and campaigned for women's right to vote.\nWiddowson devoted her life to improving people's diets in Britain and overseas.\nIn 1940, when food was being rationed during World War Two, she published a book called The Chemical Composition of Foods that contained details of the nutritional values of many foods.\nShe was one of the dieticians who oversaw the addition of vitamins to food during wartime rationing.\nHodgkin was born in Cairo to a British couple who were working in the north African country during a period when it was under British control.\nBut she herself largely spent her childhood in Norfolk and was educated at a state school in Beccles, Suffolk, \nShe used X-ray technology to discover the structures of penicillin, insulin, and vitamin B12.\nIn 1964 she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry - and is still the only British woman to have done so.\nShe also lectured former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who studied chemistry at Somerville College in Oxford in the 1940s.\nFrom 1976 to 1988, Hodgkin was president of the Pugwash Conference, an international organisation set up in the 1950s to assess the dangers of nuclear weapons.\nProfessor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell is credited with one of the most important discoveries of the last century: the discovery of radio pulsars.\nPulsars are the by-products of supernova explosions that make all life possible.\nProf Bell Burnell was overlooked for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974, even though the award went to two male academics who worked alongside her.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073", "title": "The medieval knight who went into space", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:07:16 GMT", "summary": "Multimillionaire computer games veteran Richard Garriott is also a pioneer of space tourism.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Richard Garriott, computer games veteran, and space tourism pioneer.\nBlasting into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket, Richard Garriott says it was \"the most intense eight and a half minutes\" of his life.\nLaunched from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan, it took just that amount of time for the rocket to hit 28,000 km/h (17,000mph) and reach orbit.\nThis was back in October 2008, when Richard became only the sixth person to go into space as a paying traveller. He spent 12 days on the International Space Station. \"It was a truly profound and life-changing experience,\" says the 58-year-old.\nThe trip was the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition for Richard, who, thanks to making a fortune in the computer games industry, could afford the price - a whopping $30m (\u00a323m). It also allowed him to follow in the footsteps of his father Owen, an astronaut who twice went into space with Nasa, in 1973 and 1983.\nRichard had wanted to join Nasa, too, as a younger man, but his ambition was blocked because his eyesight was not good enough. Instead he started to design computer games as a teenager. \nRaised near Houston, Texas, Richard remembers his high school getting its first computer in the mid-1970s.  As he was an excellent science student, he says that the teachers let him use it as often as he liked.\n\"They basically said 'well, we have this computer that we don't know what to do with - it's yours, do what you want with it'.\"\nDiscovering that he was something of a natural at computer programming, he started to design his own games. In 1979, aged 18, one of his games was released commercially.\nWorking part time in a computer store, Richard had shown his role-playing game - Akalabeth: World of Doom - to his manager. The man was so impressed that he asked Richard to make copies that he could sell from the shop.\nIt caught the eye of one of the first gaming distributors, who said he wanted to ship them nationwide. Some 30,000 copies were sold, from which Richard was paid $150,000 in royalties \"for a few weeks of afterschool time at high school\". \nThat amount of money was nearly three times his father's annual Nasa salary. \"I sat down with the rest of the family, who said 'well, this is a good idea, maybe you should do more of these', and I started my career.\"\nHis parents did, however, insist that he still went to university, and so he enrolled on a degree at the University of Texas at Austin. While at college he released the first instalment of his fantasy world, role-playing game series Ultima. Think dungeons and dragons, medieval knights, and wizards. \nWith Ultima 1 selling 50,000 copies, Richard ultimately dropped out of college to focus on making computer games full time. And together with his brother he set up a business called Origin Systems to release the later versions of the game.\nThe Ultima series went on to sell millions of units, and gained a dedicated following within the growing gaming community. Richard would connect with devotees by going to fan conventions dressed in medieval costume, as a character from the game called Lord British. \nHowever, on one occasion things took a dark turn when a crazed fan broke into his Texan house, and Richard had to fire off warning shots from his Uzi machine gun to defend himself before the police arrived.\nIn 1992, Richard and his brother sold Origin to gaming giant Electronic Arts for $35m. Richard stayed with Electronic for eight years, before leaving to create a new business called Destination Games. A number of other gaming firms then followed, with his current company - Portalarium - formed in 2008.\nConsidered a pioneer within the gaming community, it is widely accepted that Richard was the first person to use the term \"avatar\" to apply to the on-screen representation of a person playing a computer game.\nHe says he still loves working in the industry. \"I am a very light-hearted person,\" he says. \n\"I'm a devout believer in work should be fun. If work is not fun, you are doing the wrong work.\n\"Maybe that's idealistic, and it's not fair to presume everyone in life can have that opportunity. [But] if you can enjoy the work you're doing, it makes life better, and so that's one of the markers of success, being able to do that.\"\nTo help get himself into space, Richard co-founded a company called Space Adventures in 1998. Unlike the continuing efforts of Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's Space X, Space Adventures didn't set out to build its own spacecraft. Instead it would arrange for its customers to hitch a ride on the flights of the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Nasa was also asked, but said \"no\".\nThe first person to get into space thanks to Space Adventures was American businessman Dennis Tito, who in 2001 became the world's first space tourist. Richard's trip came seven years later, and although he co-owns the company he still had to pay the full price. Space Adventures has so far put seven people into space.\nFred Schmidt, a Texan technology consultant, says that \"Richard's number one trait in his ongoing entrepreneurial journey is how his boundless imagination plays in tandem with his insatiable curiosity\". \nMeanwhile, Richard Wiese, president of the Explorers Club, a professional society that promotes scientific exploration, says that Richard \"is often the smartest and most creative person in the room\".\nHe adds: \"The idea that Richard would figure a way to get himself into space when ordinary paths proved impossible speaks volumes on how he views the possible. I often wonder if Richard gets the proper credit for being one of the first pioneers in private space.\"\nLooking ahead, Richard says he wants to return to space. \"I dream about my past and future space flights,\" he says. \"Having travelled once to space only deepens your desire to spend more time there.\n\"I experienced what many astronauts refer to as 'the overview effect', which makes your bond and care of the Earth greatly deepen.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51097309": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51097309", "title": "Antarctica melting: Climate change and the journey to the 'doomsday glacier'", "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 05:00:03 GMT", "summary": "Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \"doomsday glacier\", is reported to be melting quicker than previously thought - scientists are now trying to find out why.", "story": "Sediment sweeps past the camera as Icefin, a bright yellow remotely operated robot submarine, moves tentatively forward under the ice.\nThen the waters begin to clear.\nIcefin is under almost half a mile (600m) of ice, at the front of one the fastest-changing large glaciers in the world.\nSuddenly a shadow looms above, an overhanging cliff of dirt-encrusted ice.\nIt doesn't look like much, but this is a unique image - the first ever pictures from a frontier that is changing our world.\nIcefin has reached the point at which the warm ocean water meets the wall of ice at the front of the mighty Thwaites glacier - the point where this vast body of ice begins to melt.\nGlaciologists have described Thwaites as the \"most important\" glacier in the world, the \"riskiest\" glacier, even the \"doomsday\" glacier.\nIt is massive - roughly the size of Britain.\nIt already accounts for 4% of world sea level rise each year - a huge figure for a single glacier - and satellite data show that it is melting increasingly rapidly.\nThere is enough water locked up in it to raise world sea level by more than half a metre.\nAnd Thwaites sits like a keystone right in the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet - a vast basin of ice that contains more than 3m of additional potential sea level rise.\nYet, until this year, no-one has attempted a large-scale scientific survey on the glacier.\nThe Icefin team, along with 40 or so other scientists, are part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a five-year, $50m (\u00a338m) joint UK-US effort to understand why it is changing so rapidly.\nThe project represents the biggest and most complex scientific field programme in Antarctic history. \nYou may be surprised that so little is known about such an important glacier - I certainly was when I was invited to cover the work of the team.\nI quickly discover why as I try to get there myself.\nSnow on the ice runway delays my flight from New Zealand to McMurdo, the main US research station in Antarctica.\nThis is the first of a whole catalogue of delays and disruptions.\nIt takes the science teams weeks just to get to their field camps.\nAt one stage, the entire season's research is on the point of being cancelled because storms stop all flights to West Antarctica from McMurdo for 17 consecutive days.\nWest Antarctica is the stormiest part of the world's stormiest continent.\nAnd Thwaites is remote even by Antarctic standards, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from the nearest research station.\nOnly four people have ever been on the front of the glacier before and they were the advance party for this year's work.\nBut understanding what is happening here is essential for scientists to be able to predict future sea level rise accurately.\nThe ice in Antarctica holds 90% of the world's fresh water, and 80% of that ice is in the eastern part of the continent.\nThe ice in East Antarctica is thick - more than a mile thick on average - but it rests on high ground and only creeps sluggishly to the sea.\nSome of it has been around for millions of years.\nWestern Antarctica, however, is very different. It is smaller but still huge, and is much more vulnerable to change. \nUnlike the east it doesn't rest on high ground. In fact, virtually the whole bed is way below sea level. If it weren't for the ice, it would be deep ocean with a few islands.\nI've been in Antarctica five weeks before I finally board the red British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter that takes me to the front of the glacier.\nI will be camping with the team at what is known as the grounding zone.\nThey are camped on the ice above the point where the glacier meets the ocean water, and have the most ambitious task of all.\nThey want to drill down through almost half a mile of ice right at the point where the glacier goes afloat.\nNo-one has ever done that on a glacier this big and dynamic.\nThey will use the hole to get access to the sea water that is melting the glacier to find out where it is from and why it is attacking the glacier so vigorously.\nThey do not have long.\nAll the delays mean there are just a few weeks of the Antarctic summer left before the weather starts to get really bad.\nAs the members of the drilling team set up their equipment, I help out with a seismic survey of the bed beneath the glacier.\nDr Kiya Riverman, a glaciologist at the University of Oregon, drills down with an ice auger - a large spiral stainless-steel drill bit - and sets small explosive charges.\nThe rest of us dig holes in the ice for the \"georods\" and \"geophones\" - the electronic ears that listen to the echo of the blast that bounces back from the bedrock through the layers of water and ice.\nThe reason the scientists are so worried about Thwaites is because of that downward sloping submarine bed.\nIt means the glacier gets thicker and thicker as you go inland.\nAt its deepest point, the base of the glacier is more than a mile below sea level and there is another mile of ice on top of that.\nWhat appears to be happening is that deep warm ocean water is flowing to the coast and down to the ice front, melting the glacier.\nAs the glacier retreats back, yet more ice is exposed.\nIt is a bit like cutting slices from the sharp end of a wedge of cheese.\nThe surface area of each one gets bigger and bigger - providing ever more ice for the water to melt.\nAnd that is not the only effect.\nGravity means ice wants to be flat. As the front of the glacier melts, the weight of the vast reservoir of ice behind it pushes forward.\nIt wants to \"smoosh out,\" explains Dr Riverman. The higher the ice cliff, she says, the more \"smooshing\" the glacier wants to do.\nSo, the more the glacier melts, the more quickly the ice in it is likely to flow.\n\"The fear is these processes will just accelerate,\" she says. \"It is a feedback loop, a vicious cycle.\"\nDoing science of this scale in such an extreme environment is not just about flying a few scientists to a remote location.\nThey need tonnes of specialist equipment and tens of thousands of litres of fuel, as well as tents and other camping supplies and food.\nI camped on the ice for a month, some of the scientists will be out there for far longer, two months or more.\nIt took more than a dozen flights by the US Antarctic programme's fleet of huge ski-equipped Hercules cargo planes just to get the scientists and some of their cargo to the project's main staging post in the middle of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nThen smaller planes - an elderly Dakota and a couple of Twin Otters - ferried the people and supplies on to the field camps, hundreds of miles down the glacier towards the sea.\nThe distances are so great they needed to set up another camp halfway down the glacier so the planes could refuel.\nThe British Antarctic Survey's contribution was an epic overland journey that brought in hundreds of tonnes of fuel and cargo.\nTwo ice-hardened ships docked alongside an ice cliff at the foot of the Antarctic Peninsula during the last Antarctic summer.\nA team of drivers in specialist snow vehicles then dragged it more than a thousand miles across the ice sheet through some of the most inhospitable terrain and weather on earth.\nIt was tough going, the top speed was just 10mph.\nThe scientists at the grounding zone camp plan to use hot water to drill their hole through the ice.\nThey need 10,000 litres of water, which means melting 10 tonnes of snow.\nEveryone sets to work with spades, hefting snow into the \"flubber\" - a rubber container the size of a small swimming pool.\n\"It'll be the most southerly jacuzzi in the world,\" jokes Paul Anker, a British Antarctic Survey drilling engineer.\nThe principle is simple - you heat the water with a bank of boilers to just below boiling point and then spray it onto the ice, melting your way down.\nBut drilling a 30cm hole through almost half a mile of ice at the front of the most remote glacier in the world is not easy.\nThe ice is about -25C (-13F) so the hole is liable to freeze over and the whole process is dependent on the vagaries of the weather.\nBy early January, the flubber is full and all the equipment is ready but then we get a warning that yet another storm is on its way.\nAntarctic storms can be very intense. It is not unusual to have hurricane force winds as well as very low temperatures.\nThis one is relatively mild for Antarctica but still involves three days of wind gusting up to 50mph. It blows huge drifts of snow into the camp, swamping the equipment, and all the work stops.\nWe sit in the mess tent playing cards and drinking tea and the scientists discuss why the glacier is retreating so rapidly.\nThey say what is happening here is down to the complex interplay of climate, weather and ocean currents.\nThe key is the warm seawater, which originates on the other side of the world.\nAs the Gulf Stream cools between Greenland and Iceland, the water sinks. \nThis water is salty, which makes it relatively heavy, but is still a degree or two above freezing.\nThis heavy salty water is carried by a deep ocean current called the Atlantic conveyor all the way down to the south Atlantic.\nHere it becomes part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, flowing deep - a third of a mile (530m) - below a layer of much colder water.\nThe surface water in Antarctica is very cold, just above -2C degrees, the freezing point of salt water.\nThe deep warm circumpolar water travels all the way around the continent but has been increasingly encroaching on the icy edge of West Antarctica.\nThis is where our changing climate comes in.\nThe scientists say the Pacific Ocean is warming up and that is shifting wind patterns off the coast of West Antarctica, allowing the warm deep water to well up over the continental shelf.\n\"The deep Antarctic circumpolar water is only a handful of degrees warmer than the water above it - a degree or two above 0C - but that's warm enough to light this glacier up,\" says David Holland, an oceanographer with New York University and one of the lead scientists at the grounding zone camp.\nI was supposed to leave Antarctica at the end of December but all the delays mean the drilling only begins on 7 January.\nThat is when the satellite phone call comes from the United States Antarctic Program HQ in McMurdo.\nWe are told we cannot delay our flights off the continent any longer and must leave on the supply plane that is due to arrive at the camp in an hour or so.\nIt is very frustrating to be forced to leave before the hole is finished and the instruments have been deployed, especially given how long it took to get here.\nWe say our goodbyes and board the plane.\nI look back and see the wheel at the top of the drill turning, the black hose spooling out steadily.\nThey are almost half way down through the ice.\nThe plane flies up over the camp and directly north, out towards the ocean. \nThe scientists had told me that we had been camped on what is basically a small bay of ice protected by a horseshoe of raised ground.\nAs we fly out over the front of the glacier, I realise with a shock just how fragile a fingerhold it is.\nThere is no mistaking the epic forces at work here, slowly tearing, ripping and shattering the ice.\nIn some places the great sheet of ice has broken up completely, collapsing into a jumble of massive icebergs which float in drunken chaos. \nElsewhere, there are cliffs of ice, some of which rise up almost a mile from the sea bed.\nThe front of the glacier is almost 100 miles wide (160km) and is collapsing into the sea at up to two miles (3km) a year.\nThe scale is staggering and explains why Thwaites is already such an important component of world sea level rise, but I am shocked to discover there is another process that could accelerate its retreat even more.\nMost glaciers that flow into the sea have what is known as an \"ice pump\".\nSea water is salty and dense which makes it heavy. Melt water is fresh and therefore relatively light.\nAs the glacier melts, the fresh water therefore tends to flow upwards, drawing up the heavier warmer sea water behind it.\nWhen the sea water is cold, this process is very slow, the ice pump usually just melts a few dozen centimetres a year - easily balanced by the new ice created by falling snow.\nBut warm water transforms the process, according to the scientists.\nEvidence from other glaciers shows that if you increase the amount of warm water that is reaching the glacier the ice pump works much faster.\n\"It can set glaciers on fire,\" says Prof Holland, \"increasing melt rates by as much as a hundred-fold.\"\nThe small plane takes us to the camp in the middle of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet but more bad weather means more delays and it is nine days before a Hercules comes to take us back to McMurdo.\nBy then we have been joined by some of the scientists.\nIt has been a very successful season.\nThey have confirmed that the deep circumpolar warm water is getting under the glacier and have collected huge amounts of data.\nIcefin, the robot submarine, has managed to make five missions, taking a host of measurements in the water beneath the glacier and recording some extraordinary images.\nIt will take years to process all the information the team has gathered and incorporate the findings into the models that are used to project future sea level rise.\nThwaites is not going to vanish overnight - the scientists say it will take decades, possibly more than a century.\nBut that should not make us complacent.\nA metre of sea level rise may not sound much, particularly when you consider that in some places the tide can rise and fall by three or four metres every day.\nBut sea level has a huge effect on the severity of storm surges, says Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey.\nTake London.\nAn increase in sea level of 50cm would mean the storm that used to come every thousand years will now come every 100 years.\nIf you increase that to a metre then that millennial storm is likely to come once a decade.\n\"When you think about it, we shouldn't be surprised by any of this,\" says Prof Vaughan as we are preparing to board the plane that will take us back to New Zealand and then home.\nEver-increasing carbon dioxide levels are putting a lot more heat into the atmosphere and the oceans. \nHeat is energy, and energy drives the weather and ocean currents.\nIncrease the amount of energy in the system, he says, and inevitably big global processes are going to change. \n\"They already have in the Arctic,\" says Prof Vaughan with a sigh. \"What we are seeing here in the Antarctic is just another huge system responding in its own way.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366", "title": "Coronavirus: How worried should we be?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:30:04 GMT", "summary": "Tens of thousands of people have been infected with a newly-discovered virus.", "story": "A virus - previously unknown to science - is causing severe lung disease in China and has also been detected in other countries.\nPeople are known to have died and the outbreak shows no sign of stopping soon. \nA new virus arriving on the scene, leaving patients with pneumonia, is always a worry and health officials around the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency. \nCan this outbreak be contained or is this something far more dangerous?\nOfficials in China have confirmed the cases are caused by a coronavirus. \nThese are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. \nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.\n\"There is a strong memory of Sars, that's where a lot of fear comes from, but we're a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases,\" says Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust.\nIt seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath and some patients needing hospital treatment. \nThe World Health Organization says data from 17,000 patients suggests 82% have mild disease, 15% are severe and 3% critical.\nNotably, the infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose or sneezing.\nThe coronavirus family itself can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold all the way through to severe lung problems, which can kill.\nWhile the ratio of deaths to known cases appears low, the figures are unreliable.\nIt is far too simplistic to divide the number of deaths by the number of cases to calculate the death rate to get a figure of around 2% at this stage of the outbreak.\nThousands of patients are still being treated and we do not know if any of those cases will die - so the death rate could be higher. \nAnd it is unclear how many unreported mild cases are out there - so the death rate could also be lower.\nThis virus is not really \"new\" - it is just new to humans, having jumped from one species to another.\n\"If we think about outbreaks in the past, if it is a new coronavirus, it will have come from an animal reservoir,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. \nMany of the early coronavirus cases were linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan. \nSars started off in bats and then infected the civet cat, which in turn passed it on to humans. \nAnd Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which has killed 858 out of the 2,494 recorded cases since it emerged in 2012, regularly makes the jump from the dromedary camel.\nWhile some sea-going mammals can carry coronaviruses (such as the Beluga whale), the South China Seafood Wholesale Market also had live wild animals, including chickens, rabbits, snakes, which are more likely to be the source. \nThe new virus is closely related to one found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\nHowever, South China Agriculture University has suggested the virus could have moved from bats to pangolins and finally to humans. \nTwo reasons - people coming into close contact with animals harbouring viruses and dense urban populations that allow it to spread. \n\"No-one is surprised the next outbreak is in China or that part of the world,\" says Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh.\nIt largely spreads when infected people cough droplets containing the virus into the air that infect those nearby.\nInitially, the Chinese authorities said the virus was not spreading between people.\nBut now we know each infected person is passing the virus on to between two and three other people.\nThis figure is the basic reproduction number of the virus - anything higher than one means the virus is self-sustaining.\nIn other words, this is not an outbreak that will burn out on its own and disappear.\nMostly when people are coughing, however, Chinese scientists have suggested some people may be infectious even before their symptoms appear. \nThe time between infection and symptoms - known as the incubation period - lasts up to 14 days. \nSars and Ebola are contagious only when symptoms appear. Such outbreaks are relatively easy to stop: identify and isolate people who are sick and monitor anyone they came into contact with.\nBut \"symptomless spreaders\" are much harder to stop. \nThere are thousands of new cases being reported each day.\nHowever, outbreak analysts believe these are only the tip of the iceberg.\nTheir mathematical models suggest the true scale of the outbreak could be 10 times larger than the official figures. \nMultiple groups have estimated the number of cases is doubling every five to seven days. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus is a public health emergency of international concern - as it did with swine flu and Ebola.\nIt said it has done so in order to provide extra support to lower and middle-income countries with weaker health systems that might not be able to spot or isolate cases of coronavirus.\nThe virus seems to be quite stable, so far.\nHowever, it is possible for viruses to mutate and that is something scientists will be watching closely.\nThe World Health Organization say the outbreak can be contained, but this is not a universally shared view.\nExperts, including the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control, argue the virus could become a pandemic - a global epidemic.\nIt\u2019s highly likely that #2019nCov will be a #pandemic, spreading beyond #China. We don\u2019t know yet whether the pandemic will be mild, moderate or severe. Key is to find and implement the best ways to protect people. \nEnd of Twitter post  by @DrTomFrieden\nThe only way it can be stopped is to prevent people who have become infected from spreading the virus to others. \nThat means:\nA massive feat of detective work will also be needed to identify people who have been in close contact with patients to see if they have the virus.\nNo.\nHowever, the work to develop them is already under way and it is hoped there will be human trials before the end of the year. \nAnd hospitals are testing anti-viral drugs to see if they have an impact. \nA combination of two drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - was successful in the Sars epidemic and is being tested in China during this outbreak.\nBut at the moment, treatment relies on the basics - keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight the virus off.\nColds and flu tend to do their main business in the winter months, so there is hope that the turning of the seasons may help stem the outbreak. \n\"Schools are closed for a long time in the summer and that helps limit the spread of many of these respiratory infections,\" said Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nHowever, Mers-coronavirus emerged in the summer in Saudi Arabia. \n\"These viruses can certainly spread during the high temperature seasons, but the extent of the spread is what's important,\" said Prof David Heymann.\nChina has done something unprecedented anywhere in the world - effectively putting entire cities into quarantine.\nThe central province of Hubei, which includes Wuhan, is in lockdown with around 60 million people affected. \nBeijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day.\nHubei province has even switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside.\nDr Golding says: \"At the moment, until we have more information, it's really hard to know how worried we should be.\n\"Until we have confirmation of the source, that's always going to make us uneasy.\"\nProf Ball says: \"We should be worried about any virus that explores humans for the first time, because it's overcome the first major barrier.\n\"Once inside a [human] cell and replicating, it can start to generate mutations that could allow it to spread more efficiently and become more dangerous. \n\"You don't want to give the virus the opportunity.\"pic.twitter.com/ZJjJuXylv6.\nUse this form to ask your question: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51296585": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51296585", "title": "Capella Space radar company chases persistent vision", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 17:00:12 GMT", "summary": "The American start-up Capella says it's now ready to deploy its fleet of all-weather Earth observers.", "story": "When one of your \"companies to watch\" goes quiet for a period of time, you begin to wonder what's going on. \n\"Have you heard from Capella Space recently? Weren't they supposed to have launched more satellites by now?\" I asked a journalist colleague in December. \"Yeah, I was thinking the exact same thing,\" she replied. \nAnd then up pops the US company and all is explained. \"Ah, so that's what they've been doing.\" Capella is developing a commercial constellation of small, low-cost Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. These will be capable of sensing the Earth's surface in all weathers, day or night. \nIt's an activity that has traditionally been dominated by Big Government - the national space agencies and the military - because of the expense and complexity of doing radar from orbit. \nBut the technologies being exploited now by so-called \"New Space\" companies are challenging the old ways of doing things. \nCapella put up one 48kg \"demonstrator\" spacecraft called Denali in late 2018 and was expecting to follow that with two more operational platforms in 2019 and a further 12 in 2020. \nWith this gradual roll-out would have come steadily improving performance. \nBut then, as CEO Payam Banazadeh told me, a few hands started to go up from prospective customers who said they'd rather skip straight to the better quality images of the later satellites. \nAnd so the company took the difficult decision to halt its roll-out and bring forward future upgrades. Hence the period of quiet in 2019 as Capella sought to rebuild its next batch of satellites. \n\"We heard the market,\" the former Nasa engineer said. \"Our initial customers will be in defence and intelligence, and they're hooked on high quality and high resolution. And so we need to be sure that from the get-go, we are known for that as well. \n\"Because we've seen it before with other players - it's very difficult to change customers' perception of you after you've already given them a product. You'll be flagged and known for that product, whatever that is, even if your next iteration is much improved.\" \nLast week, at the Global Geospatial Intelligence Conference in London, Capella revealed details of its new spacecraft. They're bigger (although still under 100kg) and with greater performance. They should now deliver narrow strip scenes of Earth up to 4,000km in length at a ground resolution of 50cm - and better, down to 30cm for US government-approved customers.\nThe first satellite in this new batch, Sequoia (named after another US National Park), is booked onto a SpaceX rocket for a March lift-off. The hope then is to get another six up before the year's end. However, this will depend strongly on launcher availability.\nI've written quite a bit recently about the European \"competitor\" to Capella - the Finnish company Iceye. Both are trying to break the mould by opening a market for persistent radar imaging where the same spot on the Earth's surface is imaged every hour or so. It's achieved by having multiple spacecraft flying overhead - 36 in the case of Capella; 18 in the case of Iceye. \nI say \"competitor\", but in truth these companies seem to be focussing in different areas at the moment. If Capella is going to major on defence and intelligence, Iceye is building a reputation in the maritime sector. Evidence of this is the new service Iceye is offering to find ships that try to hide illegal activity, such as unregulated fishing. \nBut such is the newness of what both companies are doing, they probably need their combined efforts right now to build better awareness of what SAR is all about. \nWorking in the news business, I certainly recognise this. Satellites that can see the Earth's surface even through thick cloud and in the dark are first with those pictures of the volcano that's just blown its top or the oil tanker that's been attacked in the Gulf. \nBut there will be many commercial sectors that simply haven't clocked yet what SAR can do for them. \nOne other issue before I close. You'll probably have seen the kerfuffle surrounding the constellation of Starlink broadband satellites being launched by SpaceX. \nTheir brightness in the sky has caught the ire of astronomers who worry these artificial points of light will impede their view of the cosmos. \nThe SAR constellations haven't escaped this scrutiny, although the questions being asked take a different tack. \nAt the recent American Astronomical Society meeting in Hawaii, Dr Harvey Liszt from the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory raised the concern that powerful radar pulses from orbit could damage the radio receivers that scientists employ in their ground observatories.\nPayam Banazadeh told me Capella was taking this matter very seriously and was keen to co-ordinate his company's activities with the AAS. \n\"We have also been in contact with Dr Liszt and are actively working to safeguard their mission when operating our SAR constellation. \n\"Whether it is observing Earth or deep space, Capella believes in exploration and scientific discovery. We also believe in and support protecting the mission of the radio astronomy community.\"  @BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49836270": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49836270", "title": "Nambi Narayanan: The fake spy scandal that blew up a rocket scientist\u2019s career", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:01:02 GMT", "summary": "Falsely charged with selling secrets to Pakistan, Nambi Narayanan's life was knocked off course.", "story": "One winter afternoon a quarter of a century ago three policemen arrived at a house in a narrow lane in the southern Indian city of Trivandrum, the capital of the state of Kerala.\nThe officers were polite and respectful, Nambi Narayanan remembers.\nThey told the space scientist that their boss, a deputy inspector general of police, wanted to talk to him.\n\"Am I under arrest?\" Mr Narayanan asked.\n\"No sir,\" the officer said. \nIt was 30 November 1994. The 53-year-old scientist led the Indian space agency's cryogenic rocket engine project, and was responsible for acquiring the technology from Russia. \nMr Narayanan walked out to the waiting police vehicle. He asked whether he should sit in the front or the back - suspects were usually dumped in the back seat.\nThe policemen asked him to sit in the front, and the Jeep rolled out of the lane.\nWhen they arrived at the police station, the boss wasn't there, so Mr Narayanan was asked to wait on a bench. Policemen gaped at him as they passed by.\n\"They had that look as if they were looking at someone who had done some crime,\" Mr Narayanan says. \nHe waited and waited. The boss didn't turn up.\nAs night fell, he dozed off on the bench. When he woke up next morning, he was told he was under arrest.\nA scrum of journalists had arrived, and within hours newspapers were describing him as a traitor - a man who had sold rocket technology to Pakistan, after falling into a honey trap set by two women from the Maldives. \nHis life was never the same again.\nNambi Narayanan was the first boy in a middle-class family, after five girls. His father was a businessman, trading in coconut kernel and fibre. His mother stayed at home to look after the children. \nYoung Nambi was a good student and topped his senior class. He went to an engineering school, got a degree and worked in a sugar factory for a while, before joining the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). \"I always had a fascination for aircrafts and flying objects,\" he says. \nAt the agency, he rose rapidly through the ranks until he won a scholarship to study rocket propulsion systems at Princeton University. He rejoined the space agency when he returned home a year later. \nAt Isro Mr Narayanan worked with the stalwarts of India's space programme: scientists like Vikram Sarabhai, its founder and first chairman, Satish Dhawan, his successor, and Abdul Kalam, who later became India's 11th president.\n\"When I began working with Isro, the space organisation was in its infancy. We never really had a plan of developing any rocket systems. We were planning to use rockets from the US and France to fly our payloads,\" Mr Narayanan says. \nBut the plan changed, and Mr Narayanan became a key figure in the project to develop homegrown Indian rockets.\nHe worked diligently as a scientist until his life was turned upside down in November 1994.\nA month before his arrest, the Kerala police had arrested a Maldivian woman, Mariam Rasheeda, on charges of overstaying her visa. Weeks later, they picked up her friend, Fauziyya Hassan, a bank worker visiting from Male, the capital of the Maldives. A major scandal then erupted.\nInspired by police leaks, local newspapers reported that the Maldivian women were spies stealing India's rocket \"secrets\" and selling them to Pakistan, in cahoots with scientists at the space agency. \nMr Narayanan, it was now claimed, was one of the scientists who had succumbed to the women's charms.\nThe day he was formally arrested, Mr Narayanan was produced in court.\n\"The judge asked me whether I would confess to the crime. I asked, 'What crime?' They said, 'The fact that you have transferred the technology.' I couldn't understand anything,\" he remembers.\nThe judge remanded him to judicial custody for 11 days. A memorable image from that time shows the scientist walking down the steps of the court building, dressed in a dark-coloured shirt and light grey trousers, surrounded by policemen.\n\"I was in a shock, and then a trance. At one instance it appeared to me that I was watching a movie - with me as the central character,\" Mr Narayanan wrote in his memoirs.\nOver the next few months, his dignity and reputation were torn to shreds. He was charged with violating India's official secrets law and corruption, among other things.\nHis interrogators beat him up and handcuffed him to a bed. They forced him to stand and answer questions for 30 hours on end. They made him take lie-detector tests even though the results are not admitted as evidence in Indian courts.\nThen they took him to a high security prison, where one of his co-prisoners was a \"serial killer\" who had bludgeoned his victims to death. (The man told Mr Narayanan that he had been reading about the case and that he could tell that the scientists were innocent.)\nMr Narayanan told the police that rocket secrets \"could not be transferred by paper\" and that he was clearly being framed. The fact that India was still struggling to obtain cryogenic technology to make powerful rocket engines didn't cut any ice with the detectives.\nIn the end, Mr Narayanan spent 50 days in captivity - including nearly a month in prison. Whenever he was taken to a court hearing, crowds appeared shouting that he was a spy and a traitor.\nBut a month after his arrest India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the case from Kerala's Intelligence Bureau. Mr Narayanan told federal detectives that none of the information he dealt with was classified. \"I don't know how this whole thing has come to this stage. We are terribly sorry,\" one detective told him.\nAfter finally securing bail on 19 January 1995, he arrived home shortly before midnight.\nHe went upstairs to break the news to his wife. She was sleeping on the floor in a dark room, and responded only after he called out her name twice.\n\"She turned around slowly, raised her head and stayed still, staring into my eyes. She had a strange expression, as if she was watching me doing something horrible,\" Mr Narayanan recounted later. \n\"Then she let out a shriek that I had never heard - from a human or an animal.\"\nThe cry coursed through the house. Then she fell silent.\nHer husband's incarceration and absence had severely affected Meenakshi Ammal's mental health. The couple had been married for nearly three decades and had brought up two children together, but after Mr Narayanan's arrest the austere temple-going woman had slipped into depression and stopped talking.\nApart from Mr Narayanan, five others had also been accused of espionage and transferring rocket technology to Pakistan. One was his colleague at Isro, D Sasikumaram; there was also Ms Rasheeda and her friend (neither of whom Mr Narayanan had met, before he was arrested); and two other Indian men, an employee of the Russian space agency and a contractor. \n1994 - Narayanan arrested and remanded in custody, then bailed in January 1995\n1996 - Exonerated by the Central Bureau of Investigation\n1998 - Supreme Court finally dismisses Kerala government's appeal\n2001 - Kerala government ordered to pay compensation\n2018 - Supreme Court orders investigation into fabrication of case \nIn 1996, the CBI's final 104-page report exonerated all of them. Federal detectives said there was no evidence of any confidential documents being stolen from the space agency and sold, or of money being exchanged for drawings of engines. An internal investigation by Isro also found that no drawings of the cryogenic engines were missing.\nMr Narayanan went back to work for Isro - though now in an admin role in Bangalore - but his travails hadn't come to an end. Even after the detectives closed the case, the local government tried to reopen it, and dragged in the Supreme Court, which finally dismissed the case in 1998.\nWhen Mr Narayanan sued the Kerala government for framing him, he was awarded five million rupees ($70,000; \u00a353,000). Last month, the government said it would \n rupees as compensation for his illegal arrest and harassment. \nBut from the 78-year-old's point of view, the story is not finished yet. In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into the role of the Kerala police in the fabrication of the case against him, and Mr Narayanan is keen to see the results. \"I want people who fabricated this case against me to be punished,\" he says. \"One chapter is over, but the next chapter is still there.\"\nThe motive for the plot against him and the five others remains a mystery. \nWas it a conspiracy by a rival space power - as Mr Narayanan suspects - to scuttle India's development of cryogenic rocket technology, which eventually became the backbone of the country's successes in space? Did it have to do with rivals who were nervous about India forcing its way into the commercial satellite launch market with competitive prices? Or was it purely a product of corruption with India itself?\n\"It was born out of one conspiracy. But the conspirators were different with different motives, and the victims were the same set of people,\" says Mr Narayanan.\n\"Whatever it is, my career, honour, dignity and happiness were lost. And the people who were responsible for this are still scot free.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nCan you guide a spacecraft into orbit around Mars and cook for eight people morning and night?

But just how green are your fingers? \nFrom cutting down on \"plant miles\" to reusing plastic pots, British gardeners, botanists and environmental campaigners have shared ways to keep your horticultural hobby sustainable.\nHouseplants are on the rise, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says average sales in the second half of last year were up 60% on the previous year. \nThe trend has been attributed to eco-friendly, health-conscious millennials who want to bring the great outdoors into their inner-city flats and nurture something \"real\" in an increasingly virtual world.\nAbout four in five 16 to 24-year-olds own at least one houseplant and a fifth of owners bought them to boost their health and wellbeing, a RHS survey suggests.\nIf they can get some good photos along the way, even better. The hashtag #plantsofinstagram has been used more than 4 million times.  \nWith the craze has sprung up a number of specialist online retailers that deliver straight to your door.\nPatch, which says it is London's biggest online plant retailer, is one example. It gives its plants nicknames like \"Chaz\" and \"Big Ken\" to endear them to prospective \"plant parents\".\nChief executive Freddie Blackett says that part of the appeal is that plants make people feel \"calmer, happier and more at ease\".\nPatch's plants are grown in the Netherlands and shipped to the UK as and when they are ordered, which avoids excess plants being shipped.\nBut ordering online could rack up \"plant miles\", says Fay Kenworthy, co-founder of PlantSwap, a Sheffield-based community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally.\n\"As many plants are brought in from overseas, their transportation represents a significant ecological footprint,\" she says, noting that while most come from Holland, orchids can be shipped from Indonesia and \"light-loving\" plants from Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\"You may have decided to reduce your international travel to protect the environment but your plants are still shipping across the world.\"\nShipping from abroad isn't too much of a concern for botanist and BBC presenter James Wong, the proud owner of 500 houseplants.\n\"You're going to be [ordering plants] on a much smaller scale compared to outdoors, so, by definition, it's going to have a lower carbon footprint,\" he says.\nHe argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car, and that \nHe adds that growing certain plants in hotter climates and shipping them to the UK can eliminate the need for heated greenhouses closer to home. \nHowever, Wong agrees that exchanging unwanted plants, cuttings, and seedlings at plant swaps is a sustainable option for houseplant buyers.\nAnother benefit, according to Ms Kenworthy, is that it avoids the excess packaging that comes with new plants - including plastic pots.\nPots can be a \"nightmare\" to recycle, says anti-plastic campaigner Amy Meek, 16.\nOnly about 10% of local authorities in the UK accept them, according to analysts at the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). \nSometimes they are not collected because they are considered contaminated. But many are also made from black plastic, which often cannot be detected by sorting machines at recycling centres, and so end up in landfill or incinerated.\nMany local authorities reject even non-black plastic pots, which has led to the development of more easily-recyclable many UK buyers live closer to Amsterdam than British-based suppliers. and even biodegradable pots.\nThe Horticultural Trades Association and RHS Gardens offer plant pot recycling or \"take back\" schemes, and B&Q says it is trialling a recycling scheme.\nMiss Meek, who runs environmental charity Kids Against Plastic with her younger sister, Ella, wants buyers to think about plants' packaging.\nShe encourages people to ask: \"Will I be able to  I use it again, or is there somewhere else I could look to buy these plants from that are using more sustainable packaging or one that could be used for longer?\"\nBut being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered  - it is also about what it is grown in. \nThe main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts. \nThe earthy substance, found in waterlogged areas in the UK, is made of decomposed plant matter and can take thousands of years to form. \n\"Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year,\" says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife.\nHe encourages people to check with retailers about the use of peat, or to stick to plants that don't need it, like orchids or cacti.\nBecause plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air.\nPhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove \"significant amounts\" of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil.\n\"The amount the plant is watered affects its ability to function and remove CO2, in the same way as with people - if you're dehydrated or have drunk too much water you will not function as well,\" he says.\nDracaena \"Golden Coast\" plants and peace lillies performed best in his research, but he says you'd still need to buy a lot of them - even installing a vertical garden or \"green wall\" - and have extra lighting in order for them to reduce CO2 levels.\nSo, are houseplants bad for the environment?\nWong says that everything we do has a carbon footprint and that, in the scheme of things, people shouldn't \"freak out\" about their environmental impact.\nHowever, he advises that if buyers want to be as sustainable as possible, they should talk to their suppliers about the use of peat, avoid buying houseplants that are \"designed to die\" like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti, and propagate plants from cuttings and seeds to offset any environmental concerns.\n\"Not that those things are a huge issue,\" he says. \"But every little bit helps.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51361582": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51361582", "title": "'A turtle inspired us to tackle plastic pollution'", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 06:39:51 GMT", "summary": "A couple who met while travelling say seeing the \"scary\" impact of rubbish spurred them into action.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-51357526": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-51357526", "title": "Portsmouth academic develops 'perfect espresso' formula", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 23:57:37 GMT", "summary": "A team of mathematicians and physicists say they have the formula for consistently good coffee.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51371250": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51371250", "title": "O'Neill: PM 'doesn't really get' climate change", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 09:42:08 GMT", "summary": "Former minister Claire O'Neill has said the prime minister \"doesn't really get\" climate change.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368482": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368482", "title": "Sir David Attenborough: 'Now is the moment'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 11:12:34 GMT", "summary": "The broadcaster and naturalist says the Glasgow climate summit later this year is \"extremely important\".", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368483": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368483", "title": "Boris Johnson: 'Global warming is taking its toll'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 11:36:23 GMT", "summary": "The prime minister says climate change is harming \"the most vulnerable populations around the planet\".", "story": ""}}, "technology": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51413724": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51413724", "title": "Apple fined for slowing down old iPhones", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:49:07 GMT", "summary": "Apple agrees to pay a \u00a321m fine in France for not making it clear that it slowed down old iPhones.", "story": "Apple has been fined 25 million euros (\u00a321m, $27m) for deliberately slowing down older iPhone models without making it clear to consumers.\nThe fine was imposed by France's competition and fraud watchdog DGCCRF, which said consumers were not warned.\nIn 2017, Apple confirmed that it did slow down some iPhones, but said it only did so to \"prolong the life\" of the devices.\nApple said in a statement that it had resolved the issue with the watchdog.\nMany customers had long suspected that Apple slowed down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade when a new one was released.\nIn 2017, the company confirmed it did slow down some models as they aged, but not to encourage people to upgrade.\nIt said the lithium-ion batteries in the devices became less capable of supplying peak current demands, as they aged over time.\nThat could result in an iPhone unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.\nSo, it released a software update for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE which \"smoothed out\" battery performance.\nThe practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged, but had suddenly speeded up again after the battery had been replaced.\nThe French watchdog said iPhone owners \"were not informed that installing iOS updates (10.2.1 and 11.2) could slow down their devices\".\nAs part of the agreement, Apple must display a notice on its French-language website for a month.\nIt says Apple \"committed the crime of deceptive commercial practice by omission\" and had agreed to pay the fine.\nYes.

Not because he is past his prime, but because - he alleges - he's been \"shadow banned\" for uploading videos on Hindu-Muslim brotherhood on the popular video creation and sharing platform. \nShadow banning is the act of partially blocking content so it doesn't reach the platform's entire community of users. It will not be obvious to the user that the creator's content is not being promoted. \nTikTok has traditionally shied away from political subjects, but Mr Barman built a strong following of just under a million by performing and uploading 15 second skits on the theme of Hindu-Muslim unity at a time when many in India fear the two communities are being driven further apart. His most popular offering garnered more than 2.5 million views.\nIn one of the videos, Mr Barman is dressed as a Muslim man wearing a white prayer cap who is being carried by a Hindu man as harmonious music plays in the background. In another popular skit, he is dressed as a Muslim writer from Pakistan who is in India to research a book and is greeted and hosted by two gleeful Hindu strangers.\nThe fact that a young Hindu man from the Indian city of Bhopal was uploading videos promoting brotherhood and peace between Hindus and Muslims captured significant attention, earning him the moniker of top \"humanity\" content creator.\nBut over the past four months, TikTok India has been restricting the reach of his account to stay away from such \"risky\" content, he says, adding that he has lost some 25,000 followers since the end of October.  \nIn particular, his videos were no longer suggested on the front page, where TikTok gives tailored recommendations of creators and hashtags for users to discover. \n\"My videos used to get an average of 200,000 views but it's now down to 8,000 views. None of my videos show up on the 'For You' page,\" Mr Barman says.\nHe says his account started losing prominence last year, around the time a backlash began against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) - a controversial law which offers Indian citizenship to non-Muslims fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\nThe law sparked fears it would marginalise India's Muslim minority, triggering protests. In the past few months, many of TikTok's 200 million Indian users have posted skits and songs on the app to voice their own opposition. \nThousands of these profess \"unity\" between people of different faiths under an umbrella of hashtags around the CAA, and have gathered millions of views. \nBut many are now worried after Mr Barman alleged he was shadow-banned. They wonder if they may be next. \n\"I was inspired by many of Mr Barman's videos that talk about brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims,\" said Mirza Ateeque Baig, a 16-year-old user.\nMirza shot to fame with a video viewed more than 4.8 million times, positioning politicians as the culprits dividing communities amid the backdrop of the citizenship law protests. \nHe says he was \"scared\" to upload it at first. \"I thought about it for 15 minutes. They [TikTok] don't want anything political that will impact them.\"\nTikTok India said it does not restrict any political content unless it violates its community guidelines. \nWhile the app does ban accounts for serious violations like pornography or hate speech, content it sees as a \"lesser infringement\" of its guidelines is left up on the app - but partially limited across user feeds.\nThis kind of \"limiting\" or shadow banning leaves creators in a bind - they are unsure if their content is being censored for violating guidelines, or whether it was simply not good enough to be promoted.\nBut then, users point to other evidence of people being blocked or \"shadow banned\" for political reasons by the app.\nIn the past few months the social media platform, owned by China's ByteDance, has been called out for allegedly censoring so-called \"risky\" content. Most recently, it faced massive backlash in the US for blocking a teenager's account after she uploaded a video accusing China of putting Muslims into \"concentration camps\".  TikTok later issued an apology and reinstated her account.  \nMeanwhile, a recent report in The Guardian revealed that Bytedance had policies in place that outright censored \"politically sensitive\" content relating to US President Donald Trump and criticism of China's socialist system. \nIn Turkey, the company was found to be censoring content that showed the LGBT community or same-sex relationships in a positive light. It has since updated its policies. \nHowever, TikTok has reason to be cautious in India. Police bought a case against unidentified TikTok influencers for hate speech over a video that sought revenge for a victim of mob lynching, and the app was temporarily banned in the country last year when a court decided it was encouraging pornography. \nTiktok told the BBC it had temporarily suspended Mr Barman's account because he was seen wearing a t-shirt with a drug reference in several of his videos. \"This should not have been a violation, and we have reinstated the videos accordingly,\" the company added.\n\"Our guidelines are clear that political content is allowed on TikTok, as long as it does not include extremist content, such as hate speech,\" a TikTok spokesperson said. \"All users have the opportunity to appeal violations, which the user had not done in this case.\" \nThe company, however, did not respond to Mr Barman's allegation that he had been \"shadow banned\".\nFor Mr Barman, the timing remains troubling. \"Since the censoring, I have made most of my Hindu-Muslim humanity videos private, hoping that TikTok will reverse the shadow ban.\" He has even abandoned his first account and started afresh, uploading only comedy content that steers clear of his usual themes.\nMr Barman's fans, meanwhile, have started an online campaign to reinstate his account, using the hashtag \"unfreeze\". They have made more than 700 videos.\nFree speech activists have also raised questions over the practice of shadow banning content on TikTok. \n\"They will have to be transparent about to what extent and technical ability they are boosting, de-prioritising and changing the ecology of experience for users and creators on the app,\" said Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.\nHe also pointed to the larger problem of censorship being algorithm-driven. In most cases, apps like TikTok tweak the platform in a way that matches their commercial interest over any interest in free expression, Mr Gupta added. \n\"We also now have a platform which has the communitarian ethos of China, which is risk averse to almost any kind of political commentary. TikTok doesn't recognise that in the territories it operates, politics is an everyday conversation.\" \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51304268": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51304268", "title": "Eating disorder used to sell diets on Instagram", "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 22:38:33 GMT", "summary": "Kara Henry explains how Instagram accounts are using images of her eating disorder to promote weight loss.", "story": "Instagram accounts are using images of a person recovering from an eating disorder to advertise weight loss.\nThe BBC has seen more than 30 accounts using the photos and some of them have more than a million followers.\nThe photos were taken by Kara Henry to document her journey of recovery from an eating disorder when she weighed just over four stone.\nHer images have been uploaded without her permission alongside claims that this shows successful weight loss.\nVisitors to the accounts using Ms Henry's images are urged to \"click the link in the bio\" to buy a tailored weight loss or diet plan to help achieve the results shown in the picture.\nInstagram has not responded to a request for comment.\nMs Henry told the BBC she estimates the images have been uploaded almost 100 times over the past three months, yet she was not able to get them removed.\n\"It's completely out of my control,\" she said. \"It's a picture of me being used completely out of context and inappropriately.\n\"It's being published to make it look like I'm going from a healthy weight to 60 pounds, with a message advertising a diet plan.

It was something I knew that I had to do. I don't know what the world will be like now.

With the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay. \n\"This is something that has caused many heart-breaking conversations at home. I have been married to Steph for nearly 27 years, and we have two beautiful grown-up daughters, Molly and Ruby. My family have held me so close - they have tried to cheer me up, to smother me with kindness and love, despite their own confusion. Yet still I can't sleep and there have been some very dark moments.\n\"My inner conflict contrasts with an outside world that has changed so very much for the better. Today, quite rightly, being gay is a reason to celebrate and be proud. Yes, I am feeling pain and confusion, but that comes only from the hurt that I am causing to my family. \n\"Steph has been incredible - I love her so very much. She is the kindest soul I have ever met. My girls have been astonishing in their love, hugs and encouraging words of comfort. Both my and Steph's entire families have stunned me with their love, instant acceptance and support. \n\"Of course they are worried about Steph, but I know they will scoop us both up. My friends are the best, especially Holly, who has been so kind and wise - and who has hugged me as I sobbed on her shoulder. At ITV, I couldn't hope to work with more wonderful, supportive teams.\n\"Every day on This Morning, I sit in awe of those we meet who have been brave and open in confronting their truth - so now it's my turn to share mine. This will probably all come as something of a surprise and I understand, but only by facing this, by being honest, can I hope to find peace in my mind and a way forward.\n\"Please be kind, especially to my family.\"\nSocial media was filled with support for Schofield after his announcement on Friday morning.\nThe BBC's Victoria Derbyshire added: \"So much love for Schofe for his open, honest, dignified statement.\"\nDancing on Ice star Ian H Watkins, who recently made history by dancing with his same-sex partner on the show, welcomed Schofield to \"our beautiful rainbow family!\"Richard Osman of BBC One's Pointless said: \"When you create a new entertainment show and start discussing who should host, the first name on the list is always Phillip Schofield. That's a fact. \n\"He's just the very best at what he does, and the public adore him. Looking forward to many more years of his charm and brilliance.\"\nSchofield found fame on children's TV in the 1980s alongside Gordon the Gopher in the BBC's Broom Cupboard, and on Saturday morning show Going Live!\nHe has starred in the West End in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Doctor Dolittle, and fronted TV game shows like Talking Telephone Numbers and Schofield's Quest before joining This Morning in 2002.\nThe programme has won at the National Television Awards for 10 years in a row, including the prize for best live magazine show at last month's ceremony. \nSchofield also presents a programme with his wife every December where they review Christmas gifts.\nEntertainment reporter Caroline Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live that stars from the previous generation were likely have been told in the past that coming out as gay could damage their careers.\n\"You see all these young stars coming through and they don't have to think about it,\" she said. \"They're fluid. They just define their own terms.\n\"But a lot of those older entertainers are having to play catch-up. They branded themselves and were probably advised 'Don't come out because it will ruin your following'.\n\"So they are having to catch-up and climb back up the hill of enjoying the same privileges that have come very naturally to that new generation.\"\n\"Coming out\" is a moment which unites all LGBT people, whether they are eventually able to do it, or not. Some never will.  \nSocial media reactions show that this is being seen as an incredibly brave decision for Philip Schofield to make. Whilst Schofield is seen as a national treasure, and someone trusted with hearing deep and personal experiences on a daily basis, for him to become the story is wholly different. \nWhen someone with such a massive public platform comes out as LGBT, their entire life in the public eye is suddenly questioned, with some on-lookers inevitably claiming they \"knew all along\". In many cases, the person coming out may not have even known, let alone their family and friends. \nLGBT acceptance in the UK has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Whilst there are still issues, on the whole, people are much more free to be themselves than ever before. As a result, national LGBT charities such as the LGBT Foundation now offer tailored 'coming out' guidance to the growing numbers of LGBT people who are choosing to come out later in life, helping them navigate any barriers they may face.\nThis huge moment for Phillip Schofield may just be the green light that others need to come out themselves. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51419590": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51419590", "title": "The teenager who drew Billie Eilish for Vogue", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:30:06 GMT", "summary": "The Grammy-winner is officially a fan of 16-year-old Russian schoolgirl Anastasia Kovtun.", "story": "A portrait of Billie Eilish drawn by an aspiring Russian teenage artist is featured on one of four covers of the March edition of digital Vogue.\nAnastasia Kovtun, a 16-year old from a small town in the Urals, some 900 miles east of Moscow, was overwhelmed when the magazine contacted her to tell her that the singer herself picked out one of her drawings.\nAnastasia, or Nastya, who had showcased her art on social media, has spent three years at a drawing school but felt out of place there and eventually stopped going. She says she wanted to stay true to herself and did not want to transform her artistic style under pressure from instructors. \nThe Russian teenager is one of two lucky fans whose art was personally selected by Grammy-award-winning singer. The 16-year-old and Kylie Young, 20, from Michigan, both thought it was a practical joke when Vogue called. The former asked for proof - and so the magazine sent her a detailed description of the forthcoming edition, translated into Russian.\nNastya spoke to BBC Russian correspondent Maria Kornienko from the town of Chaykovsky (named after the great Russian classical music composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky) and explained she is a fan of Eilish because of her quirky, colourful and unique style.  \nShe says a phone call from Vogue was a surprise because she had not been on Instagram for long. \n\"I only opened an account in October last year. I know I am not a well-known or a recognised artist,\" she said. But she also knew that Billie Eilish had spotted her work.\n\"She liked two of my drawings in November,\" says Nastya. \"I was very inspired by that, Billie was the first famous person to express her opinion about my work. She noticed me.\"\nStill, that did not prepare Nastya for having her work on a Vogue cover.\nShe has had to go off social media for a few days after the cover was revealed as she could not cope with the avalanche of messages from people trying to reach her. \n\"Over the past few days my life has changed a lot. I have had some very interesting and tempting offers and I know it is an opportunity for me to realise myself as an artist. Still, I have to consider everything carefully. I don't want to abandon school, for instance.\n\"I was given an extraordinary opportunity to share my art and I will use it. It won't be easy but it will be worth it.\"\nBut what about the reaction on social media after she went back online?\n\"I try not to read comments where people say strange things,\" she explained. \"Such as that my drawing is only average. \n\"They think it is only luck that I was noticed for but I had worked so hard!

For that reason, like Billie herself, she admires Lana Del Rey and Miley Cyrus.\nShe also respects Russian artists who stick with their style and aren't just trying to earn money and fame.\n\"Art is not about catching the hype or getting rich.

At every point, Kesha has either dropped her claims or lost in court, where matters of assault are difficult to prove. \nThursday's ruling (which you can read online) was another setback, with judge Schecter dismissing a number of Kesha's defence arguments.\nMost importantly, she made it easier for Gottwald's laywers to prove defamation by ruling that the producer was not a public figure or household name at the time of Kesha's allegations becoming public.\nIndividuals who are less well-known to the general public only have to prove that the defendant caused harm by making false claims, whereas public figures need to provide evidence of \"actual malice\" or \"gross irresponsibility\".\nThe judge made it clear she was not ruling on the factual question of whether Gottwald raped Kesha, saying that decision would be left to a jury.\nA jury will also have to decide whether the accusations made in Kesha's original court case were made \"in good faith of or as a sham to defame Gottwald and obtain business leverage\".\nHowever, the court also ruled that Gottwald had already \"met the heavy burden\" of establishing defamation in one specific instance - Kesha's 2016 text message to Lady Gaga, in which she said Katy Perry had been \"raped by the same man\".\n\"Perry unequivocally testified that Gottwald did not do so,\" wrote judge Schecter. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that Gottwald raped Katy Perry or that Katy Perry, whose sworn testimony is unrefuted, must not be believed.\"\nIn addition, the court dismissed Kesha's claim that her contract with Dr Luke's record label, Kemosabe, was unconscionable and fraudulent.\nKesha's new legal team responded to the judge's decisions by saying, \"We disagree with the Court's rulings. We plan to immediately appeal\".\nGottwald's lawyer said her client was looking forward to clearing his name at trial.\n\"Kesha abandoned her meritless case against Dr Luke more than three years ago,\" said Christine Lepera in a statement. \n\"The only remaining lawsuit is Dr Luke's case against Kesha for defamation and breach of contract. Dr Luke is pursuing this lawsuit to seek recovery for the serious harm Kesha's false accusations of rape have caused Dr Luke, his family and his business.\n\"Dr Luke looks forward to the trial of his case where he will prove that Kesha's other false statements about him were equally false and defamatory,\" she concluded.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51406557": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51406557", "title": "Joaquin Phoenix's unusual Oscar campaign", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:08:21 GMT", "summary": "The Joker actor's Oscar campaign has been political - using awards season to campaign for various causes.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51403625": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51403625", "title": "Unseen Charles Dickens letters open window into the life of a genius", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 11:00:29 GMT", "summary": "He was compelled to write and write, even on holiday, but still found time to correspond with a fan.", "story": "Letters by Charles Dickens, revealing his state of mind while working on novels including A Christmas Carol, are to go on display for the first time.\nIn one, he discloses: \"I have been writing my head off since ten o'clock...\" despite being on holiday.   \nThe 25 unpublished letters are part of a huge collection of manuscripts, books from his library and personal items.\nThey have been acquired by the Charles Dickens Museum in London and will go on display later in the year. \nThe acquisition is being announced to mark the writer's birthday on Friday. \nWhile he was writing A Christmas Carol, Dickens sent a letter dated 9 November 1843 to a close friend.\n\"I have half done the Christmas Book, and am resting for two days before going to Chuzzlewit [Martin Chuzzlewit, his sixth novel] - that is, if I can call anything rest, with that before me. \n\"Yesterday I walked a great deal.

The slew of other awards ceremonies over several months was thought to be damaging interest in the Oscars, which mark the conclusion of awards season.\nOscar-ologists have been closely studying the nominations list for trends, patterns, quirks and clues about who might win what.\nShe is only the 12th person to receive two acting nominations in the same year.\nJohansson is nominated for both best actress and best supporting actress for her performances in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit respectively.\nThe other 11 people who've been nominated twice in acting categories at the same Oscars ceremony include Sigourney Weaver (in 1989), Al Pacino (1993), Emma Thompson (1994), Jamie Foxx (2005) and, most recently, Cate Blanchett (2008).\nBut none has ever won in both their categories.\nVery rarely does the winner of best actress also star in the winner of best picture - the last one who did was Hilary Swank in 2004's Million Dollar Baby.\nThat's unlikely to change this year.\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger is the favourite to win best actress for Judy, which isn't even his multi-use tux. for best picture.\nIn fact, if the Harriet star wins an Oscar to go with her Emmy, Grammy and Tony awards she'll become the youngest EGOT winner in history.\nThe 33-year-old would take over from the current record holder Robert Lopez, who completed the quad in 2018 at the age of 39.\nErivo has two chances to do this on Oscars night - because she's nominated for both best actress and best original song (she co-wrote Harriet's anthemic original song Stand Up.)\nThe newly-knighted Sir Sam first won in 2000 for American Beauty, but could triumph again at the 2020 ceremony with his hugely successful World War One epic 1917.\nBefore now, Billy Wilder recorded the biggest gap, winning his two best director trophies 15 years apart for The Lost Weekend (1945) and The Apartment (1960).\nDirectors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, who began dating in 2011 and have a child together, are up against each other for the top prize.\nGerwig's nomination for Little Women and Baumbach's for Marriage Story make them the first director-couple to go head-to-head for best picture.\nThis almost happened in 2009, when James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow both had films nominated - but they had divorced some 18 years earlier.\nGerwig and Baumbach are nominated in slightly different categories for writing (best adapted screenplay and original screenplay respectively), so at least that slightly eases the tension over the dishwasher.\nCoincidentally, both their films star Laura Dern, who is nominated for best supporting actress.\nThat's partly because it's unusual for a film to win best picture without a nomination for best director, which neither Gerwig nor Baumbach have.\nIt's not impossible, however. \nLast year, Green Book triumphed without a director nod for Peter Farrelly. Prior to that, 2013's Argo was the last to win without a nomination for its director Ben Affleck.\nThe prize for best animated feature was introduced in 2001, and since then only one sequel - Toy Story 3 - has won.\nSo a victory for Toy Story 4 would make it not just the second sequel to win best animated feature, but the second to win within its own film series. \nIt's the first Korean film to receive a best picture nomination, and only the sixth film to be nominated for both best picture and international feature film.\nThat list of previous double nominees includes last year's Roma, 2012's Amour and 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nThe Two Popes star is the only nominee in the category who plays a real-life figure - Pope Francis. \nThe others, Leonardo DiCaprio, Antonio Banderas, Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix, all portray fictional characters.wove some of his own experiences(Admittedly, Pedro Almod\u00f3var a 1998 feature in Esquire magazine into the film director character played by Banderas in Pain & Glory.)\nThere's more reality in the best actress category - Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays Judy Garland, Cynthia Erivo portrays anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman and Charlize Theron plays Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.\nTwo of this year's awards season hopefuls were based on single magazine articles. \nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood was inspired by a 2015 investigation in New York magazine by journalist Tom Junod, who wrote a profile interview with the children's entertainer Fred Rogers.\nHustlers, meanwhile, was based on which is 49 by Jessica Pressler.\nDespite both films being nominated across awards season, including at the Golden Globes, sadly only Beautiful Day registered on the Academy's radar. \nJennifer Lopez will have to rely on a future film to score her first Oscar nomination.\nThat's considerably older this year than the average age of all previous winners in this category - shot in one continuous take.\nThis time around, Brad Pitt is the youngest at 56, nominated alongside Tom Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (82).\nHaving been around a while, it's perhaps unsurprising that all five of these greedy guts already have an Oscar - Pitt's came as a producer on 12 Years A Slave while the others won for acting.\nOscar pundits keep a close eye on best film editing every year, because there's a strong correlation between being nominated in this category and ultimately winning best picture. \nIt's notable, therefore, that 1917's momentum for the top prize comes despite the lack of an editing nomination.\nOnly one film since 1980 has won best picture without a best film editing nod, which was 2014's Birdman.\nInterestingly, Birdman and 1917 already share something in common - both films appear to have been acknowledged Christopher Smith of Motor1,. Neither actually were, which, ironically, shows how skilful the editing must have been.\nThis might not sound particularly interesting, but there's a surprisingly large number of racing films which have missed out in the past - such as Rush, Grand Prix and Days of Thunder.\nSenna wouldn't have been eligible for best picture as it would have been in for best documentary, but it wasn't even nominated for that.\nFord v Ferrari (which is titled Le Mans '66 in some countries) is nominated but is highly unlikely to win.\n\"It faces tough competition,\" as we said last year \"but beating tough competition is what the movie is all about.\"\nThe streaming service pinned all its hopes (and money) on Roma in 2019, campaigning hard for the best picture win which eventually went to Green Book.\nThey fielded far more films for awards season this year, such as The King, Dolemite Is My Name, The Two Popes and The Laundromat (a film about which the less said the better).\nHowever, two of their films in particular, The Irishman and Marriage Story, are nominated for the top prize.\nIt may well be that the Academy is still not ready to allow a streaming service to win best picture. But if any Netflix title can win them over, you'd think it'd be a Martin Scorsese gangster film starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.\nThis may be down to Parasite being perceived as a film with an ensemble cast, where no performance is easily singled out for a leading actor category. \nThe absence of 1917 in the acting categories is perhaps more surprising as George MacKay appears in the entire film.\nHer others include LeAnn Rimes's How Do I Live (from Con Air), Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (from Armageddon) and Faith Hill's There You'll Be (from Pearl Harbor).\nBut, most Oscar-nominated woman without a win, she has still never actually won.\nIn fact, she is now the Facebook in history, which keeps the heat off Glenn Close a little longer.\nSir Elton John's nomination in this category comes 25 years after he won it for Can You Feel The Love Tonight? from The Lion King.\nShe was widely expected to win for 1954's A Star is Born, and even had cameras set up around her hospital bed (she had just given birth) to capture her speech. \nGrace Kelly won instead for The Country Girl - one of the biggest upsets in Oscars history. \nThe cameramen rapidly dismounted the equipment around Garland and left.\nSo if Ren\u00e9e Zellweger does win best actress, at least that will indirectly mark some form of (late) Academy recognition for Garland, more than five decades after she died.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51378961": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51378961", "title": "Cynthia Erivo: 'Hopefully this year will be a turning point'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:25:09 GMT", "summary": "Cynthia Erivo is the only person of colour nominated for an acting Oscar this year.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51107986": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51107986", "title": "Oscars 2020: 'How my cello became Joaquin Phoenix's Joker'", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 16:19:24 GMT", "summary": "Oscar-nominated Icelandic composer Hildur Gudnadottir on how her music inspired the film's star.", "story": "Stringed instruments have long been used to make people feel edgy. \nThink of a double bass rasping \"duh-nuh, duh-nuh\" as Jaws approaches, or the screeching violins of Psycho as terror strikes. \nThere's something visceral about their sound, which can make your hair stand on end during a horrifying film sequence.\nIn Joker, the cello conveys the inner turmoil of Joaquin Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck, as he contorts into a murderous clown. \nThe film's soundtrack is the work of Icelandic composer and cellist Hildur Gudnadottir - the only woman nominated for best score at this year's Oscars. \nAnyone who's seen the film will know the music plays an integral part. \n\"Joker is the story of basically one person, so it felt fitting that one instrument was leading the way into his head, leading us forward,\" she tells BBC News.\nOf all the instruments at her disposal, she chose the cello. \"It's my instrument, so it was convenient as I played it on the soundtrack,\" she says.\nHildur was lured into working on the Joker origin film by director Todd Phillips, and she recalls: \"The script was just fantastic - it struck me very hard.\"\nShe collaborated on Arthur's transformation into Joker with Phillips and Phoenix, the favourite to win best actor at the Oscars.\n\"I fell in love with the film and wrote all the main themes before they started shooting, so they were able to use that music, and I was able to be a part of that.\" \nEnd of Youtube post  by WaterTower Music\nHildur's music was pivotal to a key early scene in the film - the \"bathroom dance\" where Arthur, dressed as Joker, begins to inhabit his alter ego. \nHer score triggered an unexpected response in Phoenix. \nIn the half-light of a bathroom, he slowly twists his arms in a series of oddly balletic poses as a haunting cello solo plays.

My personality is rather cheerful, I like to laugh, but every person has a dark side and a light side, and luckily for my family, my lighter side is the main side and the darker side is in my music.\"\nWith a female composer, Joker is helping carve new ground for films inspired by comic books and super-heroes. \nCaptain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, also has a female composer.

And if they did keep working under pseudonyms, they had to do so at very cheap rates. \nIn his 2012 memoir I Am Spartacus!: Making A Film, Breaking The Blacklist, Douglas wrote about hiring Trumbo, who planned to rewrite the script under the name Sam Jackson.\n\"I gave my new friend 'Sam' a copy of the book and he promised to read it right away,\" Douglas said. \"I had been thinking a lot about the day when the blacklist would end.\"\nIt became widely known in Hollywood that Trumbo had written Spartacus. A gossip columnist, Walter Winchell, ran an item in March 1959 outing him as the screenwriter.\nThat perhaps paved the way for what Douglas did next.\nDouglas said he told Trumbo that once the film was finished, \"not only am I going to tell them that you've written it, but we're putting your name on it\".\nIn August 1960, the studio Universal-International announced that the writer would receive a full screen credit as Dalton Trumbo.\nThe blacklist was effectively broken.\n\"The masquerade was over,\" Douglas later wrote. \"All my friends told me I was being stupid, throwing my career away. It was a tremendous risk. But the blacklist was broken.\n\"I wasn't thinking of being a hero and breaking the blacklist. It wasn't until later I realised the significance of that impulsive gesture.\"\nIn fact, Douglas claimed to have first broken the blacklist nine months earlier by requesting that Universal Studios issue a parking pass for Trumbo - which was significant because it was issued under the writer's real name. \nEither way, Rebecca Keegan, senior film editor at the Hollywood Reporter, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Douglas's actions were \"pretty extraordinary\". \n\"It was a radical thing to do at the time, it was a huge statement,\" she said. \"Douglas put his real name in the credits. It was one of the most significant acts in ending the use of the blacklist, which had had such an oppressive effect in Hollywood.\"\nKeegan says Douglas used his star power to make sure Trumbo got the credit he deserved.\n\"The fact that Hollywood was using these blacklisted screenwriters, paying them pennies on the dollar, and not allowing them to use their real names, he thought that was absurd,\" she explained.\n\"And he had enough power at that point that he could make a decision like that and have a profound impact on the industry.\"\nLater in his career, Douglas revelled in telling people how he had broken the blacklist.\nBut some have argued that he overstated the part he played.\nTrumbo's daughter, Melissa, said that when his 2012 book was published, she \"threw it across the room\". \nIn 2002, Trumbo's widow Cleo wrote a letter to the LA Times saying \"no single person can be credited with breaking the blacklist\".\nNonetheless, Douglas became the public face of the blacklist rebellion, which would have taken some courage in itself, even if just as one member of a growing movement.\nSpeaking to the Jewish Chronicle in 2012, Douglas said: \"I have been working in Hollywood over 60 years and I've made over 85 pictures, but the thing I'm most proud of is breaking the blacklist.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-51374861": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-51374861", "title": "Silent Witness star Liz Carr set for Hollywood film role", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 22:00:02 GMT", "summary": "The star says she is to appear in her first major movie after leaving the crime drama on a high.", "story": "Silent Witness star Liz Carr says she has left the programme on a high after her \"best series ever\" - and is set to appear in her first Hollywood film.\nThe actress, who has played forensic examiner Clarissa Mullery since 2012, bowed out this week at the end of the 23rd season of the hit BBC crime drama.\nShe revealed on the BBC Ouch podcast that she will be seen in her first major movie - the sci-fi drama Infinite - later this year, alongside Mark Wahlberg. \nCarr who uses a wheelchair, says she is proud of how Silent Witness improved the representation of disabled people on screen, although it had not always been easy.\nShe says the BBC seemed \"terrified\" about what to do with a disabled actor in primetime drama when she first started, but she made sure her voice was heard.  \n\"I think over the eight years I've kind of policed the show quite a lot and worked to make sure it was better and refused to say certain lines that I thought were problematic.\n\"I was asked recently if I was proud of what we achieved in terms of representation in Silent Witness - Oh, my goodness, of course I am.\"\nPrior to Silent Witness, Carr was probably best known as a comedian, disabled rights activist and presenter of the BBC Ouch podcast.\nBut her continuing role as Clarissa has made her one of the most high-profile disabled actors in Britain.\nCarr says she first indicated she wanted to leave Silent Witness back in October 2018.\n\"It must seem like a ridiculous decision\", she says. \"But I was just doing the same thing [in terms of storyline] and, as an actor, that just wasn't that interesting.\"\nShe says the \"irony\" was that having made the decision to leave, a new producer was brought in who promised her \"the most challenging series that you've ever had\" and \"he's delivered,\" she said.\nIn the latest series, Carr was at the centre of a storyline in which her character, Clarissa, had to make heart-breaking decisions about the care of her mother who had dementia and terminal cancer.\nCarr praised writer Lena Rae, whose two-parter called Hope was her Silent Witness debut. \n\"There's a lot of stuff there that we've not seen before. I think about that relationship of an aging parent with a disabled child. But equally, seeing a disabled woman as the carer,\" Carr says. \n\"It was everything about disability and it was nothing about disability. And it connected us in a way that said: 'We all experience this'. We're all going to lose parents or somebody that we love.\"\nCarr says she was especially touched by the audience reaction to her portrayal of the storyline with many saying they could \"relate\" to Clarissa's predicament. \nThe actress' own father died last year, shortly before she filmed her final episodes, and her performance in Hope drew heavily on that experience.\n\"I'm not sure that I was acting,\" she says. \"I think I was almost re-enacting and reliving being at my dad's bedside when he died. He died in hospital. He had Parkinson's and vascular dementia.\" \nLike her onscreen character, who has just resigned as a forensic examiner, so Carr felt the need for a change in her own life - \"I just want to go out there and take a leap of faith\".\nThat leap has landed her in Hollywood blockbuster, Infinite, alongside A-listers Wahlberg and Chiwetel Ejiofor.\nThe summer release has been directed by Antoine Fuqua whose other films include Training Day and the Equalizer movies. \n\"It's a great role. I'm ecstatic,\" Carr says after admitting she was surprised to get the part.\n\"I thought, I bet they're just going to audition wheelchair-users and then they're going to give the role to Tom Cruise.\"\nHowever, heady dreams that she would have to relocate to Hollywood were somewhat thwarted when she discovered filming would take place in west London.\nBut she is certain playing a major character in a successful BBC drama convinced the casting team she had the requisite experience for the, currently secret, role.\n\"I've gone and had the most incredible opportunity to develop and get better and learn and learn and learn. And there are very few disabled actors internationally who have that experience.\"\nShe says she hopes her success will encourage TV and film makers to give other disabled actors \"a break\".\n\"Unless you can show how good you are, people aren't going to see what amazing talent is out there.\"\nIn December, the BBC announced a string of new shows with the aim of producing a more \"authentic and distinctive\" representation of disabled people on screen.\nCarr herself will perform one of a series of \"challenging\" monologues, curated by fellow, former BBC Ouch presenter Mat Fraser as part of that.\nShe's also set to return to our screens in an upcoming episode of Who Do You Think You Are? the BBC One show which delves into family history. \nCarr says this really took her out of her comfort zone.\n\"I don't really like surprises,\" she says.  \"So it's a difficult show to do.

Last summer, they played a homecoming show at Edgeley Park Stadium, selling out every ticket in under an hour.\nYet they've never so much as tickled the top 40.

The Top 40's an anomaly,\" says Ogden, arguing that hit singles aren't all they're cracked up to be.\n\"Charlemagne only got to number 98 but it's really well-known,\" he says. \n\"There are other artists who get loads of top 10 singles but their album only sneaks into the Top 20, like Liam Payne.

The Guardian revelled in its \"delightful\" and \"\n\" pop melodies. The NME called it \"\n\". And Clash magazine lapped up the \"\n\" similarities to acts like Abba, Fleetwood Mac and The Bee Gees.\nAs you can tell, Ogden was in a happy place when he started writing the album over Christmas 2018. He'd recently moved in with his girlfriend - the \"keeper\" of the song title - and started renovating their house. \nBecause the building was \"in bits\", he'd go back to his parents' house every time he had a spare moment to make music in the back room where he'd written Blossoms' first two albums. \nBut the situation was far from ideal. \"It wasn't like I could wake up and pick up a guitar,\" when inspiration struck, he recalls. \"I didn't even have a guitar in my house.\n\"So I was like, 'The first room we need to get done is my room to write tunes in - otherwise I can't really do my job.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by BBC Music\nOnce the work was done, Ogden bought an upright piano and wrote almost 25 songs, becoming so prolific that Blossoms initially considered releasing three mini-albums in 2020.\nInspired by three albums he'd been listening to during the renovation work (Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, U2's The Joshua Tree and Primal Scream's Screamadelica) his songs became more ambitious, both lyrically and musically.\nAs a result, you'll hear the band playing slide guitar with a bottle of insect repellent and bashing the hubcaps of a Subaru (\"it sounds like a triangle\"), while Ogden has started writing characters and stories instead of relying on his own life experiences.\nThat's most apparent on the single Your Girlfriend, a painfully realistic portrayal of a man who falls for his room-mate's girlfriend: \"marvellously uncool,\" he sighs wistfully in the chorus.\nHe found inspiration online after googling the phrase \"I love my friend's girlfriend\", and reading memorable and joyful. \nAfter that, \"it just started writing itself,\" says the singer.\nSome of the details from that blog seeped into the lyrics. The protagonist can't escape his friend's sex life because \"the walls are paper thin\"; and resolves to move out, only to find he \"can't 'cause we've just signed a lease\". \nOgden adds one final, fictional twist: \"I heard they got engaged today,\" he sings over the song's last chord.\nInitially, he wasn't sure about presenting it to the band - and not just because he worried they'd think it was written about one of glorious, ambitious and fulfillinggirlfriends.\n\"I remember you saying: 'I've done this and it's a bit weird,'\" Donovan reminds him. \"It's almost like you'd come up with the idea for a film.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by BlossomsVEVO\nDespite his reservations, the band were enthusiastic and encouraged him to finish the song. \n\"And the more we listened to it, we were like, 'Damn, it's great,\" says Ogden. Instead of holding it back and recording it in Nashville, as had been the plan, they jumped into the studio with long-term collaborator James Skelly from The Coral, and rushed the single out for last summer's festival season.\nThe reception encouraged them to ditch the Nashville sessions and build on Your Girlfriend's upbeat, rhythmic sound in the more familiar surroundings of Liverpool's Parr Street Studios. But as their confidence grew, they decided to keep portions of the demo recordings intact.\n\"The piano on The Keeper is the one from my room,\" says Ogden. \"Just an upright piano, not too fancy. \n\"We went into Parr Street Studios and they've got the grand piano that Chris Martin wrote The Scientist on, but it just didn't sound as good. \n\"So we were like, 'Put the one from the demo in,' and it just had something. \n\"That saved us an hour.\"\nAlthough Foolish Loving Spaces was only released six days ago, Ogden's purple patch continued and Blossoms are already working on their fourth album.\n\"Luckily, I've not hit a dry spot,\" says the singer. \"It'll happen one day, inevitably, but if you can get four albums out, then you can take a bit of a break, I reckon.\"\nNot that the band have any time off before the end of the year, with their first arena tour coming this spring, followed by a clutch of stadium dates supporting The Killers. \nOgden has even written a song, God-Sized Problem, with Brandon Flowers in mind, which could crop up on the next record. And even if it doesn't, says Donovan, they've got a \"killer tune\" held in reserve.\n\"It's one of the best songs we've ever done,\" he enthuses. \"And Tom wasn't even going to show it to us!\n\"If that dry patch ever comes around, I'm just going to rob his phone and scroll through the voice memos and be like, 'No a blog by someone facing that exact situationis a tune.'\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11009244": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11009244", "title": "Kirk Douglas: The remarkable life of a Hollywood great", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 23:45:05 GMT", "summary": "Kirk Douglas clawed his way up from poverty to become one of Hollywood's leading stars.", "story": "His only Oscar was an honorary award but Kirk Douglas became a Hollywood icon, with a film career spanning seven decades.\nHe prided himself on playing the tough guys, the sort of characters he once described as \"sons of bitches\".\nHe threw himself into his many roles with relish, acting with an intensity that often spilled over into his private life.\nAnd he had a fine contempt for the Hollywood studio establishment, something that may well have made his career less successful than it was. \nKirk Douglas was born Issur Danielovich Demsky to penniless Jewish immigrants in the city of Amsterdam, New York state, in 1916.  His father had fled Russia to escape conscription into the Tsar's army.\nOne of seven children, he sold snacks to local mill workers to earn enough money to buy food and in his autobiography claims to have had more than 40 jobs.\nIt was when he began acting in school plays that he decided a theatrical career was for him.  \"The one thing in my life that I always knew, that was always constant, was that I wanted to be an actor.\"\nAlready an inter-collegiate wrestling champion, he paid his way through drama college by fighting professionally, ushering and working as a car park attendant and bellhop.\nHe attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts where among his classmates were Betty Joan Perske, later to be known as Lauren Bacall, and the Bermudian actress Diana Dill. \nHe began using the name Kirk Douglas while acting during the college break and made his first Broadway appearance under his new name in a small part in a musical.\nIn 1941 he enlisted in the US Navy but was invalided out two years later because of injury and, in November 1943, he married his former classmate Diana Dill.\nThe marriage lasted eight years and produced two children, Michael, who would follow in his father's footsteps as an actor, and Joel, who became a film producer.\nDouglas had initially planned to become a stage actor but Lauren Bacall recommended him to producer Hal B Wallis who was casting The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. \nDouglas successfully tested for the lead role, playing opposite Barbara Stanwyck, already an established star. \nHe first made his name as a washed-up boxer, Midge Kelly, in Champion in 1949, which earned him the first of three Oscar nominations.\nAlthough he never won the coveted award, Douglas was honoured in the 1996 Academy Awards for 50 years as a creative and moral force in the movie industry.\nOne critic claimed the Kelly role epitomised his persona on and off screen as \"a ruthless, selfish, fiercely driven upstart\".\nHis ambition was rooted in his humble Russian origins. He was determined to defy privilege and anti-Semitism.\nSeveral of his most famous roles were as villains, such as the ruthless journalist in Ace In The Hole in 1951, who refuses to let sentiment or morality get in the way of a good story.\nHe won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life in 1956, but his own lust for power earned him many enemies.\nOne of his more notable roles of this period was as Colonel Dax, the commander of a French regiment on the Western Front in the Stanley Kubrick film, Paths of Glory\nBased on a real-life incident, Douglas is called upon to defend three soldiers charged with mutiny, who are eventually shot. Douglas resisted attempts by Kubrick to change the ending and reprieve the men.\nIn 1957 Douglas set up his own production company Byrna, named after his mother, in a bid to escape the grip of the big studios, which hired and fired at whim.\nHe also defied the anti-communist witch-hunts of the McCarthy era by openly hiring a blacklisted writer, Dalton Trumbo, to script Spartacus.\nThe movie, about a slave who rebelled against the Roman Empire, was seen by many as a metaphor for his own defiance of Tinseltown's power brokers.\nDespite being riddled with historical  inaccuracies, the film went on to win four Oscars.\nDouglas faded from the big screen in the 1970s but in his later years made a fairly successful comeback in films such as Tough Guys with Burt Lancaster and Greedy with Michael J Fox.\nHis energy did not flag as he grew older. He became a director, producer and novelist.\nDouglas served four US presidents in the role of special ambassador, and in 1981 received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nHe also created a charitable foundation and donated more than $1m to the Motion Picture and Television Fund.\nHis autobiography, The Ragman's Son, made the New York Times best-seller list. \nDouglas also wrote two novels, Dance with the Devil and The Secret. \nAs well as Michael and Joel, the children from his first marriage, he had two more sons, who also followed him into the world of movies.\nEric became an actor and Peter became a producer but only his eldest child, Michael, came close to equalling his father's fame.\nEric died in 2004 after an overdose of alcohol and prescription drugs, in what authorities in New York ruled was an accidental death.\nDouglas, who was given a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute in 1991, suffered a stroke in March 1996 which paralysed one side of his face.\nBut despite the stroke affecting his ability to speak, he was able to give the acceptance speech at the 1996 Academy Awards when he received a special award for \"50 years as a moral and creative force in the motion picture community\".\nIn the same year he played Chester J Lampwick in an episode of the hit animated series The Simpsons.\nHe continued to work, and appeared in films including Diamonds, in which he appeared with his old friend, Lauren Bacall, and  It Runs in the Family in 2003, which co-starred his son Michael, grandson Cameron and ex-wife Diana.\nKirk Douglas was one of the last great Hollywood stars who began their climb to fame at the end of World War Two and certainly one of the most defiant. \n\"I don't need a critic to tell me I'm an actor,\" he once said. \" I make my own way. Nobody's my boss. Nobody's ever been my boss.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51347201": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51347201", "title": "Warnings over British independent film scene's 'spiral of decline'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 01:41:37 GMT", "summary": "New figures reveal a sharp drop in the number of independent films made in the UK.", "story": "British film may have been celebrated at the Baftas on Sunday, but new figures have revealed a sharp drop in the number of UK films made last year.\nThe figures, from the BFI, showed a large reduction in the amount of money spent on homegrown independent movies.\nNew BFI chief executive Ben Roberts said there were \"major challenges\" for the British independent film sector.\nStewart Le Marechal, who produced 2018's Swimming with Men, said the scene was in \"a spiral of decline\".\nThe amount of money spent making films and high-end television in the UK rose 16% to a record \u00a33.6bn in 2019, the annual figures showed - thanks to Hollywood studios and US TV giants shooting more in Britain.\nBut spending on British films with no studio backing dropped by 45% to \u00a3175m, and the number of homegrown productions with budgets over \u00a3500,000 fell from 94 in 2018 to 49 last year.\nThe 2019 numbers are likely to rise to some extent as the BFI finishes gathering its information, but the final figures will still show a significant decline.\nGrowing problems finding funding and greater competition from TV are to blame, according to those in the British film industry.\nLe Marechal, whose 2018 comedy Swimming with Men starred Rob Brydon and Jim Carter, said the industry has been in a cycle of decline for a decade.\nThe problems are \"definitely something that we've been watching happen over the last 10 years, and I think it's just getting harder and harder\" to get films made, he told BBC News.\nIt all stems back to the financial crash of 2007-08, when producers started to find it harder to raise money in advance. This meant they struggled to attract big-name actors and had to cut budgets, Le Marechal believes.\n\"You're going in a downward spiral where, because you've got a lower-budget film, it's harder to sell to buyers because they say 'This is a smaller project',\" says the producer, whose recent projects include the documentary Last Breath.\n\"It's very difficult to halt that. Obviously people still are managing to make films, but as you can see, they're far fewer, and invariably, they're much lower budget.\n\"That makes it then harder for them to punch above their weight when they actually do make it to the marketplace, if they make it to the marketplace at all.\"\nIndependent British films released last year include Judy, Fighting with My Family, Blinded by the Light, Wild Rose and Mary, Queen of Scots.\nThe BFI doesn't count films made with Hollywood money, such as Sir Sam Mendes's Bafta-winning 1917, in its domestic figures.\nPippa Harris, producer of 1917, recently told Screen International that the biggest challenge currently facing the industry is the increasing difficulty to persuade studios to fund films unless they are part of a franchise or based on something well-known.\n\"We were extremely fortunate to be allowed to make 1917 without any major stars in the leads, but that freedom is rare,\" she said. (Sir Sam's name probably sealed the deal.)\nOther producers and directors have shifted to the small screen. Last year, the amount spent on high-end TV in the UK rose by 29% to a record \u00a31.66bn.\nClare Mundell's company Synchronicity Films used to make just features. Now around 80% of its work is in TV, making shows like BBC One drama The Cry, starring Jenna Coleman.\nShe says homegrown movies are caught in a \"perfect storm\", caused by changes to film financing and the \"massive upswing\" in opportunities in TV.\nTelevision is often more attractive because the revenues - from budgets afforded by outlets like Netflix, or the rights offered to production companies by British broadcasters - are more reliable, she says.\n\"In the midst of all that opportunity, it can be really hard to decide to risk your time going in to make a feature film at \u00a31.5m, which may never see the light of day and from which you'll probably not make a penny.\"\nBodies like BBC Films, Film4 and the BFI have been mainstays of the industry and are still backing British films and new talent.\nBut one crucial change, Mundell believes, is an overhaul of the Enterprise Investment Scheme - a tax incentive that attracted investors by cushioning some of their risk, but is now not open for most film projects.\nThe consequences of the decline in British films are \"really troubling\", she says. \n\"Very often they are films that are championing the talent of the future, the British directorial voices that in years to come will go on and have long and illustrious careers.\n\"If there are fewer films being financed at that level, then there are fewer opportunities for directors, writers, producers [and] actors. \n\"And if we've got 50% fewer independent British films being made, then we've got 50% fewer stories being authored about the themes that matter to Britain.\"\nAnother producer who has switched to TV is James Richardson. His company Vertigo Films made 2008's Bronson, which gave Tom Hardy an early starring role, and 2010's Monsters, helmed by future Rogue One director Gareth Edwards.\n\"Would we make them in the current climate? I don't think so,\" he says. \"And that's really sad, because it just means there are some amazing productions which are not able to be made.\"\nVertigo also made StreetDance, which reaped \u00a311.6m at the UK box office in 2010. \"The numbers that flowed down to us and the film-makers at the end of this massive success were not fantastic,\" Richardson says.\n\"The British independent film structures have got fundamental flaws to them, in terms of the way that finance happens and the terms in which producers and talent end up making any money.\"\nRichardson and his producing partner made the move to TV six years ago, and now make Bulletproof and Britannia for Sky.\n\"What's come into its place is this extraordinarily dynamic and incredibly creative TV world, where the film-makers are making the most extraordinary things,\" he says.\n\"And coupled with that you've got the most beautiful films being made. 1917 gets made. Yes, it's a studio movie, but it's a beautiful British movie.\"\nIn 2018, the BFI published an in-depth report into the state of independent British film that concluded \"the traditional business model for independent film is no longer fit for purpose\".\nThe BFI's Ben Roberts says: \"The whole ecosystem for making films and reaching audiences is undergoing huge structural change globally.\n\"New channels are opening up new opportunities for audiences but also for film-making talent - in short there is more fluidity for talent in moving between film and television,\" he adds.\nHe cites established movie-makers like Ben Wheatley, Lenny Abrahamson and Andrew Haigh, who are also working in TV.\n\"The good news is that there is more demand for film on all screens and more opportunities for our film-making talent,\" Roberts continues.\n\"But from our perspective it is also producing major challenges for the independent sector, much of which was highlighted by the work of the BFI's Independent Film Commission.\n\"It's important that we ensure independent film-making is sustained, because it is the lifeblood of film culture. It is very much a priority.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51414550": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51414550", "title": "Phillip Schofield on coming out as gay: 'Every person I tell, it gets a little lighter'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 10:33:18 GMT", "summary": "TV presenter Phillip Schofield has revealed he is gay, after 27 years of marriage to his wife Stephanie Lowe.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51415010": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51415010", "title": "Marian Keyes: 'I never know how my books will end'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:07:43 GMT", "summary": "The author tells BBC Radio 5 Live that her novels develop as she's writing them.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51395148": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51395148", "title": "Kirk Douglas dies aged 103", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:35:51 GMT", "summary": "The actor was one of the last surviving stars of Hollywood's Golden Age.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360643": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360643", "title": "The Irishman: How we made the actors decades younger", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:03:39 GMT", "summary": "How actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci were digitally de-aged.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51317385": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51317385", "title": "Oscars: The Toronto studio behind the shoes on screen", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:43:56 GMT", "summary": "Jitterbug Boy has crafted 17,000 pairs of footwear for film and TV productions.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51351347": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51351347", "title": "Baftas 2020: The highlights", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 01:31:37 GMT", "summary": "From Brad Pitt's message for \"single\" Britain, to crying mums - here are the best moments of the 2020 Bafta Awards.", "story": ""}}}, "theguardian": {"Politics": {"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun", "title": "Sturgeon's office 'tried to stop publication of Mackay schoolboy story'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:03:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>The Sun says the Scottish government raised concerns about intrusion into Derek Mackay\u2019s private life</p><p>The Scottish government faces fresh questions about the Derek Mackay scandal after it emerged it challenged the Sun\u2019s right to publish revelations about his private messages with a schoolboy.</p><p>Mackay resigned on Wednesday night after the Sun told him and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, it was publishing some of the 270 messages he sent to the 16-year-old between August last year and 1 February.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The Scottish government faces fresh questions about the Derek Mackay scandal after it emerged it challenged the Sun\u2019s right to publish revelations about his private messages with a schoolboy.\nMackay resigned on Wednesday night after the Sun told him and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, it was publishing some of the 270 messages he sent to the 16-year-old between August last year and 1 February.\nMackay told the unnamed schoolboy he was \u201creally cute\u201d, invited him to dinner and to a Scottish parliament event.\nOpposition leaders and senior Scottish National party figures said the messages were tantamount to grooming, and predatory.\nSturgeon said in a statement on Thursday: \u201cI think the conduct is unacceptable and I will not make any attempt to say otherwise or to minimise in any way its seriousness. Based on what I knew about this last night, it was clear to me then that Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct fell far short of what is expected of a minister.\u201d\nSturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, told MSPs that Mackay had been suspended from the party. \u201cI say very clearly that I am not aware of any further allegations or any conduct of a similar nature,\u201d she added.\nAs further claims about Mackay\u2019s private life came to light, it emerged that on Wednesday Sturgeon\u2019s office had disputed the Sun\u2019s right to publish the story.\nMackay, until then her highly trusted and powerful finance secretary, was due to deliver the Scottish government\u2019s annual budget on Thursday afternoon, setting out billions of pounds in new spending.\nTwo hours after it alerted Sturgeon\u2019s office to the story, \n, her office emailed the paper to claim that publication could be an intrusion into private and family life. The email asked for a guarantee the messages were obtained legally and said the Sun was morally obliged to pass them all to the government.\nThe email said: \u201cGiven you yourself state that there is nothing illegal or unlawful in the messages, can you advise on your justification for publication, given the intrusion into private and family life, and correspondence including digital communication.\u201d\nThe Sun was asked to confirm in writing \u201cthat the material has been obtained by legitimate means\u201d, and for \u201cthe material you are basing this story on to be emailed across to us as soon as possible\u201d.\nThe government said the Sun had a \u201cmoral obligation to share this material in order for us to be in a position to offer any form of substantive response or view\u201d.\nThe Sun insisted that Alan Muir, its Scottish editor, had read out the most significant and damaging messages to Sturgeon\u2019s office in two 15-minute phone conversations at 5.50pm and 6.40pm.\nSturgeon\u2019s officials believed they were justified in asking these questions, and in asking for written evidence, because of the seriousness and significance of the allegations.\nMackay was allowed to resign later that evening and the Scottish government refused to provide the paper with a response. The Sun published its main story online at 11pm on Wednesday.\nUntil 2018 Mackay was the SNP\u2019s national chairman and business convenor, and in charge of running party conferences. There was gossip within the party about his flirtatious behaviour after hours during conference.\nThe Record reported that Mackay had sent private Facebook messages to a 21-year-old activist, Shaun Cameron, in September 2017 asking whether he had any \u201cnaughty pictures\u201d and suggesting they meet at Mackay\u2019s Edinburgh flat.\nAnother former SNP staff member told the Herald that Mackay was ordered by Sturgeon to stop partying and drinking at conferences after his behaviour was discussed in internal meetings. He allegedly quipped during one conference in 2017 that delegates would not see him in the bar that night because \u201cNicola won\u2019t let me\u201d.\nJackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the allegations raised substantial questions for the Scottish government and SNP to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s vital the SNP leadership, instead of spinning, acts to establish a complete picture,\u201d Carlaw said.\n\u201cThere has been a collective failure of leadership both from the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the current SNP business convener, Kirsten Oswald. Both now need to respond and act with far greater urgency and understanding.\u201d\nThe government could have set up a hotline to report other concerns about Mackay\u2019s conduct, he added. The Scottish parliament did so after allegations about misconduct by MSPs emerged in 2018.\nAn SNP spokesperson said: \u201cDerek Mackay has been suspended from both the parliamentary group and the party while further investigation takes place. In the interests of due process, no further comment will be made.\u201d\nMackay has been approached for comment.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown", "title": "No 10 says Johnson's row with Trump over Huawei was \u2018overblown\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 20:29:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>US president was reportedly furious about PM\u2019s decision to use Chinese 5G expertise</p><p>Downing Street has sought to play down the significance of a difficult phone call between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over the UK\u2019s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build its 5G network.</p><p>Trump was reported by the FT to have been \u201capoplectic\u201d about the decision taken by Johnson, and the phone call last week was said by one official to have been \u201cvery difficult\u201d and tense.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Downing Street has sought to play down the significance of a difficult phone call between Donald Trump and \n over the UK\u2019s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build its 5G network.\nTrump was reported by the FT to have been \u201capoplectic\u201d about the decision taken by Johnson, and the phone call last week was said by one official to have been \u201cvery difficult\u201d and tense.\nA No 10 source said the account was overblown and that they did not recognise that characterisation of the call.

He also asked to see a psychiatrist in prison.\nHis lawyer, Sheik Amin, had told the court Spencer had experienced significant mental health problems after the suicide of his father, and that at the time of sending the messages last April he was \u201cin drink\u201d. It was the day after his birthday and he was having suicidal thoughts that his father was not there to help him celebrate, Amin said.\nJenkyns, who defeated Cooper\u2019s husband, Ed Balls, in the Morley and Outwood constituency in 2015, gave a statement to Leeds magistrates court defending Spencer.\nIn the statement read to the court on Friday, she said Spencer was \u201ca decent and honest person whose heart is in the right place and who always helps people in need\u201d.\nShe said she did not condone what he had done but claimed he had been \u201clet down by the system\u201d and desperately needed help for his mental health problems, including biopolar disorder and suicidal thoughts.\nAs well as attending the count in Cooper\u2019s constituency, at which the Labour MP was present, Spencer was at the \u201cBig Brexit Bash\u201d organised by Jenkyns in Morley on 31 January.\nIn an additional statement, Jenkyns said: \u201cI stand by my decision to have given him a personal reference.\u201d\nNoting that he had bipolar disorder and saying that she was concerned about his mental health issues, she added: \u201cI will be seeking assurances that he will get the support he clearly needs as part of his rehabilitation.\u201d\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, Cooper said Spencer was well-known to her and her constituency staff. She said case workers had given him considerable help with his mental health problems in 2017, when they were \u201cconcerned for his welfare\u201d.\nIn the statement she said: \u201cMPs across the country, particularly women MPs, have unfortunately become accustomed to a continued stream of abuse online and threats from a small number of people, often on the extreme fringes of politics. But this behaviour is not normal, and we must never treat it as so.\u201d\nAt least 10 people have been cautioned for making threats against Cooper, according to her staff.\nSpencer, who co-founded a group called Brexiteers of Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, was arrested after the message was passed to Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, who alerted Cooper\u2019s office.\nHe denied sending the message, suggesting he was being targeted for his political views, and was released under investigation. The following month he stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives in the local elections in the former pit village of Knottingley.\nIn June, he organised a demonstration against Cooper outside her constituency office in Castleford. The protest took place the same day as Cooper was taking part in The Great Get Together, a national event commemorating the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right extremist just before the EU referendum in 2016.\nIn court on Friday, the prosecutor, Susannah Proctor, read out a series of tweets posted online in September by Ellie Cooper, one of the MP\u2019s three children, talking about how \n.\nRemembering the day Jo Cox was killed, Ellie Cooper wrote: \u201cI am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day and never saw her again. I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.\u201d\nSentencing Spencer to nine weeks\u2019 immediate imprisonment, the district judge, Marie Mallon, said his offence was so serious because of the context in which it took place, following Cox\u2019s murder.

Even Joanna Cherry, a lawyer and SNP MP, suggested on Twitter that it amounted to \u201cgrooming behaviour\u201d.\nThe messages, showing Mackay had invited the schoolboy for dinner and to attend a rugby reception at the Scottish parliament, began on 2 August, and ended on 1 February, five days ago.\nThe boy\u2019s last responses to Mackay were on 27 December, when the then minister said the teenager was \u201clooking good with that new haircut\u201d, and called him \u201creally cute\u201d. Mackay sent him 18 messages that day, starting at 00.03am that morning.\nBut as shock about Mackay\u2019s conduct reverberated around Holyrood, questions also emerged about the timing of Sturgeon\u2019s actions.\nToday it emerged that the Scottish Sun first told Sturgeon\u2019s office about its plans to publish Mackay\u2019s messages at about 5.30pm on Wednesday, putting in train an urgent series of conversations between Sturgeon, Mackay and SNP lawyers.\nSturgeon\u2019s official spokesman confirmed on Thursday afternoon that Alan Muir, the Scottish Sun\u2019s editor, had telephoned him before 6pm to lay out the substance of the Sun story. Later that evening \u2013 her spokesman refused to say when \u2013 Mackay agreed to resign.\nIt was not until 8am on Thursday, 14 hours after she was told of the allegations and nine hours after the Sun\u2019s stories went online, that Sturgeon announced Mackay\u2019s resignation in a short statement.\nThe spokesman said they wanted to give Mackay time to tell his family about the Sun\u2019s revelations. Yet, despite their acknowledged seriousness, it was not until noon on Thursday that Sturgeon said in an emergency statement that he had also been suspended from the SNP.\nSturgeon told MSPs she had not been able to do so until she had been able read the full extent of Mackay\u2019s texts in the Sun. But the delay in announcing his suspension allowed Sturgeon to make her statement to parliament. There was no word, however, on whether Mackay would quit as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, triggering a byelection. Sturgeon has deflected that and other questions about the case, insisting that the SNP investigation has to take place.\nSources at the Sun insist that Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman was given all the salient texts on Wednesday evening. Muir had two conversations with Sturgeon\u2019s office that evening, giving them all the key information.\nJackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the delay in suspending Mackay was odd. \u201cThere was more than enough information at her disposal to suspend Mr Mackay as soon as she found it \u2013 that\u2019s not a decision that needed to wait until lunchtime the following day,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe first minister\u2019s main concern should be for this boy and his family, not her own PR requirements.\u201d\nSturgeon has already overseen one ministerial resignation for misconduct. In November 2017, her then childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, resigned from her government and was suspended by the Scottish National party following \n and had abused his position of power.\nIt was the first major test of Sturgeon\u2019s public support for a crackdown on male abuse of power in public life. The McDonald affair dragged on for months while the allegations were investigated by the party. He quit in March 2018, but rejected Sturgeon\u2019s calls for him to quit Holyrood, where he sits as an independent. \nShe also faced a crisis involving misconduct allegations against her mentor and predecessor, Alex Salmond. He is going on trial on 9 March facing 14 sexual offence charges, including one of attempted rape and one of intent to rape \u2013 charges that he has repeatedly denied.\nSalmond had resigned as an SNP member five months before he was \n, following a furious row with the Scottish government over its decision to release details of an internal investigation into misconduct allegations against him by two officials during his tenure as first minister.\nNews of that investigation was leaked in August 2018, more than a year after Salmond lost his Westminster seat of Gordon in the 2017 general election, ending a 30-year parliamentary career at both Holyrood and Westminster.\nSalmond fought and won a civil case against the Scottish government, which admitted in court a fortnight earlier that it had botched its internal inquiry. It had appointed a human resources specialist to lead that inquiry who had had previous contact with the two complainants about their allegations.\nOn the instructions of Lesley Evans, the permanent secretary, and Scotland\u2019s chief civil servant, the government\u2019s lawyers in court admitted that left the investigation \u201ctainted by apparent bias\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/tracy-brabin-will-auction-off-the-shouldergate-dress": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/tracy-brabin-will-auction-off-the-shouldergate-dress", "title": "Tracy Brabin to auction off 'shouldergate' dress", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:55:19 GMT", "summary": "<p>All money raised will go to the Girlguiding charity to support their work in the UK </p><p>Tracy Brabin has announced that she is auctioning the off-the-shoulder dress that drew criticism after she wore it in the Commons.

It is not clear how many people were affected by the scandal \u2013 many people lost jobs and homes, were denied benefits or healthcare, and in extreme cases were detained or deported \u2013 but since the government first apologised for the mistake in April 2018 over 8,000 people have been given documents confirming they are here legally.\nA two-year extension to the compensation deadline has been introduced, so that people affected by the immigration scandal, in which the Home Office wrongly classified thousands of legal UK residents as illegal immigrants, now have until April 2023 to claim.\nThe Home Office has also promised to make the application process more flexible, agreeing to take a wider range of circumstances into account. People will no longer be asked to prove that they took immediate steps to resolve their immigration status when they realised there was a problem.\nCharities working with claimants said that many people affected were so alarmed at being told they were here illegally that for years they avoided any interactions with the Home Office or any official organisation.\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cSuccessive governments failed the Windrush generation, which is why we have listened to feedback from community leaders and those affected, to hear how the government can begin to do justice to those who have contributed so much to our country.\u201d\nThe Home Office\u2019s announcement was welcomed by groups supporting people to apply for compensation but there was disappointment that no money had been allocated to pay for legal advice.

She applied last April and is angry at the long wait, not least because she remains in debt as a result of the issue. She spent 18 months semi-destitute in Grenada, before being allowed to return when the problem was uncovered in 2018.\n\u201cI ring every week and they tell me: \u2018I can\u2019t give you any information, it is with a case worker, it is being processed,\u2019\u201d she said. Receiving compensation would represent \u201can end to all the grief\u201d.\nSome applicants who have been granted money say they are unhappy with the amount, and put this down to not having had advice when they filled in the form. Glenda Caesar said she was going to turn down the \nin December, describing it as \u201cinsultingly low\u201d because it only covered a year\u2019s loss of earnings even though she was out of work for a decade because she was deemed to be here illegally. She came to Britain legally as a three-month-old child in 1961. The Home Office scheme allows people to ask for the payment to be reviewed.\nMartin Forde, the barrister who designed the scheme, said the changes meant the scheme would \u201cbe easier to navigate, more accessible than ever and will provide fair compensation to all those affected\u201d.\nBell Rebeiro-Addy, the shadow immigration minister, said it was disappointing that so few people have received payments. \u201cIt is good that the scheme has been extended but there are \n after what happened to them.

It goes further than EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has suggested to diplomats in private that the UK should maintain current EU standards in most areas, in exchange for a zero-tariffs, zero-quota trade deal, an approach known as \u201cnon-regression\u201d. (Although Barnier is thought to favour keeping the UK in step with the EU on state-aid policy.)\nWhile the European parliament cannot bind EU governments to accept a more demanding \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d stance, its position may prove influential, especially as MEPs must approve the final deal at the end of the year.\nNot all MEPs have decided whether they support the maximalist position. But many are worried about the EU being undercut by a \u2018Singapore-on-Thames\u2019 style UK, a fear British sources consider unfounded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally clear, but a lot of my colleagues will not accept that we have [UK] free access to the market, but some dumping situation in the United Kingdom in the production and processes,\u201d the head of the parliament\u2019s international trade committee, German Social Democrat Bernd Lange, told journalists recently. Lange is one member of the MEP group that drew up the draft resolution.\nThe resolution, which will be put to the vote of the full parliament next Wednesday, also:\nThe resolution also throws light on a post-Brexit dispute settlement body, showing that the EU is ready to consider alternatives to the European court of justice, as long as they offer \u201cequivalent guarantees of independence\u201d. But the parliament text states that only the ECJ can interpret EU law, a likely EU red line that is already provoking anger among British Eurosceptics seeking to break free of European courts.\nOn regulation, the European parliament may be pushing at an open door, as France, Denmark and the Netherlands \u2013 vocal players in \n talks \u2013 have also voiced support for dynamic alignment in private meetings.\nvoiced support for the general idea that the UK should adhere to core EU standards in exchange for an unprecedented zero-tariff, zero-quota deal that does not exist in any other EU free-trade agreement.\n\u201cWe are not going to agree that quota-free, tariff-free access, if there is no level playing field,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cBecause we cannot sell to our voters and to our companies \u2026 that they are being undercut by competitors. We are just not going to do that.

But the novelty had now palled rather. These weren\u2019t her people and Lady Nicky had outgrown the Commons.\nSo it was junior minister Nigel Adams who found himself having to handle a tricky urgent question on the \n that Her Ladyship was unable to answer in person.\nWhat Nicky had said about the \n had never been intended as a declaration of war. Absolutely not. He couldn\u2019t understand how people might have got that impression. The government considered the Beeb to be a beacon of British values and the only reason it now prevented ministers from appearing on some of its programmes was because most of them were simply not good enough. Boris Johnson just didn\u2019t want to lower the quality of the BBC\u2019s output with worthless contributions from his cabinet of fools.\nThere was no sinister agenda in play, Adams insisted. All Lady Turncotes had done was to implement an eight-week consultation period, during which a wide range of views would be heard, and at the end of which the government would do exactly as it had planned all along.\nThere would be no criminal prosecutions for non-payment of the licence fee, followed a short while later by the abolition of the licence fee itself. Then hopefully no more Beeb. Other than that the BBC would be free to do whatever it wanted. Simples.\nThe shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, was not exactly reassured by this. She reminded Adams that non-payment of the licence fee wasn\u2019t exactly a pressing problem for the criminal justice system \u2013 only five people were currently in prison for the offence \u2013 and that most people considered the licence fee as the fairest form of funding for a public service broadcaster.\nAnd on the question of accountability and transparency, the government should start by looking at its own record on banning journalists from prime ministerial events and lobby briefings.\nAll Adams could do was to continue to play dumb. Something that comes relatively easily to him, if not quite so easily as to some of his colleagues. The timing of the consultation had nothing whatsoever to do with the government\u2019s desire to avoid public scrutiny. Even though there had been precisely nothing about the licence fee in the Tory manifesto just two months ago. It was just one of those things. An amazing coincidence.\nJust like it had been total serendipity that, only 24 hours after giving an interview about how Johnson \u2013 a man for whom he had never previously disguised his contempt \u2013 was basically a \u201creally, really good bloke\u201d whom he had always admired, Philip Hammond was in line to join Lady Nicky in the Lords. Failing upwards is very on trend at the moment. There must be hundreds of Tory MPs, both past and present, who will be waiting for the official announcement with intense anticipation.\nOne of whom could well be \n, who had earlier answered environment questions. Villiers is yet another cabinet minister whose entire political career has been built on under-achievement. The most memorable thing she has ever done in her 15 years in parliament was to be one of two MPs to have joined the 380-metre \u201cMarch to Freedom\u201d during Andrea Leadsom\u2019s short-lived campaign to become Tory leader in 2016. But all mediocre things must come to an end eventually, and Villiers is tipped for the chop in the imminent reshuffle.\nThe Commons was more or less deserted for Villiers\u2019 last stand \u2013 a bad day for the ticket touts who had eagerly been promoting her farewell appearance \u2013 but the environment secretary dutifully fulfilled her brief in her usual semi-detached manner. Her face is always devoid of expression and, in years to come, philosophers will debate whether she is more alive than dead.\nStill, Villiers did achieve a minor triumph in saying almost nothing of interest. She steered clear of the row over COP 26 \u2013 possibly because she had no idea the conference was even due to be taking place \u2013 and prevaricated over whether an Australian-style trade deal would mean no tariffs on koalas and kangaroos that had been barbecued in the bushfires.\nThe closest she came to a coherent statement was that the whole point of Brexit was for Britain to waste a lot of time and money deciding to implement the same food and environmental standards that we had in the EU. It was a fittingly apt note of futility on which to bow out. Arise Lady Theresa.

Senior German politicians have even been drafting a series of partnership offers to the UK on security, defence and foreign affairs, possibly wrapped up in a new Anglo-German friendship treaty.\nBut the hardline tone of Johnson\u2019s recent speeches has thrown the German political class visiting London for a week-long symposium at the London School of Economics. The former trade minister \n was forced to reassure his German interlocutors that the British people did not want to set up a \u201c\n\u201d, and nor did Johnson.\nBut Ralph Brinkhaus, the parliamentary leader of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, said: \u201cWithin the next 11 months we have to decide what the common base of the relationship will be with the UK. We will compete. No question about that and no one is afraid of that. But we can have competition with cooperation or competition with conflict. Listening to the government\u2019s speeches this week, I am not quite sure what the position is of the UK.\u201d\nRobert Habeck, the leader of the German Greens, and a potential German chancellor after next year\u2019s elections, was also gloomy that a deal could be struck. He said: \u201cJohnson has stated that under no circumstances does he intend to conduct the negotiations after 11 months. He has categorically ruled out extension of the negotiations. He does not want to accept the EU rules for work, environment, or the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. The EU, on the other hand, cannot accept tax or regulatory dumping on its doorstep and must protect its single market and insist on a level playing field. The risk of an unregulated no-deal Brexit is still high, and maybe has never before been higher.\u201d\nThe anxiety was shared by Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and a member of Merkel\u2019s party. \u201cThe question is whether we are listening to policy or rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a danger on both sides that the intense rhetoric about principles gets emphasised time and again and so creates a reality of its own. The risk is that it gets difficult to switch to a different pragmatic response by the end of the year because that would mean losing face.\u201d\nHe suggested the scale of the negotiations, and the apparent differences between the two sides on issues such as regulatory alignment and the European court of justice, meant a full deal would be unachievable by the end of the year. \u201cThe rhetoric will continue through the summer on both sides, but the people that are working on the technical stuff will try to do their job.\u201d He said an initial deal might be reached by November \u201ccovering security, and those trade areas that are vital to limit mutual damage\u201d. But he predicted that such a deal would have leave out a significant proportion of trade that would then have to be negotiated further on a sectoral basis in a process freed of artificial time limits.\nThe choice for both sides, he said, was between mutual self-harm and a cooperative relationship.\nAsked in March 2016 how Germany would react if Britain left the EU, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the current Bundestag president, said: \u201cWe will cry.\u201d The tears have been shed, but the angst remains.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/daniel-kawczynski-tory-mp-told-by-party-attendance-at-far-right-event-unacceptable": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/daniel-kawczynski-tory-mp-told-by-party-attendance-at-far-right-event-unacceptable", "title": "Tory MP told by party attendance at far-right event 'unacceptable'", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 17:48:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>Backbencher Daniel Kawczynski apologises after conference appearance in Italy </p><p>The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski has received a formal warning for attending a conference with notorious far-right political figures.</p><p>The Shrewsbury and Atcham MP apologised for attending a conference alongside nationalist leaders in Rome earlier this week after party bosses branded his behaviour unacceptable.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/daniel-kawczynski-tory-mp-told-by-party-attendance-at-far-right-event-unacceptable\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski has received a formal warning for attending a conference with notorious far-right political figures.\nThe Shrewsbury and Atcham MP apologised for attending a conference alongside nationalist leaders in Rome earlier this week after party bosses branded his behaviour unacceptable.\nHe had previously argued that the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s far-right League, who had also been scheduled to speak at the event, \u201crepresent serious ideas and concerns, some of which are shared by many citizens of the UK\u201d.\n, Kawczynski criticised the Guardian for \n about his involvement in the conference.\nHe wrote: \u201cThe paper has suggested a Tory MP should not speak at an event \u2018with far-right\u2019 figures on the subject of nationalism.

The ruling will no doubt be popular \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to have much sympathy with anyone who willingly signs up to the virulent misogyny and bloodlust of Isis. However, Begum\u2019s banishment throws up two major questions.\nFirst, we need to know why a straight-A teenager from east London would willingly leave Britain to embrace a death cult. It defies all reason. Somehow this child was groomed and radicalised, not in some far-away country bereft of democracy, but here on British soil and without the knowledge of her parents. Before condemning her we need to know how this naive teenager was pushed in this direction. If she\u2019d been sexually groomed at this age we would not be vilifying the victim.\nAnd, second, the British government\u2019s decision to sever her citizenship is in effect burying its head in the sand. Though Bangladesh has washed its hands of her, Javid, and his successor Priti Patel, still claim Begum can apply for citizenship in that country, where her parents were born. But she\u2019s a product of Britain, not of Bangladesh \u2013 a country she has never visited. Her rights as a British citizen \u2013 born here, raised here, and with an east London accent \u2013 should transcend the seriousness of her crime, and she should be tried on British soil. Doing otherwise sets a dangerous precedent.\nAnd, moreover, it sends a signal to all British ethnic minorities. Like many of us born here in families whose parents or grandparents migrated from abroad, Begum knows this country and no other. And until recently it\u2019s only been the far right who have questioned black and brown people\u2019s right to be here. But given that all ethnic minorities have family connections to other countries, it now places a question mark over all of our futures. Should we be convicted of a crime (and let\u2019s face it, our communities are already heavily policed and there\u2019s a long history of us being unfairly targeted by the criminal justice system), we may now face a double punishment \u2013 of deportation as well as the original sentencing.\nAs a British citizen myself, of Pakistani descent, is it fair that my citizenship rights could be stripped if I committed a crime, that I could be banished to a country where I have no tangible connections other than the fact my grandparents migrated from there decades ago? \nMore and more, the idea of \u201cBritishness\u201d seems to be squeezing out ethnic minorities, and especially our right to be who we are. We\u2019ve had a decade of attacks on multiculturalism; endless debate about \u201cBritish values\u201d, \n; we\u2019ve seen a \n since the Brexit referendum. And to cap it all, we\u2019ve had the Windrush scandal, and the election as prime minister of a man who insults Muslim women and black people. A British identity inclusive of black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities is dying right before our eyes.\nWhen I was growing up, my grandparents who migrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s \u2013 when the far right National Front loomed daily \u2013 spoke ominously of returning to Pakistan before the British government kicked them out. They were the generation who shuddered as they listened to Enoch Powell lament that \u201cin this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man\u201d.\nBegum\u2019s crime (for which she has yet to be tried) is grievous indeed. However, with this verdict upheld, the government message is loud and clear: play by the rules, or risk having your citizenship revoked. It seems my grandparents weren\u2019t as melodramatic as I thought after all.\n Aina Khan is a writer and playwright and a former presenter for British Muslim TV\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-scottish-politics-tough-new-tests-all-round": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-scottish-politics-tough-new-tests-all-round", "title": "The Guardian view on Scottish politics: tough new tests all round | Editorial", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 18:30:15 GMT", "summary": "The scandal over Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct is only one of the challenges facing the party and its opponents, despite the opportunity afforded by Brexit<p>In UK terms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/derek-mackay-scottish-finance-secretary-quits-over-messages-to-boy-16\" title=\"\">Derek Mackay</a> is not a high-profile politician.

The first minister sees this as an injustice for which the best remedy is \n \u2013 but she sees that as the remedy to everything, which diminishes the potency of the argument.\nBrexit gives nationalists a resonant new grievance. It does not improve the economic case for independence or make it easier to achieve. But the pro-independence side\u2019s defeat in the 2014 referendum is a bigger problem for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Johnson never tires of pointing out that the SNP recognised the once-per-generation status of that ballot. Mr Johnson is a terrible messenger for unionism \u2013 a caricature of English Tory arrogance \u2013 but he is not wrong to remind nationalists that \n recently chose to stay in the UK. Many Scottish voters think a first minister\u2019s energies might more usefully be spent governing than demanding a referendum rematch.\nMs Sturgeon\u2019s riposte is that Brexit has changed facts and minds, so the rematch is democratically imperative. Some \n indicate a slender pro-independence majority, with a pivotal shift in that direction caused by a migration of EU remainers who voted no in 2014. Ms Sturgeon wants to ride that mood to victory in next year\u2019s Scottish parliament elections. Such a result would, she believes, signal enough backing for a second referendum that Mr Johnson would be obliged to grant one. More radical nationalists believe Westminster\u2019s permission is not required, but legally it is. The first minister is wise to stick to the letter of the law. An aggressive snatch for independence would suffocate Scotland\u2019s prospects of one day rejoining the EU. \nThe long game has mostly suited the SNP, but it has limits. When the Holyrood poll comes around, the party will have been governing for 14 years and gaps in its record cannot be ignored. Scottish schoolchildren \n in literacy and numeracy tests relative to their English peers. Scottish \n is bogged down in a crisis so acute that the chair of the watchdog authority washed her hands of it in December. Tory austerity is the SNP\u2019s default excuse for poor services but public spending is around 20% higher per capita than in England. Ms Sturgeon cannot shrug off the weight of incumbency indefinitely. The Mackay scandal makes that attempt much more difficult than it was already.\nWhatever difficulties the SNP faces, it is blessed with weak and incompetent enemies. Under \n, Labour blurred its position on a second referendum and has yet to regain focus. Mr Johnson\u2019s lines are crisp, but his crass manner boosts the separatist cause. If the case for preserving a United Kingdom is monopolised by a Tory party pumped up on Brexit, the argument will fall flat. That case should stand above party loyalties. It should escape the arena of competing nationalisms \u2013 English and Scottish \u2013 and appeal to a wider sense of shared history and collective endeavour. Sadly, leaders who are gifted at expressing that vision are in short supply. The arguments are not well rehearsed. Supporters of the EU discovered the equivalent weakness of their position too late. Believers in a United Kingdom must not make the same mistake.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/power-everything-progressives-boris-johnson-donald-trump": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/power-everything-progressives-boris-johnson-donald-trump", "title": "Power is everything \u2013 and progressives forget that at their peril | Jonathan Freedland", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:08:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>As Boris Johnson and Donald Trump know, winning gives you the ability not just to pass laws but to make the weather</p><p>You take comfort where you can.

When a single week can see Britain leave the European Union and \n bragging and swaggering in vengeful celebration as he escapes punishment for a high crime he clearly committed, the need for soothing can become intense. One such solace is that, despite the concrete defeats visible all around us, the left is somehow \u201cwinning the argument\u201d.\nThat view lives on in corners of the British Labour party. Witness those diehard followers of the party leader, \n that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to nationalise Northern Rail or introduce free hospital parking proves that it was Jeremy Corbyn who really won the big contest of December 2019. Perhaps those devotees didn\u2019t notice the key words in that sentence: \u201cPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u201d.\nIn the US, a more defensible version of this attempt to find sunshine in the gloom centres on the observation that politics exists downstream from culture, and that while three of the four institutions of the US government (the presidency, the Senate and the supreme court) are in the hands of the right, at least power over the commanding heights of the culture \u2013 the media, the Academy, entertainment \u2013 lies elsewhere. On this view, Trump might well retain the White House in November, even if he once again loses the popular vote; just as Republicans enjoy a \n in the Senate, even as they regularly win far fewer votes for that body too \u2013 but liberals will always have Hollywood.\nHowever, these comforts are delusional. If recent events have reminded us of anything, it\u2019s that in politics, power is the whole ballgame. \nIn the US, Trump is crowing that he has succeeded where his predecessors failed by coming up with a Middle East \n that represents a \u201chistoric breakthrough\u201d in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The quote marks around those phrases are doing some very heavy lifting. It\u2019s not a peace plan at all, but rather a \n for the wishlist of one side of the conflict \u2013 namely, the Israelis \u2013 or, more accurately, for the most extreme elements of that one side. Naturally, no Palestinians agreed to this plan, nor was a single Palestinian present at the unveiling.\nTo greet it as a historic breakthrough was an absurdity that would have made Lewis Carroll blush. To watch Trump applaud his achievement was to watch a football manager praising his side for winning 10-0 when they were the only team on the field and the opposing goal was open and empty. If only Obama, Bush Jr, Clinton, Bush Sr, Reagan or Carter had realised that success meant simply giving one side all it wanted, why, they could have negotiated a historic breakthrough decades ago.\nObviously the Trump peace plan will fail if its objective is to bring peace. But if its true aim is to reframe the conflict, to redefine the parameters of any future negotiation away from the two-state solution that has long been the international consensus and towards an arrangement that will allow \n to annex all the bits of the West Bank it wants, leaving Palestinians with a fragmented, Swiss cheese of a state comprised of disconnected enclaves, then its prospects are much healthier.\nLike it or not, Trump\u2019s ludicrously (and dangerously) unjust plan will be the starting point for any future US administration. If an incoming US president wants to adopt any halfway credible plan, they will first have to rescind many or most of the concessions to Israel that Trump granted \u2013 and that will cost political capital. Thus has Trump already left a lasting imprint on that corner of the Middle East, inflicting yet more loss on a people, the Palestinians, who have already lost so much.\nIn Britain, the damage is of a less lethal variety, but still deadly serious. Johnson\u2019s government is stepping up its \n, seeking to erode public support for the licence fee that funds it and boycotting its flagship news programmes. This week it widened its attack to include other news organisations, and indeed the principle of a free and independent press, by \n which outlets are and are not allowed to cover it, a move lifted straight from the Bumper Book of Trump. The effect could be a fundamental reshaping of the British media landscape, altering the way this society learns about itself and, in turn, how its democracy functions.\nThe point here is that neither Trump\u2019s anti-peace plan nor Johnson\u2019s assault on the BBC were the policies on which those men were elected; they were not in their party platforms or manifestos. And yet they illustrate the power of elected office, not simply to implement a stated programme but to make the weather, to set the terms of trade. Most significant of all, a party in power has the ability to create the conditions that ensure it keeps it.\nThe anti-BBC project is an example, aimed at weakening a source of accountability that might otherwise make life harder for this Tory government. The looming threat to the UK judiciary is another, as Johnson \n for last autumn\u2019s supreme court ruling, which voided his unlawful suspension of parliament. Armed with a Commons majority of 80, the prime minister now has the power to shrink that potential check on his authority. In the US, control of the presidency and the Senate has allowed Republicans to remake the supreme court in their image, so that it hands down rulings \u2013 on \n, for example \u2013 that help them and hurt their opponents. \nIt\u2019s understanding the power of power, a truth so obvious that it should barely need stating, that is driving some battle-hardened veterans of past left campaigns to despair. \u201cNothing. Without power, there is nothing,\u201d \n, who ran the last successful Democratic effort to oust a sitting Republican president when he masterminded Bill Clinton\u2019s victory back in 1992. He\u2019s alarmed that some of his fellow Democrats seem to be downgrading, if not actively disdaining, \u201celectability\u201d as a criterion in choosing their nominee. For him it is the first, most fundamental requirement. As he put it after this week\u2019s Iowa fiasco, the only consideration that matters is a candidate\u2019s ability to beat Trump \u2013 because \u201cthere\u2019s only one moral imperative and that is to beat Donald Trump\u201d.\nOf course, \u201celectability\u201d is a hard thing to prove for certain until it\u2019s tested (by which time it\u2019s too late). But the first step is to accept its importance, to recognise that winning power is the sine qua non of politics, literally the thing without which there is nothing.

It may go against the prime minister\u2019s instincts, but it is the best hope for Britain to live up to its responsibilities in a crucial year for our species.\nJohnson cannot do this on his own. That much was clear this week \n of the COP 26 UN climate summit, which will take place in Glasgow in November. This will be the most important international conference in five years and as host the UK will play a leading role in deciding whether it ends in success or failure.\nThe event was overshadowed by \n Claire O\u2019Neill, who responded with a scathing takedown of a premier who she described as \n, failing to devote sufficient resources to summit preparations, and being fundamentally untrustworthy.\nThe firing was not all bad news. O\u2019Neill lacked the political heft and diplomatic skill needed to forge a global consensus on this most divisive of issues. If a more senior politician is appointed in her place, it would show the UK is taking preparations more seriously. The fact that the prime minister is fronting the launch demonstrates an investment of political capital that is commensurate with the challenge.\nHe also \n, most concretely by confirming the UK\u2019s commitment to go net-zero on carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cOf course it\u2019s expensive, of course it\u2019s difficult, it will require thought and change and action, people will say it\u2019s impossible and it can\u2019t be done, and my message to you all this morning is that they are wrong,\u201d he declared. \u201cI hope it will be a defining year of action for our country, and indeed for our planet, on tackling climate change but also on protecting the natural world.\u201d\nBut can he be trusted and can he deliver? On that question, almost all the evidence \u2013 from parliamentary voting records and donations from climate sceptics to his newspaper columns and performance as mayor \u2013 says no.\nAlthough Johnson has repeatedly called for reduced emissions, \n in the Guardian\u2019s climate scorecards last year based on his rejection of actions that would achieve this in five key parliamentary votes. This includes opposition to onshore wind subsidies, emissions-based vehicle taxes and carbon capture and storage.\nHe was also shown to have \n of \u00a35,000 from Michael Hintze and \u00a325,000 from Terence Mordaunt (via First Corporate Shipping), who fund the climate science sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation.\nThe Conservative party says the Guardian cherry-picked votes and failed to recognise Johnson\u2019s support for the net zero emissions target. The Guardian stands by its methodology, which \n.\nOther broader data sources confirm the prime minister\u2019s woeful record on parliament. \n that Johnson has \u201calmost always voted against measures to prevent climate change\u201d with one vote in favour, eight against and six absences (the latter largely due to his period as mayor of London).\nThe gulf between words and deeds was also evident when Johnson was foreign minister, when he oversaw a 60% cut in the UK\u2019s team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to 65, just as the UK was supposed to be delivering the Paris agreement. He then tried to hush up what happened, \n, who claimed Johnson also ignored his advice to be more publicly supportive of climate change and misled the public about King\u2019s agreement to chair an inquiry into building an airport in the Thames estuary.\nWhile mayor of London, his record was mixed. On the positive side, he electrified the bus fleet, raised diesel charges, improved cycling networks and encouraged tree planting and zero-emission taxis. But he also held back a report on the impact of air pollution on deprived schools and curtailed a western extension of the congestion charge zone, which could have reduced traffic and improved air quality.\nHis most famous green boast was that he would lie down in front of bulldozers to prevent a third runway being built at Heathrow airport. But was absent during the 2018 vote on this issue, and strongly supported his own pet airport project \u2013 a four-runway mega-terminal in the Thames estuary that never got off the ground.\nJohnson\u2019s \n provide copious proof that he does not \u201cget\u201d climate change. In 2012, he described wind farms as \u201cwhite satanic mills\u201d, supported shale gas fracking and \n who warn of the dangers of emissions.\nOn three occasions, he blithely \u2013 and completely wrongly \u2013 claimed global heating was primarily caused by solar activity. \u201cWhatever is happening to the weather at the moment, it is nothing to do with the conventional doctrine of climate change,\u201d he wrote in 2015, citing the debunked claims of the climate sceptic \n \u2013 the brother of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He was scoring points against a political opponent by dismissing the consensus view among scientists that the climate crisis is driven by human activity.\nThe prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, is, by contrast, a committed environmentalist who has campaigned for faster action on climate change. At an Extinction Rebellion demonstration last year \n to wear the badge of \u201cnon cooperative crusties\u201d, which was the criticism levelled by his son at protesters. His influence is apparent in Boris Johnson\u2019s endorsement of various wildlife campaigns, which he presents in colonial fashion as the fault of other nations. A quick glance at his backlist of articles reveals attacks on Japan for whaling, China for the slaughter of pangolins, and a belief that African elephants and cheetahs need to be saved by the UK.\nOn the basis of his diplomatic clumsiness, poor grasp of science and voting record, Johnson appears to be the worst man for the job of making COP 26 a success. But, beyond his dad, there are two other reasons to hope that he might yet turn the pig\u2019s ear of preparations into a silk purse of an event. If the democrat in him \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly in his adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2013 decides strong climate action is the will of the electorate (as polls overwhelmingly suggest), then he could demonstrate this by pushing it through with the same determination as Brexit. And if the patriot in him makes up his mind to make the UK a global leader in solving the greatest challenge of our age, then he will recognise the need to appoint a strong candidate to replace O\u2019Neill.\nIn this week\u2019s speech, he alluded to this in an encouraging recognition of the UK\u2019s responsibility to decarbonise. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite proper that we should, we were the first, after all, to industrialise. Look at historic emissions of the UK, we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way and to do this,\u201d he said.\nSadly it seems more likely, given his own history and \n, that Johnson will put political partisanship first and bow to pressure from the US to downplay climate concerns in return for a trade deal, and from his donors and supporters to weaken EU environmental standards so the UK economy is more competitive after Brexit.\nFather will not approve. But Corbyn\u2019s brother, at least, will have reason to smile.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/begum-verdict-emerges-from-thin-arguments-of-security-v-humanity": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/begum-verdict-emerges-from-thin-arguments-of-security-v-humanity", "title": "Begum verdict emerges from thin arguments of security v humanity", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:28:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>True story of schoolgirl turned Isis member played only a small part in court deliberations</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-loses-appeal-against-removal-of-citizenship\">Begum loses first stage of appeal against citizenship removal</a><br></li></ul><p>Shamima Begum was unable to \u201cplay any meaningful part in her appeal\u201d, according to the British court that nevertheless decided her fate, because of the difficulties in communicating with her while she was stranded in a Syrian refugee camp.</p><p>The 20-year-old, who fled east London to join Islamic State, was unable to contribute evidence in her own defence, as she was living, her lawyers said, in \u201csqualid\u201d and \u201cwretched\u201d conditions in the crowded al-Roj camp, guarded by Syrian Kurds.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/begum-verdict-emerges-from-thin-arguments-of-security-v-humanity\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": " was unable to \u201cplay any meaningful part in her appeal\u201d, according to the British court that nevertheless decided her fate, because of the difficulties in communicating with her while she was stranded in a Syrian refugee camp.\nThe 20-year-old, who fled east London to join Islamic State, was unable to contribute evidence in her own defence, as she was living, her lawyers said, in \u201csqualid\u201d and \u201cwretched\u201d conditions in the crowded al-Roj camp, guarded by Syrian Kurds.\nAs a result, Begum\u2019s story \u2013 and the threat she may or may not pose if she returned to the UK \u2013 played only a small part in the largely technical deliberations of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) in a basement courtroom.\nNevertheless, Siac\u2019s decision on Friday \u2013 that \n by the previous home secretary Sajid Javid last year \u2013 built on the fact that Home Office lawyers had argued she was too dangerous to be allowed to return to the country of her birth.\nAged 15, Begum ran away from home and school in Bethnal Green with two friends, stealing an older sister\u2019s passport to reach Syria as Islamic State emerged from the wreckage of the country\u2019s civil war.\nBegum soon married a 23-year-old Isis fighter called Yago Riedijk, from the Dutch city of Arnhem. Over the next three years the couple had two children, both of whom had died, and Begum was nine months pregnant with their third when, last February, she was rediscovered in another refugee camp \n.\nBegum had fled the battle of Baghuz, where Isis was making its last stand. \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here,\u201d she said, referring to her original decision to travel to Syria, but added: \u201cNow all I want to do is to come home to Britain.\u201d\nSix days later, Javid revoked her British citizenship, arguing that she had the right to take Bangladeshi citizenship via her parents, even though she had never visited the country and did not speak its official language, Bengali.\nBegum was one of more than 100 Britons who travelled to join Isis to be treated this way, and \n. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for,\u201d he said.\nShortly after Javid\u2019s decision, Begum gave birth to a son, Jarrah. But disease was rife in the insanitary conditions of the sprawling al-Hawl camp where they were living. It was labelled the \u201ccamp of death\u201d because so many children had died there, and Jarrah became one of them, contracting pneumonia and dying 10 days later.\nThe national security argument heard in court was that Begum had aligned with the Islamist group not only by travelling to Syria but by remaining until nearly the last days of the self-styled caliphate, thus showing a high degree of commitment to it.\nSecurity sources have gone further, suggesting Begum was \n, during which time she carried a Kalashnikov and had a reputation for strictness. Begum also allegedly \u201cstitched suicide bombers into explosive vests\u201d. These are all claims the intelligence community stands by, arguing that women are as capable as men of actively participating in a violent regime.\nIn the citizenship hearing, Begum\u2019s lawyers said it was difficult to obtain information from their client that would enable them to comprehensively defend her. \u201cIt is not possible to take instructions on her intentions, the circumstances in which she left, what she has been doing, family relations and so forth,\u201d her barrister, Tom Hickman QC, said during the four-day hearing in October.\nThe exact truth may never be properly examined, given the immigration tribunal\u2019s verdict on Friday. However, if Begum were to win her appeal against it, and somehow return to the UK, security sources have indicated she would almost certainly face a terrorism trial.\nThat said, they argue, it would be difficult to obtain evidence from Syria that could stand up in a British court. The likelihood is that the most serious charge that could be levied against her would be membership of a banned organisation, Isis, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.\nLess than a week after the terrorist stabbing in Streatham, and with ministers also pushing through emergency legislation to \n for terror offenders, Conservative politicians feel their hard line on Begum is not only justified but politically popular.\nMore broadly, the government is refusing to repatriate any of the 60 or so men and women from the UK being held in prisons and camps in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria \u2013 and depriving them of citizenship where possible. In one case, the Home Office is willing to allow four children, all under 10, to return to the UK, \n.\nIt fell to Begum\u2019s lawyers to make an alternative argument. Daniel Furner, of Birnberg Peirce, said some other countries \u201cdealing with similar cases, in particular of very young women, have found safe, sensible and humane ways of returning and reintegrating their citizens quietly, and with expert advice, into a normal existence\u201d.\nLegal proceedings, Furner concluded, \u201cfail to provide swift and practical answers to such acute human predicaments as this\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/trade-deal-trump-america-uk-climate-ambitions-2050": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/trade-deal-trump-america-uk-climate-ambitions-2050", "title": "A trade deal with Trump\u2019s America would shred Britain\u2019s climate ambitions | Stephen Buranyi", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:04:38 GMT", "summary": "<p>The US will most likely try to lock in protections for its fossil fuel industry, jeopardising plans to decarbonise the UK by 2050</p><p>Few things have loomed larger in Brexit imaginary than the stupendous trade deals the UK will get as soon as it frees itself from the thicket of European Union regulation.

The US will push aggressively against anything that blocks American companies from doing business here, and there are few things on which the two countries are more divided than climate policy.\nThe UK has ambitious plans to \n, while the US has little policy and no targets to speak of. So the government will struggle to come to an agreement without sacrificing its already fragile climate commitments. Trade deals are increasingly about \n (a very EU-ey word) of standards and regulations to allow foreign goods and services into our borders. And it won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that alignment with the US rarely leads to stronger regulation; instead, trade agreements often act as a powerful and undemocratic tool to erode or supersede existing protections.\nThe common example is the fear of poorly checked, \n being sold in the UK. But the gulf between the US and UK on climate is even larger than on food standards. Documents from a 2018 meeting, leaked in November, set out a harsh starting position: the US will \n or include the term in any deal, which means it won\u2019t consider existing climate policies legitimate grounds for opposition to any of its demands.\nThis suggests the American negotiators will push to weaken existing low-carbon standards, or worse \u2013 given the UK has many climate targets but little actual concrete policy as yet \u2013 lock in clauses favourable to the fossil fuel industry that can\u2019t be easily overturned by domestic legislation. This would effectively head off climate policy before it can be written. A similar thing played out before negotiations when the UK was part of the EU: in the now stalled \n (TTIP), the US pushed for wording that would prevent initiatives to help renewables compete with fossil fuels. That demand is likely to be repeated, with the American fossil fuel industry keen to get fracked gas as well as \n into the UK.\nThe government\u2019s recent fracking ban could also come under pressure from US companies looking to operate here. In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation.\nPerhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an \n \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of \n under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011.\nWith an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes.\nClimate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts. But \n, the minister in charge of negotiations, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are deregulators of the highest order. Both were co-authors of the 2012 book \n, which criticised the UK for a \u201cbloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation\u201d. They maintain that the government is committed to its existing climate targets, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll actually back the protections we need in order to meet them.\n Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/government-imploding-may-boris-johnson-exclude-journalists-john-crace-digested-week": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/government-imploding-may-boris-johnson-exclude-journalists-john-crace-digested-week", "title": "Even when her government was imploding, May never tried to exclude me | John Crace", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:08:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>All governments try to control by giving access to favoured journalists, but Boris Johnson is taking it to new levels</p><p>It had felt like something of a no-brainer when the Premier League changed the kick-off of Spurs\u2019 game against last season\u2019s champions, Manchester City, to suit the Sky TV schedules.

Why would I want to put myself through the pain of watching my team get annihilated when I also had tickets to see Ermonela Jaho give her debut recital at Wigmore Hall on the same day and there wasn\u2019t enough time to do both?\nBut watching the match on TV (well, all but the last 10 minutes) before we headed off into central London, I began to have my doubts. This was the game in which Spurs managed to concentrate their entire season\u2019s good luck \n. Man City totally dominated the game, while Spurs, despite playing just as indifferently as they have for most of the season, scored from the only two shots they had in the first 89 minutes. It was the jammiest 2-0 win you will ever see and Spurs now only need another three points to be sure of avoiding relegation. Surely even they can\u2019t screw this up?\nBut once at the concert I knew I had made the right call. Two hours of the most sublime music making. Jaho is the world\u2019s finest soprano. End of.

At a lobby briefing on Monday, No 10 had divided the journalists into two sections on either side of the carpet and told one lot that they were being kicked out. After a brief row, \n. No 10 then tried to spin the walkout as a misunderstanding: the briefing had been for specialists only \u2013 but the only specialist present was among those who had been refused access.\nEarlier in the day I had \n of a Downing Street exclusion order when I was banned from attending the prime minister\u2019s Brexit speech in Greenwich. The official version was that it was \u201cstrictly one journalist per media outlet\u201d and the Guardian already had someone going. Only the Times was mysteriously allowed two journalists. A colleague who was there took a photo of several rows of empty seats.\nAll governments try to control the media agenda by granting special access to favoured journalists who they trust not to question their side of the story, but Boris and Classic Dom are taking it to new levels. Even when her government was imploding Theresa May never tried to exclude me from anything to which other sketch writers were invited.\nPreparations to host COP 26, the UN climate change conference, in Glasgow later this year appear to be in total disarray \n, Claire O\u2019Neill, as head of the UK\u2019s organisation team. No 10 has claimed O\u2019Neill was not up to the job, while she has told the media that the government was hopelessly disengaged from COP26 and Boris Johnson didn\u2019t really understand the realities of climate change. Since then it has emerged that David Cameron was offered O\u2019Neill\u2019s job but \n. Maybe, too, the money on offer just wasn\u2019t enough for him to rearrange his diary. It\u2019s now emerged that \n \u2013 probably a great deal more \u2013 from various well-paid gigs that appear to have required little effort between leaving office in 2016 and April last year. Brexit has certainly been extremely kind to his bank balance. As it has to May. For the current register of interests shows that since stepping down as prime minister in July last year, May has earned \u00a3400,000 in addition to her MP salary. Bizarrely, the bulk of that money has come from public speaking. For one speech to JP Morgan Chase in London that would have taken up a maximum of five hours in preparation, travel and delivery time, May trousered a mere \u00a375K. Since there can\u2019t be anyone who hasn\u2019t \n, one can only assume the former PM was hired as a comedy or curiosity act. There are few people who can lose an audience quite so quickly as May. So, as someone who has done as much anyone to publicise May\u2019s difficulties with sentence construction and absence of meaning, I\u2019m now waiting for my 15% commission. It would be my own Brexit bounce.\nDon Powell, Slade\u2019s drummer for the best part of 60 years, claims \n. You\u2019d have thought the frontman, Dave Hill, might have at least chosen to end such a long relationship by FaceTime but perhaps he only does that for people he has known for 75 years. Presumably, Dave still considered Don to be a relative newcomer to the band. Bizarrely, for someone who was pathologically unreliable and totally disengaged throughout my 20s while doing a series of jobs in which my employers clearly regretted my existence almost as much as I did, I have only ever been sacked once. And that was totally deserved and done face to face. It was during the heatwave of 1976 and I was working an ice cream machine, that would have failed all current health and safety legislation, outside a souvenir shop in Leicester Square. After a couple of months my time-keeping had become increasingly erratic \u2013 principally because I was up most nights taking large quantities of every drug on offer and was finding it harder and harder to fit in a job around my antisocial life. One afternoon I was startled to get a tap on my shoulder. My boss had been doing his rounds \u2013 he owned numerous concessions in the West End \u2013 and had found me passed out while propped up against the ice cream machine. He didn\u2019t even bother to shout at me. He just gave me a weary look of resignation and politely told me it was time I went home and didn\u2019t come back. I could only agree. I\u2019m not sure who was more relieved, him or me.\nIt seems hard to believe that it is still only early February as the year seems to be dragging by. Not that I have managed to achieve that much while time has slowed down. Rather, my inner world has been dominated with feelings of acute anxiety, depression and a sense of futility. On many days it has been a real battle to get out of bed. Things that should provide pleasure have felt increasingly transient and out of reach while even my dreams have given me no respite from a feeling of dread. At times I have felt as if I was doing little more than existing. Going through the motions of being John. Or a barely remembered version of John. I\u2019ve been too depressed even to worry about getting \n. As ever, my family have done more than their fair share of holding me together.

These are just some of the \u201copportunities\u201d for deregulation offered in \n for the public to propose ways to diverge from the EU rulebook.\nSlashing European regulation has long been an article of faith for the Tory party, fulfilling both its Thatcherite and Europhobic instincts. No matter that recent history \u2013 from the global financial crisis to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower \u2013 has taught us that regulation is a public good to be protected, not an evil to be eradicated.\nJust like Boris Johnson, Javid has learned to live outside history, eschewing any responsibility for his party\u2019s decade in power. Brexit is presented as a fresh start for the country and the government. The idea of divergence is crucial to provide \n with a sense of purpose.\nBut the truth is Brexit will create a more bureaucratic state rather than a more agile one. The UK now needs to build its own \n in Whitehall to replace those that were delegated to Brussels. From medicines to chemicals to aviation, the UK will need to replicate European agencies, no matter the chancellor\u2019s ideological bent. Instead of sharing these regulatory functions with 27 other states, Britain will now need to shoulder the responsibility alone. Brexit will be a boon for British bureaucrats.\nGood regulation requires deep technical expertise. Neither the public, politicians nor commentators possess the expertise to judge whether medicines are safe or whether complex financial instruments pose a risk to economic stability. Brexit may have been the politics of the gut \u2013 the instinct that the country would be better off out \u2013 but it is only viable with a vast expansion in the number of technocrats.\nSo what will these technocrats do? The fundamental error is to think that less burdensome regulation means a lower regulatory burden. In practice it means two sets of regulation to replace one, if the UK and the EU operate with different standards and rules \u2013 even if they are lighter touch here than across the Channel. That means complexity goes up, not down.\nMoreover, product markets are increasingly global, not local. So any firm that wants to export into the European single market will need to match its regulatory requirements. Products will be produced to the highest standards, not the lowest. For any goods produced here that firms want to export, deregulation is merely a mirage.\nThere are some areas where Britain could realistically deregulate, though none are desirable. It could erode \n, lowering the cost of production. But we already have one of the most \u201cflexible\u201d labour markets in the world \u2013 and many Brexit voters expect more protection not less. The UK could cut back on environmental standards, but this would be inconsistent with commitments under the Paris climate agreement.\nWhile financial regulation was given effect by an EU directive, this was based on the global \n: diverging from these would make the UK a pariah a little over a decade since the global financial crisis nearly tipped the world economy into a depression due to the sharp business practices of banks in the City of London as much as Wall Street. The Bank of England has always been a more important financial regulator than the European commission.\nThe truth is that Britain\u2019s economic problems are the result of a failed free-market model. The path to success lies in a more active and entrepreneurial state that works in partnership with business and unions to raise productivity and unleash innovation. Our problems are of our own making. Only in the delusions of Brexit fantasists is putting the lead back in paint the way to put the great back in Great Britain.\n Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/john-bercow-bullying-allegations-westminster-accused-parliament": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/john-bercow-bullying-allegations-westminster-accused-parliament", "title": "The Bercow bullying allegations matter far beyond Westminster | Gaby Hinsliff", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 07:00:02 GMT", "summary": "In any walk of life, the accused must be confronted \u2013 no matter how important they are.

It happens in elite sport, when fans don\u2019t want to hear what their heroes do off the pitch so long as they keep winning. And it looks worryingly as if something similar may have happened with the allegations now piling up against \n.\nThe former Speaker of the House of Commons has long been accused of bullying and intimidation behind closed doors, though he categorically denies it. His former private secretary, \n, claimed to have been undermined, sworn at and physically intimidated; and Sinclair\u2019s successor, \n, was reportedly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year in the job. This week another ex-colleague, former Black Rod David Leakey, accused the Speaker of having \n and said he should not be granted the peerage for which Jeremy Corbyn has apparently recommended him.\nThe list goes on, although it\u2019s impossible to know the truth of such allegations without a formal inquiry. All we\u2019re left with is an uneasy sense that this isn\u2019t justice, for either side, and there are many unanswered questions about how we got here. Would the Speaker have survived intense public pressure to resign \u2013 or at least face formal and specific investigations \u2013 after these allegations first surfaced back in 2018, if hopes of stopping Brexit hadn\u2019t rested so heavily on him at the time?\nEveryone knew, after all, that if he was forced out then parliament would be lucky to find another Speaker so fearless or creative. Everyone knew too that the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for the country. And the blunt truth is that many remain supporters, in and out of Westminster, were willing to overlook quite a lot for that. When Labour MPs stuck by him, doubts were swallowed, perhaps partly because many remainers were suspicious of the role pro-Brexit press and politicians played in demanding his scalp. But only this week did it become obvious how much that episode has damaged parliament\u2019s credibility. If it cannot lead by example, then it is weakened when sitting in judgment on other institutions\u2019 blind spots.\nThis week, MPs debated a government-commissioned report into the failure to stop the disgraced breast cancer surgeon \n. The litany of failures echoes so many previous inquiries: a doctor who felt above reproach; colleagues whose concerns were dismissed; managers jolted into action far too late. For years, Paterson dangerously under-treated some patients, performing what he called \n that left excessive amounts of tissue behind, while grotesquely over-treating others who didn\u2019t actually need surgery. Patients who came to him worried about a lump were told in the starkest terms that they would die without an operation, that their children would be motherless, and that it was so urgent they should pay to see him privately if they could rather than waiting for surgery on the NHS. One poor woman had seven operations in 10 years, only to find out later that there was no proof she had the pre\u2011cancerous condition Paterson had described.\nYet he was only \n after the first concerns were raised by colleagues. The inquiry team concluded that both the private and NHS hospitals employing Paterson displayed a \u201cnotable absence of curiosity\u201d about their hot-shot surgeon, known locally as the one to whom other doctors sent their wives. The man now serving 20 years in prison for wounding with intent was, they noted, said to be one of the biggest earners at the private Spire hospitals in Birmingham \u2013 while at the city\u2019s Heart of England NHS hospital he had a reputation for being domineering, and difficult when challenged.\nBut what does any of this have to do with Bercow, who, even if he was guilty of everything his critics say and more, would obviously not be in the same league as an Paterson? Nothing, on the surface, yet Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary debate on the disgraced doctor makes uncomfortable reading for those with Leakey\u2019s words ringing in their ears. MP after MP gravely agreed with the public health minister Nadine Dorries that whistleblowers must be heard across the public sector, that managers must investigate without fear or favour, and that organisations should never close ranks just because it\u2019s awkward. They\u2019re right, of course. But at the moment parliament feels a long way from having any moral authority.\nBercow was a champion of parliamentary independence and a reforming Speaker whose family-friendly approach helped make political careers possible for parents of small children. He didn\u2019t stop Brexit, but helped ensure parliament wasn\u2019t steamrollered into it. If he had his flaws, so do most people in public life.\nYet to ennoble him without first getting to the truth of allegations about his behaviour towards his staff, whatever that truth might be, sends all the wrong signals both about parliament\u2019s ability to set the highest example, and public willingness to look away when it suits us. It should not be too late, even now, to put the record straight.\n Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/07/martin-rowson-on-chinas-reaction-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak-cartoon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/07/martin-rowson-on-chinas-reaction-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak-cartoon", "title": "Martin Rowson on China's reaction to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 cartoon", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:21:17 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/martin-rowson/products/8th-february-2020\">Buy a copy of this cartoon in our print shop</a></strong></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/07/martin-rowson-on-chinas-reaction-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/06/steve-bell-boris-stanley-johnson-dad-diplomacy-cartoon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/06/steve-bell-boris-stanley-johnson-dad-diplomacy-cartoon", "title": "Steve Bell on Stanley Johnson's dad diplomacy \u2013 cartoon", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 19:45:48 GMT", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/06/steve-bell-boris-stanley-johnson-dad-diplomacy-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/05/steve-bell-impeachment-donald-trump-cartoon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/05/steve-bell-impeachment-donald-trump-cartoon", "title": "Steve Bell on the trial of Donald Trump \u2013 cartoon", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:30:18 GMT", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/05/steve-bell-impeachment-donald-trump-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/mike-pence-hints-uks-huawei-decision-could-jeopardise-trade-talks": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/mike-pence-hints-uks-huawei-decision-could-jeopardise-trade-talks", "title": "Mike Pence hints UK's Huawei decision could jeopardise trade talks", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 18:53:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>Vice-president says US is \u2018profoundly disappointed\u2019 with Chinese firm\u2019s 5G involvement</p><p>US vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a> appeared to hint on Friday that White House disquiet at the involvement of Huawei in building the UK\u2019s 5G network could jeopardise trade talks between the two countries.</p><p>Pence told the US broadcaster CNBC: \u201cThe United States is very disappointed that the United Kingdom has decided to go forward with Huawei.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/mike-pence-hints-uks-huawei-decision-could-jeopardise-trade-talks\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "US vice-president \n appeared to hint on Friday that White House disquiet at the involvement of Huawei in building the UK\u2019s 5G network could jeopardise trade talks between the two countries.\nPence told the US broadcaster CNBC: \u201cThe United States is very disappointed that the United Kingdom has decided to go forward with \n.\n\u201cWe are profoundly disappointed \u2026 When I went at the president\u2019s direction in September I met with Prime Minister Johnson and I told him the moment the UK was out of Brexit we were willing to begin to negotiate a free trade arrangement with the UK.\u201d\nAsked whether the decision could prove a \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d, he replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\nThe US considers the Chinese technology firm \n \u2013 but also appears to be exercised about its commercial dominance.\nTrump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, has even said this week that the US should be \u201cactively considering\u201d buying up stakes in Huawei\u2019s rivals Nokia and Ericsson, to offset Chinese control of the telecoms sector, \u201ceither directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies\u201d.\nThe British government has been keen to press ahead with \n.\nIn a written ministerial statement published on Thursday, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said: \u201cA key priority is to deepen trade and investment relationships with like-minded partners, \n, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\u201d\nShe set out some of the government\u2019s aims, including opening up more of the lucrative US services market to British companies.\nBut London and Washington have clashed over a series of policy issues in recent weeks, including the chancellor\u2019s determination to \n.\nThe initial reaction from US officials to the Huawei decision was muted, but it emerged on Thursday that the president vented his exasperation in a phone call with \n last week.

It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is usual for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.\nYou cannot do anything in Westminster without a bit of pomp and circumstance. A ceremony of prorogation involves a message from the Queen being read in the \n, and then Black Rod summoning MPs from the Commons to the Lords. A list of all the bills passed by the parliament is read, followed by a speech on behalf of the Queen announcing what has been achieved by the government before MPs are sent home. Given what is on the order paper in parliament on Monday, this is likely to happen very late this evening.\nThere are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week.\n includes a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held, but is nevertheless longer than usual.\nMost obviously, though, the country is approaching the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU. Parliament has been working to pass a law that would prevent the UK crashing out without a deal, regardless of the fact that Boris Johnson has promised to leave on that date \u201c\n\u201d. With no deal agreed, and noises off suggesting the government might ignore any law requiring them to agree an extension with the EU, some politicians have been dismayed that parliament will not be sitting while the situation remains unresolved.\nAll work on legislation going through parliament stops. The government can, in some circumstances, carry over a bill into the next session \u2013 but only time will tell whether Johnson\u2019s priorities for government match the legislation that had started its progress through the house when Theresa May was in charge. There are some particular concerns that a lot of cross-party work and campaigning on \n will now go to waste.\nAll committees stop too \u2013 so Wednesday\u2019s scheduled appearance by the prime minister at the Commons liaison committee is cancelled, and after last week\u2019s debut, it will now be several weeks before Johnson faces another PMQs.\nNo. The timing of prorogation is entirely in the hands of the government, although there have been failed attempts in the courts to prevent it.\nJohnson intends for parliament to return on 14 October with a Queen\u2019s speech, which he says will \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d.\nHe will then almost immediately have to head to Europe for the vital EU council, which is the last chance for him to obtain a new \n deal or to ask for an extension of article 50.\nAssuming MPs do not vote for a general election on Monday \u2013 and all the indications are that they will not \u2013the earliest the UK can have a general election will be in November. Opposition parties have said they will push for an election as soon as they are sure a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been prevented.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/key-workers-to-be-given-30-discount-in-new-housing-scheme": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/key-workers-to-be-given-30-discount-in-new-housing-scheme", "title": "Key workers to be given 30% discount in new housing scheme", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>Shadow housing secretary labels initiative for first-time buyers as \u2018another empty promise\u2019 </p><p>Key workers, such as nurses, police and military personnel, will get priority under a new scheme offering homes for first-time buyers at a 30% discount, the housing secretary will say on Friday.</p><p>Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, said the new \u201cFirst Homes\u201d scheme, first announced during the election campaign, would save eligible buyers an average of approximately \u00a3100,000 on a first property.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/07/key-workers-to-be-given-30-discount-in-new-housing-scheme\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Key workers, such as nurses, police and military personnel, will get priority under a new scheme offering homes for first-time buyers at a 30% discount, the housing secretary will say on Friday.\n, the housing secretary, said the new \u201cFirst Homes\u201d scheme, first announced during the election campaign, would save eligible buyers an average of approximately \u00a3100,000 on a first property.\nThe Ministry of Housing, \n and Local Government is launching a consultation on how the scheme will work on Friday, without saying how many will be on offer.

Credit Suisse insisted the use of private detectives was a one-off incident but then in December admitted \n. Rohner said on Friday that the emergence of the second spying case had \u201cmade the situation worse\u201d and had forced the board to act.\nAs rumours swirled about the genesis of the affair, sources told the Financial Times last year that Khan\u2019s departure from \n followed a period in which he and Thiam had developed a personal animus towards one another.\nKhan was a rising star within the bank who was often talked about as a potential successor to Thiam, thanks to his success leading a wealth management division that enjoyed increasing profits and a burgeoning global reputation. While the pair got on well at first, they allegedly clashed outside the office over issues that arose between them as next-door neighbours in the Herrliberg area of the so-called \u201cgold coast\u201d of Lake Zurich.\nThiam complained to the bank about the inconvenience caused by lengthy renovations to Khan\u2019s home, the FT said.\nKhan later clashed with Thiam\u2019s partner during a cocktail party, in a disagreement that supposedly revolved around some trees planted on the Thiam property. During a subsequent confrontation, the two men had to be physically separated, Khan told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.\nAs a result of their personal feud, Khan, who was also said to have been frustrated with his lack of profile at the bank, was reportedly allowed to leave with a shorter notice period than would usually apply. The bank then hired private investigators to follow him, amid concern he might poach talented staff from Credit Suisse.\nKhan has alleged that three men employed by private security firm Investigo chased him and his wife through the streets of Zurich in a car, leading to a physical confrontation. Investigo has said there was only one man, that it was Khan who did the chasing and that its staff kept their distance.\nRohner initially supported Thiam over the affair but when it emerged that a second executive had been under surveillance \u2013 Peter Goerke, the former head of HR at Credit Suisse \u2013 relations between the two became strained.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, Credit Suisse\u2019s largest investor suggested that Thiam may have encountered racial bias in the Swiss banking industry.\nDavid Herro of Harris Associates said: \u201cTo be very frank, it seems [like] envy from competitors or perhaps something else given that Mr Thiam looks a little bit different than the typical Swiss banker. Either one of these two rationales behind these attacks against him, to me are extremely distasteful.\u201d Herro added on Friday that he believed Rohner should follow Thiam out of the bank.\nAn investigation by an external law firm in October formally cleared Thiam of involvement in the Khan spying affair and resulted in Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e, the chief operating officer and Thiam\u2019s closest ally, being fired over the Khan dispute.\nIt also emerged that a private security consultant who had helped Bou\u00e9e organise the spying had apparently killed himself.\nEarlier this week Thiam appeared to have the upper hand in Rohner\u2019s attempt to oust him, gaining the backing of several top Credit Suisse shareholders.\nHowever, on Friday he said he had agreed with the board to step down as chief executive. \u201cI had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place.\u201d\nThiam will step down after presenting the bank\u2019s annual results next week. The news of his departure sent Credit Suisse\u2019s share price down 4% in early trading but the stock later recovered its losses.\nRohner told Swiss radio: \u201cAt some point we realised that we couldn\u2019t get out of this situation unless we made a change and \n understood that too.\n\u201cTidjane has made an enormous contribution to Credit Suisse since he joined us in 2015. It is to his credit that Credit Suisse is standing on a very solid foundation and has returned successfully to profit.\u201d\nDismissing suggestions of xenophobia in appointing a Swiss successor to Thiam, Rohner said of Gottstein: \u201cOne thing that was not a factor was the colour of his passport,\u201d he said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-house-prices-rising-property-market-halifax": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-house-prices-rising-property-market-halifax", "title": "UK house prices rising at fastest rate since February 2018", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:03:56 GMT", "summary": "<p>Halifax shows rate of growth at 4.1%, partly due to sales delayed amid 2019 uncertainty</p><p>UK house prices are rising at their fastest annual rate for nearly two years, according to Halifax, prompting claims that the property market is heading into the crucial spring season in reasonable shape.</p><p>Halifax said <a href=\"https://static.halifax.co.uk/assets/pdf/mortgages/pdf/january-2020-halifax-house-price-index.pdf\">house prices rose by 0.4% in January</a>, adding just over \u00a31,000 to the average pricetag of \u00a3240,054.

The UK aviation sector this week committed to \n by 2050, wiping out its carbon emissions despite taking more than 100 million extra passengers into the air each year.\nAt a celebratory event in London, the bosses of airports, airlines and aircraft manufacturers queued to scrawl their signatures on a giant Net Zero pledge card from the Sustainable Aviation [SA] campaign.\nGreenpeace described it as greenwash. But aviation figures insist the ambition is genuine. John Holland-Kaye, the Heathrow airport chief executive, says: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s like it is for alcoholics. The first step is to admit we have a problem \u2013 and then do something about it. I\u2019m not sure what the 10 points on the AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] programme are, but you can find the equivalent in the SA roadmap.\u201d\nThe steps certainly involve a leap of faith, in future fuels and aircraft technology, and human capacity to endlessly offset emissions. Just how does a growing industry plan to reduce its annual footprint from just over 36m tonnes of CO2 to net zero in three decades\u2019 time?\nAircraft such as Boeing\u2019s 787 or Airbus\u2019s A350 already emit significantly less than the older jets they are replacing, through lighter materials and more efficient engines. Sustainable Aviation anticipates that emissions will drop by about 30% on routes operated by Boeing 747 jumbos as they are phased out within a decade. The next iteration of the manufacturers\u2019 short-haul workhorses are supposed to be 10%-15% more efficient \u2013 demonstrated with the A320neo superseding A320s, although the \n of the grounded Boeing 737 Max has \n.\nAltogether different types of propulsion will be in operation by the 2030s, manufacturers believe. But while new electric planes could revolutionise regional flights, and hybrid-electric could manage short-haul flying, their contribution to cutting UK emissions \u2013 about 65% of which hail from flights of more than 1,000 miles \u2013 will be comparatively minor by 2050, SA admits.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be electrifying a London-Singapore A380 for a long time, if ever,\u201d says Paul Stein, chief technology officer of aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce. \u201cBut sustainable fuels can work on the engines we have today, and the concept has been proved.\u201d\nCreating the necessary volume is the tricky bit. Hopes have been pinned on new schemes, such as the new \n from household waste. Stein says Rolls-Royce has been exploring whether a small modular nuclear reactor could be used in a synthetic fuel plant, making hydrocarbons in a way that would reduce CO2 to balance the emissions produced in flight.\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re in analysis phase \u2013 understanding the economics \u2026 But what we\u2019re going to see over the next 10 to 20 years is a lot of innovation and energy directed at creating sustainable aviation fuel.\u201d\nProgress in coordinating European airspace and air traffic control has been slow. But with better use of airspace, and coordinated flight paths, planes could be guided more efficiently from take-off to landing. The UK is in the midst of redesigning its airspace to help create better paths. More efficient operations, such as eliminating stacking, would help aircraft carry and burn less fuel.\nEnvironmental groups question the adequacy of offsetting \u2013 but the roadmap relies on it to account for more than a third of aviation\u2019s projected emissions. Jonathan Counsell, head of sustainability at British Airways\u2019 owner IAG, says: \u201cWe think that we can get to net zero without it \u2013 but not by 2050. This is a transitional measure.\u201d The scepticism about offsetting means, Counsell admits, that any schemes have to be high-quality, independently verified and end in actual, additional carbon removal. For now, offsetting means reforestation or restoration of peatland bogs that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere; later, potentially, investment in new carbon capture and storage technologies.\nIn an industry run by accountants, some jiggery-pokery was perhaps inevitable: emissions are \u201csaved\u201d as the 70% rise in passengers by 2050 is, in fact, slightly lower than the Department of Transport\u2019s growth forecast growth.\n\u201cWe will have to pay more to fly,\u201d says Holland-Kaye. Sustainable fuels are more expensive, and the carbon price is expected to rise tenfold, he says. The price of all the offsetting that the industry will rely on will be passed on to consumers through higher fares, constraining demand.\nSo can this work? The industry urgently wants to present an alternative vision to the growing backlash against flying. Stein says: \u201cFlying connects the world \u2013 it is a force for good in transporting people and goods, making sure our cultures have great levels of understanding.\u201d\nAs an engineer, he says, he is optimistic that emissions can be brought down sooner than the roadmap pledge: \u201cWe have the engineering tools to do it; we need the will, and government help.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/burberry-impact-coronavirus-hong-kong-china": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/burberry-impact-coronavirus-hong-kong-china", "title": "Burberry says impact of coronavirus worse than Hong Kong protests", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:26:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>British brand closes 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China as shopper numbers plummet</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/burberry\">Burberry</a> has said the coronavirus is having a devastating effect on the luxury goods market, as wealthy Chinese consumers stay away from shops and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees.</p><p>The British company closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China and those that remained open were operating with reduced hours because shopper numbers had plunged 80%.

There will be a similar cut for the 4m homes that have a prepay meter, with the average price of gas and electricity to fall from \u00a31,217 to \u00a31,200.\nOfgem has lowered the cap, which is designed to guarantee \n, in line with the falling price of gas and power on the wholesale energy markets. It will take effect from 1 April and remain in place for six months.\nThe energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cThe price cap is saving the average bill payer between \u00a375 and \u00a3100 per year, helping everyone get through the cold weather without worrying about costs.\u201d \nOfgem\u2019s \n, Jonathan Brearley, said the cap had saved households about \u00a31bn since it was introduced at the beginning of last year but energy billpayers could make bigger savings by \u201cshopping around for a better deal\u201d.\nCheaper fixed-term deals can help homes save several hundred pounds a year if they switch from a default tariff, compared with a \u00a317 saving from the lower price cap.\nSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said switching to a new energy deal could do \u201cfar more good than the cap ever will\u201d.\nThe cap fell by less than some industry commentators had predicted because the tumbling cost of wholesale energy last year was offset by the rising cost of maintaining the energy networks and paying for government policies \u2013 all of which must be paid for through energy bills.\nRobert Buckley, an energy expert at Cornwall Insight, said early predictions that the cap might fall by as much as \u00a360 a year \u201cfocused largely on the wholesale element and did not factor in some of these extra policy and network costs\u201d.\nHe said Ofgem had made some \u201ctechnical adjustments\u201d to its price cap calculations to update the typical consumption of UK homes and the costs of supplying energy, to reflect changes in the industry.\nThe Guardian reported late last year that millions of homes could look forward to lower energy bills in 2020 after \n to reach lows not seen in a decade.\nIn the UK the market price for gas hit 10-year lows of 24.75p a therm in September, compared with an average price of 55.63p the year before after a record number of gas cargoes from the US, Russia and \n poured into Europe.\nS&P Global Platts has predicted the price of gas could fall by a further 30% to an average of 27p a therm in 2020 as more seaborne gas cargoes make their way to UK shores.\nBuckley said if wholesale energy markets remained similar to what was seen in the winter, customers could expect \u201canother slight reduction\u201d to the cap later this year. However, households should still consider switching their tariff or supplier to find the best energy deal, according to consumer groups.\nEd Dodman of the Energy Ombudsman said the regulator\u2019s falling energy price cap \u201cshouldn\u2019t discourage people from shopping around for better deals. We would encourage consumers to look at the customer service they can expect to receive as well as how much money they could save.

It \n for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors, requiring that 1) they are free from the company\u2019s control; 2) they are doing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business; and 3) they have an independent business in that industry.\nAs a means of complying, Uber now allows drivers to get more trip information up front before accepting a rider\u2019s request, including travel time, distance, destination and estimated fare. Drivers can now reject ride requests without penalty.\nThe change gives drivers the illusion of more autonomy, but \u201cseems like a trick\u201d, said Veena Dubal, an associate professor of labor law at University of California-Hastings. If a driver sets a fare too high, they may end up waiting longer for a passenger. If they set it too low, they won\u2019t be able to cover their costs.\n\u201cThis is incentivizing a race to the bottom\u201d, Dubal said. \u201cI am skeptical this is good for workers.\u201d\nNor will it help Uber drivers to pass the three-part test at the center of AB5, Dubal said, as the core of Uber\u2019s business will still be driving. Drivers will thus fail part two, which declares a worker must be \u201cdoing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business\u201d in order to be a contractor.\nInstead, she suggested these changes may lead customers to believe drivers have more autonomy than they do, which is key ahead of the ballot measure Uber has\n in 2020 to counteract AB5.\nUber drivers have long asked for more freedom to cancel rides, but the changes are too little too late, Gregg said.\n\u201cNothing has really changed, but Uber makes it as convoluted as possible to make it seem like they have changed,\u201d he said.\nSince 21 January, Uber has been testing an additional feature in several cities that allows drivers to set their own payment rates, in an effort to prove its employees are contractors with freedom to set their own wages.\nUnder this new bidding system, Uber sets a base fare and drivers are then able to increase the rate in 10% increments, to reach up to five times the base price of the ride set by Uber. Uber then matches each rider with the driver who has set the lowest price. Drivers who have set higher fares will be matched as more rides are requested.\nIt is currently being tested only at airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento, a spokesman for the company said. He said these changes were meant to \u201cenhance drivers\u2019 control\u201d over their earnings to address AB5.\n\u201cSince AB5 has gone into effect, we\u2019ve made a number of product changes to preserve flexible work for tens of thousands of California drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now doing an initial test of additional changes which would give drivers more control over the rates they charge riders.\u201d\nUber has also introduced measures on the rider side, showing them a range of prices based on distance and time when hailing a ride rather than the set rate provided in the past. They will also be able to select \u201cfavorite\u201d drivers to be matched with again in the future.\n\u201cThis has much more to do with public perception than whether it will actually have a legal impact on AB5,\u201d Dubal said. \u201cThe intention is to create confusion among the riding public and among drivers.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises", "title": "Broadband: new warnings to end rip-off price rises", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:30:03 GMT", "summary": "<p>Under new rules, millions of users paying too much will have to be told of better deals</p><p>New rules from next Saturday will force companies offering broadband and home phone deals to tell customers what they were paying on their old contract and how much their bill is going up, in a move designed to encourage users to shop around.</p><p>It follows research by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom\" title=\"\">Ofcom</a> which found that 20m households are no longer on their provider\u2019s initial contract \u2013 and overpaying as a result.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "New rules from next Saturday will force companies offering broadband and home phone deals to tell customers what they were paying on their old contract and how much their bill is going up, in a move designed to encourage users to shop around.\nIt follows research by \n which found that 20m households are no longer on their provider\u2019s initial contract \u2013 and overpaying as a result.\nCustomers who bundle their landline and broadband together \n if they are out of contract, the media regulator warned.

A family\u2019s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, \n and inheritances.\nThe report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.\nThe worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said.\nThe charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named \u201cconcealed households\u201d.\nTwenty years ago, 20% (2.4 million) of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian.

The US will push aggressively against anything that blocks American companies from doing business here, and there are few things on which the two countries are more divided than climate policy.\nThe UK has ambitious plans to \n, while the US has little policy and no targets to speak of. So the government will struggle to come to an agreement without sacrificing its already fragile climate commitments. Trade deals are increasingly about \n (a very EU-ey word) of standards and regulations to allow foreign goods and services into our borders. And it won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that alignment with the US rarely leads to stronger regulation; instead, trade agreements often act as a powerful and undemocratic tool to erode or supersede existing protections.\nThe common example is the fear of poorly checked, \n being sold in the UK. But the gulf between the US and UK on climate is even larger than on food standards. Documents from a 2018 meeting, leaked in November, set out a harsh starting position: the US will \n or include the term in any deal, which means it won\u2019t consider existing climate policies legitimate grounds for opposition to any of its demands.\nThis suggests the American negotiators will push to weaken existing low-carbon standards, or worse \u2013 given the UK has many climate targets but little actual concrete policy as yet \u2013 lock in clauses favourable to the fossil fuel industry that can\u2019t be easily overturned by domestic legislation. This would effectively head off climate policy before it can be written. A similar thing played out before negotiations when the UK was part of the EU: in the now stalled \n (TTIP), the US pushed for wording that would prevent initiatives to help renewables compete with fossil fuels. That demand is likely to be repeated, with the American fossil fuel industry keen to get fracked gas as well as \n into the UK.\nThe government\u2019s recent fracking ban could also come under pressure from US companies looking to operate here. In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation.\nPerhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an \n \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of \n under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011.\nWith an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes.\nClimate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts.

New research reveals a surge in the number of people turning to equity release in order to pay off debts and mortgages.\n is becoming an increasingly mainstream proposition, and rates on these deals have fallen to record lows, making them look more tempting. The lowest interest rates are now below 3%, whereas five years ago you would have done very well to get 5%.\nLower rates make a big difference to what you can end up owing. To give a very rough example, someone aged 71 who wants to release \u00a360,000 as a lump sum might, after 20 years, be looking at owing a total of \u00a3106,000 (the loan plus interest). That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s much less than the \u00a3166,000 that someone who was 71 in 2015 would owe after 20 years.\nHowever, these are complex products, and there are downsides.\nSo if you are an older homeowner who is short of cash, should you consider taking the plunge? Or are there better alternatives out there, such as the so-called \u201c\n\u201d (Rio) mortgages that some lenders have launched?\nEquity release is a way for older people \u2013 the minimum age is usually 55, and sometimes 60 \u2013 to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Typically there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal & General, more2life, LV= (Liverpool Victoria), Just and Canada Life. The average amount released last year was \u00a375,600, according to \n.\nBut equity release can be an expensive way to borrow. The way these schemes work means you end up paying interest on interest, so the total owed can balloon. For most, the most financially effective way of freeing up cash is to move to a smaller property or cheaper area.\nThe most common are mortgage-based products secured against your home, repaid from the sale of the property when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as lifetime mortgages and allow you to take out a loan on your property in return for a one-off lump sum or regular smaller sums.\nThese deals are becoming more flexible \u2013 a growing number include a feature called drawdown, where a pot of money is set aside for you to draw from when you need to. \nThis is popular because not everyone needs a big lump sum at the outset, and because you only pay interest on the cash you release.\nThis will vary and depend on your age, the value of your property and sometimes your health. According to the firms\u2019 website calculators, someone aged 75 with a \u00a3300,000 house could typically borrow:\n \u00a3145,500 from Just\n \u00a3145,500 from Legal & General\n \u00a3141,000 to \u00a3163,500 from more2life (depending on how healthy you are)\n \u00a3123,000 from Aviva\nAt age 85 those figures rise to \u00a3168,000 for both Just and L&G, \u00a3159,000-\u00a3163,500 for more2life, and \u00a3156,000 for Aviva.\n\u201cOver the last few years rates have fallen significantly and it is not unusual to see clients taking out products with sub-3% interest rates,\u201d says Will Hale at Key. For example, rates at more2life start at 2.67%.\nThe \n from LV= shows that 27% of customers in 2019 used equity release to clear their mortgage, loans or debts \u2013 up from 15% in 2016. Almost one in four customers (24%) used some or all the cash for home and garden improvements. Others splash out on holidays or help family and friends.\nA couple, both 71, have a \u00a3350,000 house and want to release \u00a360,000. Key looked at two scenarios for Guardian Money: releasing the cash as a lump sum or releasing an initial \u00a320,000 and withdrawing four lots of \u00a310,000 at the end of years three, five, eight and 10. These are based on an interest rate of 2.89% from more2life, available through specialist advisers.\nUnder the first scenario the amount owing \u2013 loan plus interest \u2013 would be \u00a369,000 after five years and \u00a380,000 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be \u00a3106,000.\nUnder the second scenario the amounts owed would be lower: \u00a333,000 after five years, \u00a362,000 after 10 years, and \u00a390,000 after 20 years.\nMany equity release products offer borrowers the opportunity to make interest repayments if they wish. If the couple did this, the balance outstanding would simply reflect the total sum they had borrowed on equity release, provided all monthly interest repayments had been met. At the end of 20 years, in both scenarios \u00a360,000 would be owed.\nThese are a new type of interest-only mortgage for older people. They might appeal to those put off by the idea of equity release.\nRio mortgages are effectively standard home loan deals with one big difference: the mortgage doesn\u2019t usually have a set end date and carries on until the borrower\u2019s death, or they move into a care home. Until then, the borrower continues to pay the interest each month, and the loan is ultimately repaid from the sale of their property.\nThere are now more than 70 Rio mortgage products on the market, with rates starting at 2.74% courtesy of Nationwide, according to data provider Moneyfacts.\nThe good news about Rio mortgages is that they will often work out cheaper than equity release over the longer term, according to number-crunching by financial information firm Defaqto. The bad news \u2013 apart from the fact that you must make monthly repayments \u2013 is that you have to undergo affordability tests similar to a standard mortgage, and anecdotal evidence suggests many people are failing because the tests are pretty strict.\nYou will need to show that you can afford the mortgage payments as well as all your living costs, which probably means you will need to be getting a pretty chunky pension income. For many older people that will be a tall order. Also, most Rio rates aren\u2019t fixed for life, as is the case with equity release.\nNevertheless, if you are an older borrower with a secure income, you may want to check out Rio mortgages first.\nAge UK\u2019s website, \n, has extensive information on equity release and links to advisers.

Life satisfaction steadily picked up between 2011 and 2015 as the economy recovered \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 from the deep recession that accompanied the global financial crisis and then remained steady in the second half of the 2010s.\nOne possible explanation for the drop in wellbeing is that the economy was going through a sticky patch. The economy had contracted in the second quarter of 2019 and there was an increase in the number of redundancies from 3.1 to 4.3 per 1,000 employees in the year to the third quarter. Academic studies show unemployment is an especially potent cause of unhappiness.\nAnother explanation is that by the late summer and early autumn of 2019 Britain had a serious case of the Brexit blues. It was a period during which there was a change of prime minister and parliamentary gridlock. Millions of voters \u2013 regardless of how they voted in the EU referendum \u2013 were sick of \n and wanted the subject to go away.\nEither way, calling a general election was a big gamble for Boris Johnson. It is not usually good news for governing parties when people start to feel more miserable. What\u2019s more, there was a strong argument that after calling the referendum in the first place and then making a complete horlicks of the subsequent withdrawal negotiations, the Conservatives owned Brexit.\nSo if people were fed up how come the Tories won by a landslide? In part because Johnson marketed himself as a clean break who would get Britain out of the EU. But also because Jeremy Corbyn failed to convince an uneasy country that it would be any happier under a Labour government.\nThe past decade has produced two unexpected publishing success stories. One was \n, the EL James story of how a loaded businessman satisfies his desire for kinky sex. The other was \n, an account of the other thing that turns on the rich and powerful: money.\nIf anything, Piketty\u2019s book was the greater surprise, since 800-page tomes that call for a global wealth tax do not often fly off the shelves. That, though, was back in 2013 and now the French economist is in London to publicise the English language edition of his follow-up, \n.\nThe premise of the new book is that modern capitalism is dysfunctional because it has led to much higher levels of inequality than existed 40 years ago. This has led to the rise of social tensions everywhere, but the lack of an egalitarian and universal political outlet has meant discontent with the status quo has manifested itself in rightwing nationalism.\n says it should be possible to construct a different sort of global economy \u2013 one that would redistribute the proceeds of a wealth tax through a universal capital endowment, be more inclined to restrict free movement of money rather than people, and which would have social, fiscal and environmental justice at its heart.\nAll of which sounds a tad utopian. What the book never makes clear \u2013 despite running to more than 1,000 pages \u2013 is how this kinder, gentler capitalism is going to come about.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/05/us-autonomy-mike-lynch-takeover-court": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/05/us-autonomy-mike-lynch-takeover-court", "title": "Alarm bells sound over US pursuit of Autonomy's Mike Lynch", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 07:46:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Should fallout from the takeover of a UK firm, conducted under UK rules, really end up in a US court?</p><p>Mike Lynch, in his heyday as the UK\u2019s software supremo, was a prickly character whose run-ins with City analysts were legendary.

Here\u2019s one central question: should the fallout from the takeover of a UK company, conducted under UK takeover rules, really end up in a US court?\nLynch was the founder of a UK company quoted on the London Stock Exchange. Allegations of improper accounting in the $11bn sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011 were investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office, which decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges, and Lynch has always denied any wrongdoing. Yet \n of fraud and conspiracy against Lynch relating to the deal.\nLynch \n in London on Wednesday as part of the US extradition proceedings but will fight the request under \u201cforum bar\u201d provisions, which allow a UK court to block an extradition if it deems the majority of alleged criminality took place in the UK.\nThat hearing lies ahead but, in the meantime, we are awaiting a big development: judgment in the \u00a33.8bn civil fraud trial brought against Lynch in London by Hewlett-Packard, which claims Autonomy\u2019s value was artificially inflated before the sale. The US company ended up \n.\nThe high court\u2019s verdict is critical to the wider issues. It is conceivable that Hewlett-Packard could fail to win its civil case, where the balance of probabilities is the threshold, and yet Lynch could still be sent to the US to face criminal charges with a higher burden of proof. If that were to happen, the process would look grossly unfair.\nDavid Davis, the former Brexit secretary and longstanding critic of UK-US extradition arrangements, has called the DoJ\u2019s timing \u201cextraordinarily inappropriate\u201d. Fair comment: if the roles were reversed, does anyone seriously think the UK would be able to summon a high-profile US executive in these circumstances?\nAlison Cooper exited as chief executive of FTSE 100 tobacco group Imperial Brands on Monday but her profit warnings keep coming. The group is wheezing from its big push into so-called next-generation products and group earnings will be slightly lower this year, it says. The share price, which was \u00a340 in 2016, is now \u00a318.22.\nImperial is not unique in over-promising and under-delivering on the next-gen front. The whole industry has failed to live up to its hype, especially now that the US health authorities have reacted to a vaping \u201cepidemic\u201d among children by banning some of the flavoured capsules. But Imperial\u2019s flop seem the worst of the lot.\nThe company was late to arrive in the e-cigarette market and then, having bought the Blu brand in 2015, splashed cash for little reward. The City diagnoses \u201cexecution\u201d mistakes \u2013 poor products and ineffective marketing \u2013 which explains why the board joined shareholders in \n.

When it happens, it will be time to remember Cooper once again: in her nine years in charge, the share price returned to where it started but she was paid an astonishing \u00a330m.\nThe role of chief strategy and transformation director at Marks & Spencer may sound like two jobs in one, but it will be a four-day-a-week gig for Katie Bickerstaffe, who has been summoned from the retailer\u2019s non-executive bench.\nThis corporate readiness to accept that senior jobs do not have to consume every waking hour should be applauded. The workaholic tendency is a curse on productivity and, since M&S employs a large number of part-time workers, it\u2019s helpful to send a message about a open approach to appointment.

I would have been able to take one within the music industry, alongside spending time at college learning the theory. But now there are way more options than there were back then. Deciding not to go to uni put me up against a lot of obstacles, and I doubt I would have experienced those today as apprenticeships can lead to the equivalent of a degree certificate.\nSaying that, I understand it can be hard for people \u2013 especially parents \u2013 to get their heads round. There\u2019s still a lot of stigma attached to apprenticeships, for instance there\u2019s an assumption that you can only do apprenticeships in trades like plumbing and construction, and that really needs to be reversed. My advice to parents would be to talk to your kid and work with them to figure out how they can achieve their dreams. Ask them questions, find out what inspires them, and together you can find a balance that will suit both sides. I look back and really wish I had been more open with my parents during my teens, as now I know they would have been so helpful in so many situations. University isn\u2019t the only option, so don\u2019t force your kid down that path when they could reach their full potential another way.\nAnd to any young person who doesn\u2019t think the traditional academic route is for them, take your time and research. Soak up the different cultures around you, learn what makes you tick \u2013 an apprenticeship could be the ideal route. You can work in fashion, music, law ... there are so many avenues to explore. Try one, you won\u2019t be tied down, and you never know, you might just love it.\nSo what\u2019s it actually like to embark on an apprenticeship? Lauren Franklin talks to an apprentice and his employer\nI had a place at university, but at the last minute I did a cost-benefit analysis, and the numbers didn\u2019t make sense. I knew I wanted a degree in technology, and when I saw the Accenture programme it was exactly what I needed. I get a bachelor\u2019s degree at the end of it, but I\u2019ll have no student debt and three years of great work experience.\nThere are so many! There\u2019s a wide variety of opportunities. I started in capital markets, working with investment banks, then I worked in a high street bank in Leeds, followed by a government department to help prepare for Brexit, and then an Australian insurance company. It\u2019s been so diverse, and there\u2019s a lot of room to manoeuvre.\nThere\u2019s a big support network available. We have an HR adviser, a career counsellor, an academic adviser and apprenticeship ambassadors like Neha who are there to help us with anything and everything. When you\u2019re ready for responsibility they\u2019ll give it to you. You\u2019re not just tucked away in the corner \u2013 you\u2019re allowed to flourish.\nI\u2019m from a very traditional Asian household, so you\u2019re either a lawyer, a doctor or an engineer! When I told my mum, she was a little annoyed, but accepted it. Now she\u2019s a big advocate of apprenticeships \u2013 she\u2019s telling all her friends. The older generation sometimes don\u2019t understand because the more traditional image is apprenticeships being for trades, however, there are hundreds, ranging from journalist to a nuclear missile engineer. You can even become a solicitor.\nI\u2019ve come on leaps and bounds. Confidence-wise, I never thought I\u2019d be able to serve in leadership or in strategic roles, and getting that boost helped me get rid of imposter syndrome. When you start out you have that feeling of: \u201cDo I really belong here?\u201d but everyone is so supportive and is always there to help.\nEach [apprentice] has their own career counsellor who will be there for them throughout their career here. I make sure the roles they take match with the degree course they\u2019re on, plus that they are getting the right balance with attending uni once a week. They get the support and are given a lot of space and trust to go and work.\nWith an apprenticeship, your child can establish themselves at a company while, in some cases, getting a degree. They will grow as an individual as they work in teams.

It is \u201cthe pinnacle of the \u2018gin palace\u2019 form of pub\u201d, according to its \n.\nFeatures include elaborate carvings, mahogany fireplaces, mosaic-clad bar counters and art nouvea elements, including metal gates by designer Henry Bloomfield Bare. There are also stone sculptures of musicians and musical instruments in low relief, a nod to the nearby Philharmonic Hall, as well as references to Liverpool\u2019s maritime history.\nThe gentlemen\u2019s toilets also survive from its original Victorian design, the imitation marble urinals proving one of the most Instagrammed conveniences in the UK. The ladies\u2019 loos are somewhat less stunning: they were added some years after the pub opened, being superfluous in what started life as a men-only establishment.\nThe Beatles used to drink at the \u201cPhil\u201d in their early years and \n.\nTwo other Liverpool pubs have also had their listings upgraded. The Vines on Lime Street, another Thomas design, is now Grade II* listed, thanks to its opulent Edwardian interior, featuring rich, original mahogany woodwork and plasterwork, and a large stained-glass dome in the former billiards room. The separate lounge bar, public bar and smoke room survive in good condition, as do a number of striking fireplaces. The rather eccentric \n, named after its landlord and inventor, includes various unique features including carved \u2018corbels\u2019 (wall brackets) thought to be caricatures of the pub\u2019s regulars, and original tables designed by Kavanagh, with channels for spilt drinks and in-built ash trays.\nHistoric England is working with the Campaign for Real Ale pub heritage group to protect the best pubs for the nation. Together they have so far given 51 pubs a Grade I listing \u2013 but none of those began life as a \u201cpub\u201d in the modern sense in the same way as the Philharmonic.\nAlthough the term \u201cpublic house\u201d can be traced back to the 1600s, the \u201cpub\u201d as a distinct building type emerged in the mid-1800s. It brought together and developed three earlier types of building \u2013\u00a0the inn, tavern and alehouse.\nThere are examples of Grade I listed inns which include the late 15\n century \n (Glastonbury) and the 17th century \n (Southwark). \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/06/will-hs2-really-benefit-the-north": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/06/will-hs2-really-benefit-the-north", "title": "Will HS2 really benefit the north?", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 03:00:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the government prepares to give the green light to a new high-speed rail line between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, Helen Pidd looks at the dire state of transport links in the north of England.

By the end of 2021, its orbit will have an inclination of 17\u00b0 \u2013 high enough to take images of the sun\u2019s extremities \u2013 and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33\u00b0.\nComputational models and magnetic field measurements suggest that the sun\u2019s poles could be dominated by huge coronal holes \u2013 areas of the surface that are less dense than their surroundings and will show up as ominous dark pools.\n\u201cThese coronal holes are enormous at the poles. We\u2019ll be able to peer over the edges \u2026 and see how it grows and shrinks with solar activity\u201d, said Nicola Fox, director of Nasa\u2019s heliophysics division. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve never been able to do before.\u201d\nStriking geometric features are also a possibility, according to McCaughrean. The first images of Jupiter\u2019s north pole surprised astronomers with an \n of storms twirling like cogs around a central vortex, while Saturn\u2019s north pole features a \n.\nThe $1.3bn mission will run parallel to \n, launched 18 months ago, which has flown closer to the sun than any spacecraft, and the \n, which has acquired the highest resolution images of the solar surface since it began observations in December. \nAt just 3.83 million miles from the solar surface \u2013 technically inside the sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 Parker will be seven times closer to the Sun than Solar Orbiter. But, McCaughrean points out, Parker will not be taking any direct images because if it looked at the sun, it would melt. From its slightly less scorching vantage point, Solar Orbiter will be able to make long-range observations of surface features such as sun spots as well as detecting the solar wind streaming past.\n\u201cWe always wanted to make this seeing and feeling connection. The stuff that you can see at the surface you can feel going past a few days later\u201d, said McCaughrean. \u201cParker is out there going \u2018Ooh, I\u2019m feeling stuff but I\u2019ve got no idea where it came from\u2019.\u201d\nSolar Orbiter\u2019s camera and other instruments are housed behind a heat shield, peering out through shuttered peepholes that close whenever the probe\u2019s interior gets too hot. The titanium shield is coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones, something Esa concluded was uniquely well-suited to keeping the craft at a stable temperature throughout the mission.\nThe probe\u2019s orbit, which at times will move almost in synch with the sun\u2019s own rotation, will allow it to track sun spots on the solar surface as they appear and vanish, and will investigate the origins of the solar wind as it streams off the sun.\nThe mission will also use helioseismology \u2013 measurements of small and large scale oscillations at the sun\u2019s surface \u2013 to try and unravel the sun\u2019s internal structure. The sun\u2019s acoustic \u201cringing\u201d can also reveal sun spots bubbling up from the interior days before they appear as darkened patches on the surface.\nSolar Orbiter is scheduled to begin making science measurements in May, with full operations starting in November 2021, when the probe\u2019s telescopes switch on.\n\u201cIt will capture the imagination like science fiction does and inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers,\u201d said Yannis Zouganelis, Esa\u2019s deputy project scientist for Solar Orbiter.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/dominic-raab-urges-britons-china-leave-coronavirus-outbreak": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/dominic-raab-urges-britons-china-leave-coronavirus-outbreak", "title": "Coronavirus crisis: Raab urges Britons to leave China", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 19:51:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>UK citizens should leave \u2018if they can\u2019 to reduce risk of exposure to virus, says foreign secretary</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/stay-or-go-britons-in-china-weigh-up-coronavirus-risks\">Stay or go?

One told the Guardian: \u201cFor many of us this has put us in an impossible position. It\u2019s all a bit of a shocker really.\u201d \nThe foreign secretary, \n, said in a statement: \u201cWe now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. \u201d\nOn Tuesday night he confirmed that the Foreign Office would charter another flight on Sunday to help people out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, earlier accused the government of abandoning Britons. \u201cFrom the very start of this outbreak, the government\u2019s response has been a total shambles, and now they appear to be telling British nationals in China simply to fend for themselves in terms of getting out of the country,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed. The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens, at home and abroad, and Boris Johnson is manifestly failing to do that.\u201d\nRobin Mitchell, a 38-year-old lecturer in Xiamen, Fujian province, who has a six-year-old daughter with his Chinese partner, described the news as \u201cabout as far from reassuring as possible\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cFor most expats, leaving China is not like cutting a holiday short. We have jobs, houses, pets and, most importantly of all, family here. I, and presumably hundreds or possibly thousands like me, have a child with a Chinese partner, which complicates matters even further as visa applications take months.\n\u201cSince the outbreak the consulate has not made any attempt to contact any expat I know and appears to have completely jumped ship.\u201d\nDowning Street said British nationals who wanted to return from China should follow the advice and precautions of the commercial airlines they flew on in relation to the coronavirus. \n\u201cWhere British nationals can leave the country they should do so, given the risk that travel restrictions may increase,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said.\nMore than 400 people have now died in the outbreak, and China has increased the number of cities on lockdown. The country\u2019s leadership admitted \u201cshortcomings\u201d in its handling of the virus.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency, with at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions. There have been 20,000 cases in China.\nSo far two people have \n. The patients, who are members of the same family and believed to be Chinese nationals, are receiving specialist care at the Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases Centre in Newcastle\u2019s Royal Victoria infirmary.\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he expected further cases as the global community worked to stop the rapid spread of the virus. Speaking before a meeting on Tuesday with his German counterpart, Jens Spahn, Hancock said the UK was working with other countries to research a vaccine.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the peak of the coronavirus by a long stretch and we expect more cases in the UK,\u201d Hancock said.\nSpahn said it was important that the UK and EU continue to cooperate, regardless of their future relationship. He said: \u201cThe virus obviously knows no borders and is a threat to all our citizens. What\u2019s important for the international community is to join forces when it comes to research, when it comes to detecting the virus and combating it.\u201d\nChina\u2019s \n is running at 2.1%, while in Hubei province, which accounts for 97% of all fatalities, the rate is 3%. China\u2019s national health commission said 80% of deaths were among people over the age of 60, and 75% had underlying conditions.\nTens of thousands of British nationals in China work across professions from business and consultancy to academia and medicine. They include executives at international companies and entrepreneurs who have set up their own companies in the country, teachers at prestigious international schools and English-language teachers at Chinese schools.\nThere are also academics, journalistsand doctors working at international hospitals, many language students and some university students studying at Chinese institutions. If they want to leave, many will have to break contracts, leave behind businesses, abandon studies and take children out of school.\nAny exodus would have inevitable knock-on effects for Chinese citizens who work for or with British nationals, take classes from them or rely on them for medical care or other services. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/07/cosmic-ray-research-station-mount-aragats-photo-essay": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/07/cosmic-ray-research-station-mount-aragats-photo-essay", "title": "'We're above civilisation': life in a cosmic ray station \u2013 photo essay", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 07:27:54 GMT", "summary": "<p>Cut off during winter, a former Soviet weapons research facility high up on Mount Aragats, Armenia is now part of a network of sites around the world studying the mysterious particles</p><p>The cosmic ray research station on Mount Aragats sits at an altitude of 3,200 metres.

Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.\nArshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.\nArriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.\nTechnicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.\nInside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.\nHovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.\nThe confusingly named \u201crays\u201d are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.\nWhen they meet the Earth\u2019s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed\nfor corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.\nThe particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.\nHigh-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth\u2019s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.\nThe Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.\nAs well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes\nin radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.\nSoviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.\nDotted around the centre, \u201cscintillators\u201d record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.\nAlthough Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.\nJabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is \u201cwhen the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month\u201d. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: \u201cWe\u2019re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there\u2019s nothing to disturb them.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2020/feb/06/can-we-predict-the-weather-in-space": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2020/feb/06/can-we-predict-the-weather-in-space", "title": "What's the weather like in space?

Five minutes later, they vanished.\nLater that night, bright aurora lit the Earth\u2019s sky as far south as Havana and Honolulu. Around the world, telegraph communications failed, some of them bursting into flames.\nCarrington had observed a billion tonnes of plasma being lifted off the sun\u2019s surface and accelerated into space at more than 1,300 times the speed of sound. While most such events miss the Earth, this was a direct hit. The so called \u201cCarrington Event\u201d created the largest geomagnetic storm in recorded history.\nSolar activity of this magnitude is, thankfully, rare. Analysis of ice core samples suggest the storm of 1859 may have been the fiercest in 500 years.\nBut what if it were to happen again?\nThe impact on today\u2019s far more technology dependent society could be more serious. That\u2019s why governments around the world are paying increasing attention to \u201cspace weather\u201d.\nNot to be confused with weather on Earth, space weather is concerned with the environmental conditions in near-Earth space caused by magnetic fields, radiation and matter ejected from the sun.\nLast month, the US House science, space and technology committee approved a bill to prioritise investment in space weather forecasting. While the UK government has also developed a detailed strategy to prepare for severe space weather.\nBut there is a lot we don\u2019t yet know. It\u2019s difficult to predict space weather events with accuracy \u2013 and with more than 160 years of technological advancement since the Carrington Event, there\u2019s no way to know what the impact on modern society would be.\nTo help answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at the source of space weather: the sun.\nIn 2018, Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe, venturing closer than any previous mission to study the sun\u2019s atmosphere or corona.\nOn 9 February the \n will launch its own mission, the Solar Orbiter, to further expand our knowledge of the sun and space weather. It will use the gravity of Venus to help get into orbit around the sun. The Solar Orbiter will not get as close as Nasa\u2019s probe but will be able to look directly at the sun.\nOf the many innovations onboard the Solar Orbiter, one of the most interesting is the heat shield. Its outermost layer will be lined with a material called \u201csolar black\u201d \u2013 a type of black calcium phosphate processed from burnt bone charcoal.\nBurnt char bone has an ancient legacy. Our prehistoric ancestors would use it, along with wooden charcoal, as a black pigment. The survival of some cave paintings after thousands of years is a testament to the material\u2019s endurance.\nRemote-sensing instruments onboard the Solar Orbiter will observe the sun through tiny sliding doors in the shield, while other instruments will measure the conditions around the spacecraft. Together, they will allow the craft to investigate the three most common types of solar activity that drive space weather:\nSolar flares are sudden flashes of increased brightness but most of their energy is invisible to the naked eye, consisting of intense bursts of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.\nIf directed at the earth, solar flares disrupt radio communications. The X-rays can also heat the outer atmosphere, causing low-orbiting satellites to lose altitude.\nSolar flares are a particular concern for human missions to the moon, Mars or beyond. For example, if Apollo 17 had launched just a few months earlier, it may have encountered the solar storm of August 1972, potentially exposing the three astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation.\nScientists have a good idea of how solar flares get their energy and we know that they occur near sunspots. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood and current methods of flare prediction are limited. There is currently no way of knowing when any given region of the sun will produce a flare.\nMuch like a giant particle accelerator, the sun sometimes shoots off storms of high energy protons and electrons into space.\nTravelling at close to the speed of light, these solar energetic particles can reach the Earth within an hour, penetrating the protective layers of our magnetic field and sometimes even reaching the surface.\nIf they were to strike the Earth, electronics onboard planes would be damaged and air travellers would be exposed to increased doses of radiation.\nPerhaps the most concerning element of solar activity, coronal mass ejections are eruptions on the surface of the sun that cause large parts of the corona to blast away.\nThey are slower than solar flares or energetic particles, taking between one and four days to reach Earth. But when they do, they create a geomagnetic storm which, much like a spring, compresses one side of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere while extending the other. When the spring adjusts, this \u201ctension\u201d is directed back into the upper atmosphere.\nCoronal mass ejections can produce mass power outages and failure of telecommunication services, including GPS. The insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London estimates that in a worst-case scenario, it could leave 20 to 40 million people in the north-eastern US without power, perhaps for years.\nEach of these phenomena can occur in isolation or in combination. On that morning in 1859, Carrington observed all three: a perfect solar storm.\nWhat are the chances it could happen again? The estimates vary. Some reports have suggested the likelihood may be as high as 12% in the next decade. However, more recent studies have put forward a more conservative estimate of between 0.46% and 1.88%.\nIn the grand scheme of global risks, weather in space may be considered less of a threat to our safety than the weather on Earth. Nonetheless, the importance of Esa\u2019s Solar Orbiter is not to be underestimated. It will answer important questions that will help us not only to prepare for severe space weather but also better understand the sun and its impact on our lives.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds", "title": "Scientists in Israel grow date plants from 2,000-year-old seeds", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:00:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>Seeds found in Judean desert are male and female, leading to hopes of producing dates</p><p>A handful of date seeds from fruit that ripened around the time of Jesus have been successfully planted and grown in southern Israel, researchers have revealed.</p><p>The seeds, dubbed Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith and Hannah, were among many others discovered at archaeological sites in the Judean desert.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "A handful of date seeds from fruit that ripened around the time of Jesus have been successfully planted and grown in southern \n, researchers have revealed.\nThe seeds, dubbed Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith and Hannah, were among many others discovered at archaeological sites in the Judean desert.\nIt is not the first time the team have managed to grow ancient seeds: \n that they had germinated a 1,900-year-old Judean date palm seed from Masada \u2013 an ancient site extended by Herod the Great in the first century BC that looks out over the Dead Sea. That plant, a male, was named Methuselah after the oldest character in the Bible.\nBut the new study goes further \u2013 not only involving more seeds, but shedding light on the way Judean farmers may have cultivated the famous plants.\nAnd with the newly germinated seeds including females, the discovery could bear further fruit: the team say they hope to apply Methuselah\u2019s pollen to Hannah \u2013 which is expected to produce a flower within the next two years \u2013 with the goal of producing dates.\nBut it may not quite be a resurrection.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be the typical Judean date, because dates that were grown at that time \u2013 just like dates that are grown today \u2013 are not grown from seeds that somebody puts in the earth,\u201d said Dr Sarah Sallon, director of the Louis Borick Natural Medicine Research Centre at the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem. \u201cThey are grown from clones from very high-producing females.\u201d\nDate palms are thought to have first been cultivated in Arabia and Mesopotamia (now Iraq) more than 6,000 years ago and were once widespread in ancient Judea, a region of the Levant. As well as being an important item of food, said Sallon, they were used to treat various medical conditions, including depression and poor memory. \u201cDates were an enormous export from Judea and they were famous,\u201d she said.\nWriters from Pliny the Elder to Herodotus raved about the qualities of Judean dates, including their long shelf-life, which allowed them to be transported far and wide. \u201cHerod even used to present them to the emperor in Rome every year,\u201d said Sallon.\nBut the plants suffered under centuries of unrest; by the 19th century the plantations had disappeared.\n, Sallon and colleagues report how they planted 32 Judean date palm seeds retrieved from a variety of archaeological sites across the Judean desert. These include Masada and caves at Qumran \u2013 shelters best known for concealing the Dead Sea scrolls but which were also used by refugees in ancient times.\n\u201cI spent hours and hours in the archaeology department picking through the best seeds,\u201d said Sallon. \u201cA lot of them had holes in where insects had bored through or [they had] fallen apart, but some were really pristine and I picked the very best ones.\u201d\nSix of the seeds sprouted. The team radiocarbon-dated fragments of the shells left after germination to reveal that Hannah and Adam date to somewhere between the first and fourth centuries BC.

It is the first time this pattern has been shown outside primates.\n\u201cWe can probably find many other species that conform to these laws because this is probably a general principle, rather than something related to human language specifically,\u201d said Dr Livio Favaro, a co-author of the research now at the University of Turin.\nProf Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton, who was not involved in the work but has previously conducted similar research in non-human primates, said the new study adds weight to the idea that animals tend to convey information in the most efficient way. Such an approach is known as \u201ccompression\u201d and is also seen in systems such as morse code where the most commonly used letters have the simplest and shortest sounds \u2013 either a dot or a dash.\n\u201cIf you have compression in the communication system it is more efficient,\u201d said Semple. \u201cSo it is the sort of thing that evolution will have acted on because animals that communicate efficiently are expending less energy.\u201d\n, Favaro and colleagues describe how they analysed 590 vocalisations recorded from 28 adult African penguins \u2013 also known as jackass penguins because of their distinctive sound \u2013 that live in Italian zoos.\nThese vocalisations were so-called \u201cecstatic display songs\u201d \u2013 calls, typically uttered by males, that communicate an individual\u2019s identity, tell rivals that territory is taken, and help the birds bag a mate.\nThese songs are made up of sequences of three distinctive types of sound \u2013 or syllables. \nThe team say the findings suggests the penguins\u2019 songs follow two laws seen across a wide range of human languages as well as some, but not all, non-human primates \u2013 Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law.\nThe former states that the more often a sound is used the shorter it is \u2013 in English, for example, the most common words include \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cto\u201d and \u201cof\u201d \u2013 while the latter says that the longer a unit of language the shorter the components within it: for example cumbersome words tend to contain shorter syllables than simple ones. \n\u201cOne-syllable words can be very long, like \u2018strength\u2019, but many-syllable words tend to have short syllables, like \u2018pa-ra-me-ter-ise\u2019,\u201d said Prof Chris Kello, an expert in modelling language patterns at the University of California, Merced who was not involved in the latest research.\nWhile the new study has limitations \u2013 including that it only looked at one form of vocalisation among the penguins \u2013 Favaro said the study shows the linguistic laws are not about language per se, as they are not linked to semantics or syntax, but are rooted more in a fundamental principle of sharing information efficiently. What\u2019s more, he added, the research reveals the interplay of different evolutionary pressures, such as the need to convey the size of the animal and its identity, all while communicating efficiently.\nKello welcomed the study. \u201cLinguistic laws, like Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law, were originally discovered in text,\u201d he said, noting that meant it was initially thought that they arose from the symbolic nature of human language.\n\u201cThis new study provides more evidence that the laws are physical and not symbolic, because even penguins show them. Instead, the laws seem to reflect something deeper and more general about communication and information.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/coronavirus-economic-impact-australia-could-be-among-worlds-hardest-hit-nations": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/coronavirus-economic-impact-australia-could-be-among-worlds-hardest-hit-nations", "title": "Coronavirus economic impact: Australia could be among world's hardest hit nations", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 19:00:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>Australia\u2019s economy is unusually dependent on China, and a coronavirus-driven slowdown could mean billions in lost revenue</p><p>Australia could be one of the countries worst affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak as factories in China remain shuttered and millions of people are confined to their homes and banned from travelling.</p><p>The Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday stuck to its forecast of strong growth this year thanks to a rising housing market, and the stock market \u2013 along with others around the world \u2013 has largely shrugged off concerns about the global impact of the virus to remain close to all-time highs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/coronavirus-economic-impact-australia-could-be-among-worlds-hardest-hit-nations\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Australia could be one of the countries worst affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak as factories in \n remain shuttered and millions of people are confined to their homes and banned from travelling.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday stuck to its forecast of strong growth this year thanks to a rising housing market, and the stock market \u2013 along with others around the world \u2013 has largely shrugged off concerns about the global impact of the virus to remain close to all-time highs.\nBut evidence is mounting that China is suffering a significant slowdown. \n for the world\u2019s second biggest economy to 5% this year from 5.75%, predicting that the impact would spread around the world, while it seems clear that China\u2019s lockdown is set to deprive Australia of billions of dollars in revenue from big spending tourists and students.\nThe standstill, typified by Toyota\u2019s announcement on Friday that it is keeping its 12 factories in China shut for another week, is alarming investors such as Damien Klassen, who manages millions of dollars for Melbourne-based Nucleus Wealth.\n\u201cWhen you look at how this will affect other countries, what their exposure is to China, how big the economy is, what type of companies it has, then Australia ticks a lot of the boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of which countries will be most affected, we\u2019re right up there.\u201d\nAlex Joiner, economist at IFM Investors in Melbourne, also sees a growing risk for Australia despite the optimistic forecasts from the RBA governor, Phillip Lowe, that the economy \n.\nThe threat from the Chinese lockdown to tourism alone is very significant, Joiner says. China provides around 15-16% of visitors to Australia but they are the biggest contributors to the Australian bottom line when they are here, outspending American tourists by a ratio of three to one. Their spending of $12-16bn is greater than American, British, Japanese and New Zealand tourists put together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the numbers of tourists \u2013 it\u2019s that they spend quite a lot because of the way they travel with packages, how they get around and spending on shopping,\u201d he says. \u201cIf that gets cut off it\u2019s a material impact on the economy in Australia.\u201d\nThe education sector \u2013 at $34bn, revenue from overseas students is \n \u2013 is also crucial, and again highlights how exposed Australia is if students cannot leave China to start their courses this month.\nThe ratings agency Moody\u2019s said on Friday that Australian universities will be harder hit than those of any other country because of the relatively high proportion of international students, one quarter of whom are from China.\nJoiner says that while mining might suffer in the short term \u2013 China declared force majeure on LNG shipments on Friday \u2013 it is likely to benefit from the stimulus measures Beijing is expected to use to kickstart things once the contagion ends.\nBut the service sector is different. \u201cYou can\u2019t give stimulus to people to go overseas,\u201d he says, \u201cand you\u2019ve got tourist destinations like Australia that now have restrictions on visitors.\u201d\nEconomists at JP Morgan \n that the coronavirus outbreak has \u201ccompletely changed the dynamics of the Chinese economy\u201d, although they agree with most experts that it is too early to forecast exactly what is going to happen.\nHowever, some partial data released on Friday suggests the scale of the problem that is emerging, with figures showing that property sales in China\u2019s so-called first-tier cities fell by 93% on 3-5 February compared with the same days last year. Railway passenger traffic was down 89% on 5 February.\nSo as well as the factory shutdown, Klassen points to the closure of many schools until the end of the month as a sign of paralysis and says that the resumption of normal activities involving large gatherings of people such as eating out, or going to the cinema and sporting events, seems unlikely for weeks or even months.\nThe global impact could be much greater than many expect and possibly even provide the kind of \n that could trigger a slump after the long boom enjoyed since 2009.\n\u201cThe economic impact might be enough to force the world economy into recession,\u201d he says, dismissing the prediction by Chinese officials on Friday that the economy will bounce back as it did after the Sars outbreak in 2003.\n\u201cPeople say it will be like Sars \u2026 But the Chinese economy was a quarter of the size back then. Hyundai saying this week they can\u2019t make cars any more [at its giant Ulsan plant in South Korea] because they haven\u2019t got any parts \u2013 that didn\u2019t happen back then.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pulled back all our holdings.

But it\u2019s still not clear which animal is the missing link.\nFontanet believes the intermediary was \u201cprobably a mammal,\u201d possibly belonging to the badger family.\nAfter testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists at the South China Agricultural University found that the genome sequences of viruses in pangolins to be 99% identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nBut other experts urged caution. \u201cThis is not scientific evidence,\u201d said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. \u201cInvestigations into animal reservoirs are extremely important, but results must be then be published for international scrutiny.\u201d\n\u201cSimply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient,\u201d he added.\nTo conclusively identify the culprit, researchers would need to test each species that was on sale at the market \u2013 a near impossibility given that it is now permanently closed.\nMartine Peeters, a virologist at France\u2019s Institute for Research and Development (IRD), was part of the team that identified the host animal of the Ebola virus during recent epidemics.\nThey found that it was indeed a bat that passed the virus on to humans, and Peeters believes that is likely to be the case this time around. During her Ebola research, \u201cwe collected thousands of bat dropping from several sites in Africa,\u201d Peeters told AFP.\nFontanet said that the Chinese are carrying out research now.\n\u201cThey say they\u2019ve analysed samples from a rubbish truck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t say which, but I think it\u2019s likely to have been excrement that was just lying around.\u201d\nWhile it may be too late for this outbreak, identifying the carrier animal for the novel coronavirus could prove vital in preventing future flare-ups.\nChina, for example, outlawed the sale of civet for food during the Sars epidemic.\nEric Leroy, a virologist and vet at the IRD said that the search could well turn up a result quickly, as with Sars. Equally, it could take years. \u201cWith Ebola, research started in 1976 and we didn\u2019t see the first results published until 2005,\u201d he told AFP.\nOne determining factor could be what percentage of the same species are infected. \u201cIf that\u2019s low, less than 1% for example, that\u2019s obviously going to lower the chance you stumble upon an infected animal,\u201d said Leroy.\nFor Fontanet, coronavirus is just the latest example of the potentially disastrous consequence of humans consuming virus-carrying wild animals. He said that China needed to \u201ctake pretty radical measures against the sale of wild animals in markets\u201d.\nBeijing has prohibited the practice, but only moved to do so last month, when the outbreak was already out of control.\n\u201cEach time, we try to put out the fire, and once it\u2019s out we await the next one,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Renaud, a researcher at the Paris-based National Centre for Scientific Research.\nHe recommended compiling a watch list of all animals that could potentially transmit viruses to humans. \u201cYou need to see epidemics before they come, and therefore you need to be proactive,\u201d he said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/what-is-coronavirus-wuahn-china-outbreak-doctor": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/what-is-coronavirus-wuahn-china-outbreak-doctor", "title": "What is coronavirus and how worried should we be?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:41:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Find all our coronavirus coverage here</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/how-does-coronavirus-spread-and-how-can-you-protect-yourself\">How to protect yourself from infection</a></li></ul><p>It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.\nNew and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\nThe virus causes \n. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\nHuman to human transmission has been confirmed by China\u2019s national health commission, and there have been human-to-human transmissions in the US and \n. As of 7 February, the death toll stands at 636 inside China, one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. Infections inside China stand at 31,161 and global infections have passed 280 in 28 countries. The mortality rate is 2%.\nTwo members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and \n, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can.\nThe number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by \n (WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.\nWe don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about \n each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\nAnother key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\nUnless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The \n that people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP\u2019s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.\n experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has \n of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease.

According to \n, registrations of French bulldogs alone has risen from 1,521 in 2009 to 36,785 in 2018. Over the same period, the use of artificial insemination in dogs has also risen.\nNow an investigation \n has found there are currently at least 37 canine fertility clinics in the UK \u2013 as discovered through internet searching. In 2015, a \n on a clinic suggested the existence of such a facility was noteworthy and unusual. That, they say, suggests there has been a rise in such clinics.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be 100% sure but it seems highly likely that this is fuelled by demand for flat-faced dogs,\u201d said Josh Loeb, a reporter and co-author of the investigation for the Vet Record. \n\u201cThere has been rising public demand for these dogs, and these breeds tend to need human assistance in order to be able to breed,\u201d he said.\nThe report reveals that 20 of the clinics offered flat-faced dogs as studs, while examination of the websites by the Guardian found many illustrated with images of such breeds. Indeed, some clinics appear to be entirely devoted to brachycephalic dogs. \nServices on offer range from artificial insemination to ultrasound scans, sperm motility testing, microchipping, progesterone testing and, in some cases, caesarean sections.\nLoeb and colleagues found some of these clinics are linked to veterinary surgeries, while others are run through basic websites with limited contact details.\nThe researchers say the findings raise several concerns. Some procedures can only be carried out by a vet, including caesarean sections and artificial insemination involving \n. Loeb and colleagues note that while it is possible clinics without a vet may hire one for such procedures, it is not clear whether they do so.\nWhat\u2019s more, the team found two clinics advertising an invasive form of artificial insemination that was banned in the UK last year. Upon contacting the clinics, they were told the website information was incorrect and would be removed.\nLoeb said the findings raise questions, including whether anyone is monitoring what happens in such clinics.\n\u201cUnlike businesses that breed and sell dogs, those offering stud dogs, canine artificial insemination and ultrasound scans do not require a licence to operate,\u201d the report notes. \u201cThey are not generally regulated unless they offer services that are clearly acts of veterinary surgery.\u201d\n that breeding flat-faced dogs using artificial insemination and caesareans may even be unlawful, pointing to regulations that say dogs should not be kept for breeding if their genes or other traits suggest breeding would harm the health or welfare of the parent or offspring.\n \u201cThere are lots of procedures that can be done to animals that are banned, because they are seen as mutilations because they are purely for aesthetic purposes,\u201d Loeb told the Guardian. \u201cIf you think about it, this is another example of that.\u201d\nBut Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said artificial insemination is now used for many breeds and can bring genetic benefits, while non-vets can be very skilled in aspects of canine fertility that can be practised without veterinary qualifications. Professional support, he added, can help inexperienced breeders ensure safety and good conditions.\n\u201cWhere veterinary procedures are not involved then sometimes you can get extremely experienced people who are not vets but they are maybe more experienced in certain areas,\u201d he said. \nDaniella Dos Santos, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the organisation was deeply concerned about the advertising of banned procedures, adding that while other forms of artificial insemination are allowed and important for breeding, a vet should be involved in their use.\nThat said, she stressed, the process is not suitable for all dogs \u2013 including those who cannot mate or give birth naturally.\n\u201cWe would be concerned about artificial insemination being used in such cases, or to allow dogs with inherited diseases and conditions, for example brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome in flat-faced dogs, to be used for breeding,\u201d she said. \u201cVets will often recommend that these dogs are neutered.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia", "title": "Concerns coronavirus is going undetected in Indonesia", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:53:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>World\u2019s fourth most populous country says it has no confirmed cases despite close links to China</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-live-updates-in-china-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-cruise-ship-doctor-japan\">Coronavirus - latest updates</a></li></ul><p>There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China.</p><p>As of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in \n, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China.\nAs of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested.\nMore than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally.

But it points to the possibility that those at risk could be spotted far earlier.\nThe study revealed that about half of the earliest mutations occurred in just nine genes, meaning there is a relatively small pool of common genes that serve as triggers for cells to diverge from healthy development to a path towards cancer. It might be possible, in future, to pick up such mutations using so-called liquid biopsies \u2013 genetic tests that detect mutations in free-floating DNA carried in the blood that can indicate the presence of tumours elsewhere in the body.\n\u201cOne could try and identify these [early mutations] and do some kind of very sensitive imaging on patients that were positive,\u201d said Van Loo. \u201cOr even further into the future, one could conceive of methods that really targeted these cells and made them light up in an imaging approach or just kill them in one go. That\u2019s a bit science fiction at the moment.\u201d\nAbout 363,000 new cancer cases are reported in the UK every year, according to Cancer Research UK, with the disease causing 165,000 deaths annually.\nThe team analysed and sequenced nearly 2,700 whole genomes of cancer samples and mapped mutations in 38 different types of tumours.\nWhile human cells undergo billions of mutations, only a small number of them, called driver mutations, give rise to cancer. The researchers looked at how many times a single change, or driver mutation, had been replicated and copied across chromosomes.\nUsing what they describe as a \u201ccarbon-dating method\u201d, they were able to reconstruct the order in which the genomes of cancer cells started to accumulate errors and eventually carry large segments that had been scrambled or copied. The team found that these mutations occurred \u201cparticularly early\u201d in ovarian cancer as well as in two types of brain tumour, glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.\nThe analysis is published in \n as part of a wider collection of 22 papers from the Pan-Cancer project.\nPrevious research on cancer genetics has focused on the so-called coding regions of the genome, which contain the instructions for cells to make proteins.\nLincoln Stein, of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Canada, who is also a member of the Pan-Cancer project steering committee, said: \u201cThe vast majority of work so far has been on the protein coding portion of the genome. That\u2019s a mere 1%. It\u2019s like trying to put together a 100,000-piece jigsaw puzzle when you\u2019re missing 99% of the pieces and there\u2019s no puzzle box with a completed picture to guide you.\u201d\nThe latest research provides some of the first detailed insights into the role of the other 99% of our DNA \u2013 the genome\u2019s \u201cdark matter\u201d \u2013 and how these less-studied regions contribute to cancer. The study identifies several important genes that lie outside the coding region. Stein said these newly identified genes would increase the proportion of patients for whom a cancer-causing mutation could be pinpointed from about two-thirds to 95%.\n\u201cPrior to that, we would be in the dark about roughly one-third of patients that came into the clinic,\u201d Stein added.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/how-to-write-perfect-to-do-list": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/how-to-write-perfect-to-do-list", "title": "What a to-do!

She doesn\u2019t like calling them \u201cto-do lists\u201d. \u201cI refer to them as action lists,\u201d she says. To create an effective action list, fill it with things on which you will truly take action; don\u2019t create a giant inventory of random, and perhaps unimportant, tasks.\nList a maximum of 10 tasks for the day. \u201cRealistically, how much can you fit in? It might be five or six things, or only one. Identify the most important thing you need to do today and how long each task is going to take.\u201d Know that you will almost certainly underestimate this. \u201cAllocate time in the day when you\u2019re going to do it,\u201d says Evans. \nEvans\nrecommends tackling the task you are least looking forward to first. Roy Baumeister, a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and the co-author of \n, advises including \u201csome easy things as well as the harder ones. You can start right away on a couple of easy ones, get those out of the way, and have a good feeling of making progress. But given that willpower is limited, you should not squander it all on the easy ones \u2013 treat those as warm-ups.\u201d Tasks should be specific and small, he says. \u201cRather than \u2018clean out and paint garage\u2019, maybe start with \u2018buy paint\u2019 and \u2018fill one trash barrel\u2019, and so on.\u201d\nIdeally, says Morgenstern, you wouldn\u2019t keep a to-do list at all \u2013 \u201cyour to-dos should be integrated into your calendar immediately. It enables you to account for and plan your days realistically. For every to-do, how long is it going to take and when are you going to do it? Wednesday morning? Saturday afternoon? Then you have no list, but a plan.\u201d\nThat said, it is helpful to keep a master list somewhere, to capture every looming task, she says. Morganstern recommends sub-dividing it to avoid chaos or feeling overwhelmed. \u201cIt could be work versus home life. Within your work, it could be administrative, writing, marketing and team tasks.\u201d\nThis should help with working through them \u2013 once you have scheduled them. \u201cWe should execute by category \u2013 batch processing. Do all your financial stuff at one time, all your marketing stuff, all your people stuff. That\u2019s a more efficient way to operate than switching back and forth.\u201d\nOnce you have completed some tasks that you had been putting off, should you give yourself a reward? These can be useful \u201cif there are things you don\u2019t like to do and need to motivate yourself to do,\u201d says Morgenstern. But for most tasks the satisfaction of getting something done \u2013 and the freedom from that nagging feeling \u2013 is more than enough. \u201cI think getting to-dos done is the reward for most people. People crave accomplishment.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government", "title": "This is the age of the megafire \u2013 and it\u2019s being fuelled by our leaders | Tim Flannery", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>In the face of the climate disaster it helped create, the Australian government has given us only lies and denial</p><p>Unprecedented wildfires have recently devastated California, the Amazon, southern Europe, Siberia and Australia.

Like all good predators, it remains hidden until it\u2019s ready to strike, so even in this fire-plagued year, most Australians have not seen the flames that lurk in the forest, taking life seemingly at random. But many have smelt its stench. Sometimes we wake at night to thickening smoke, and lie there wondering where the beast is prowling. Some mornings we peer out the window and decide that it is not a safe day to be outside.\nThis year fire struck Australia when its guard was down, trapping tens of thousands of people while they were enjoying their summer vacations. The sight of Australians disembarking from warships on naval regulation gangways reminded us that, in this new Australia, the fiery beast that lurks in the forest can make anyone a temporary climate refugee.\nIncreasingly, Australian fire harasses its victims for weeks or months before striking. You prepare for its onslaught, only for the flames to turn aside at the last moment. You prepare the buckets, hoses and other equipment again and again, while fire weakens you with its smoke and debilitating heat. It can also trap you, as if you\u2019re a mouse in a corner. You wait, with fire all around, and all exits cut, your fate in the hands of the wind. If you are lucky enough to survive, you can remain trapped for weeks as you wait for roads to be cleared and made safe.\nWhen the predator finally does pounce, it does so with extraordinary fickleness. One house is left standing, while all around are smouldering ashes; one fire truck is picked up by a fire tornado and overturned, while nearby no wind is felt. Why me, both the fortunate and unfortunate ask?\nThe psychological impact of such experiences is profound. I\u2019ve lost a house to bushfire, and successfully defended another. When I look into the eyes of the fire-hunted, I see the same expression I\u2019ve seen in the eyes of returned soldiers or traumatised refugees. Bushfire triggers a primeval fear, one that has been plaguing our ancestors since the first ape was plucked from its family, carried away and consumed by a big cat.\nFew things matter as much to Australians as their homes and communities. More than \n have been destroyed so far by the fires. And even when those affected do have insurance, history shows that \n. The fires will doubtless also spark new regulations, which will make rebuilding more expensive.\nSome people now face the prospect of leaving or remaining homeless in stricken regional economies. All of us are less resilient to future shock \u2013 and future shocks there will be. Natural climate variation might have brought a year as hot as 2019 to Australia \n, but greenhouse gas pollution has increased that frequency to one in eight. And every day the coalfires burn in Australia and elsewhere, we\u2019re shortening those odds \u2013 adding to the severity of the fires of tomorrow.\nRight now, many Australians are simply exhausted. They have been deprived of their summer vacations and beset by debilitating smoke. And as the immediate trauma slowly fades, other impacts will emerge. \nare already reporting health effects from inhalation of bushfire smoke, and over the longer term more and more consequences will be felt. Some medical researchers fear that the consequences of smoke exposure from this year\u2019s fires will be felt for generations.\nAny credible response to such a massive national catastrophe needs to be proportionate to the danger. Instead the government response has been risible. It wants to plant more trees to capture carbon, but also wants more coal burned and more forest cleared, so there will be less to catch fire when the next big fire comes. Its previous climate denialism has been revealed as a catastrophic error, but it remains paralysed in the face of a disaster it helped create.\nIf Australia was being threatened by an external enemy, Scott Morrison\u2019s government would be doing everything within its power to recruit allies. It would put the economy on a war footing, and raise arms. But when it comes to climate-fuelled catastrophes, it claims that there\u2019s nothing it can do: Australians have to remain among the world\u2019s worst greenhouse gas polluters, and keep spoiling international efforts to address the problem. To do otherwise, the government says, would be \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d. But guess what? There is a solution \u2013 burn more fossil fuels, especially gas. To an increasing number of Australians these lies are nauseating. The words of our prime minister sound like the words of a traitor. \nWhat does one do when immense evil is occurring in one\u2019s country? As far as swift climate action is concerned, all good choices have gone up in smoke, and only difficult, divisive options remain. Australians marched against the Vietnam war, and prevailed. But they also protested against the horrific treatment of asylum seekers, and so far have failed. Now we shall see how communities, businesses and politicians respond to this crisis in \u201cthe lucky country\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low", "title": "When it comes to climate hypocrisy, Canada's leaders have reached a new low | Bill McKibben", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:30:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>A territory that has 0.5% of the Earth\u2019s population plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget<br></p><p>Americans elected Donald Trump, who insisted climate change was a hoax \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that since taking office he\u2019s been all-in for the fossil fuel industry.

Yet the country\u2019s leaders seem likely in the next few weeks to approve a vast new tar sands mine which will pour carbon into the atmosphere through the 2060s. They know \u2013 yet they can\u2019t bring themselves to act on the knowledge. Now that \n cause for despair.\nThe Teck mine would be the biggest tar sands mine yet: 113 square miles of petroleum mining, located just 16 miles from the border of Wood Buffalo national park. A federal panel \n the mine despite conceding that it would likely be harmful to the environment and to the land culture of Indigenous people. These giant tar sands mines (easily visible on Google Earth) are already among the biggest scars humans have ever carved on the planet\u2019s surface. But Canadian authorities ruled that the mine was nonetheless in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d.\nHere\u2019s how Justin Trudeau, recently re-elected as Canada\u2019s prime minister, \n in a speech to cheering Texas oilmen a couple of years ago: \u201cNo country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there.\u201d That is to say, Canada, which is 0.5% of the planet\u2019s population, plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget. Ottawa hides all this behind a \n about \u201cnet-zero emissions by 2050\u201d and so on, but they are empty promises. In the here-and-now they can\u2019t rein themselves in. There\u2019s oil in the ground and it must come out.\nThis is painfully hard to watch because it comes as the planet has supposedly reached a turning point. A series of remarkable young people (including Canadians such as Autumn Peltier) have captured the imagination of people around the world; scientists have issued ever sterner warnings; and the images of climate destruction show up in every newspaper. Canadians \n the Australian blazes on television; they should bring back memories of the devastating forest fires that forced the \n, in the heart of the tar sands complex, less than four years ago.\nThe only rational response would be to immediately stop the expansion of new fossil fuel projects. It\u2019s true that we can\u2019t get off oil and gas immediately; for the moment, oil wells continue to pump. But the Teck Frontier proposal is predicated on the idea that we\u2019ll still need vast quantities of oil in 2066, when Greta Thunberg is about to hit retirement age. If an alcoholic assured you he was taking his condition very seriously, but also laying in a 40-year store of bourbon, you\u2019d be entitled to doubt his sincerity, or at least to note his confusion. \n has addled the Canadian ability to do basic math: more does not equal less, and 2066 is not any time soon. An emergency means you act now.\nIn fairness, Canada has company here. For every territory making a sincere effort to kick fossil fuels (California, Scotland) there are other capitals just as paralyzed as Ottawa. Australia\u2019s fires creep ever closer to the seat of government in Canberra, yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, can\u2019t seem to imagine any future for his nation other than mining more coal. Australia and Canada are both rich nations, their people highly educated, but they seem unable to control the zombie momentum of fossil fuels.\nThere\u2019s obviously something hideous about watching the Trumps and the Putins of the world gleefully shred our future. But it\u2019s disturbing in a different way to watch leaders \n to care \u2013 a kind of gaslighting that can reduce you to numb nihilism. Trudeau, for all his charms, doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways: if you can\u2019t bring yourself to stop a brand-new tar sands mine then you\u2019re not a climate leader.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/hiring-new-whitehall-geniuses-pouring-water-leaky-jug": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/hiring-new-whitehall-geniuses-pouring-water-leaky-jug", "title": "Hiring new Whitehall geniuses is like pouring water into a leaky jug |  Nitika Agarwal", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:34:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>To transform the civil service, look to Canada or Portugal for ways to unlock the treasure trove of talent</p><p>The floodgates are open: Dominic Cummings is well on his way, apparently, to recruiting \u201ctrue cognitive diversity\u201d into government.

But a few new people in No 10, however maverick, will make little difference. The whole machine needs to change if Cummings is to achieve the vision of a responsive, citizen-centred, 21st-century government.\nThe good news, contrary to what some reformists suggest, is that there are many smart, creative thinkers and doers already in government. But unless Whitehall works in ways that fully leverage its 430,000-strong workforce, hiring more geniuses is like pouring water into a leaky jug.\nIt\u2019s time government unlocked the talent it already has.\nWhitehall already employs more than 23,000 policy specialists and more than 16,800 technology, data, scientific and economic specialists, according to the \n. They include professionals such as senior data scientists or, say, the role of \n in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2014 people similar to the gems Cummings is looking for.\nThe bad news is that this wealth of expertise isn\u2019t being used. According to Vicky Pryce, former joint head of the UK Government Economics Service, there has already been at least one previous attempt, in the late 2000s, to identify scientific experts in Whitehall departments in the light of challenges such as climate breakdown. There were, indeed, many scientists across the civil service \u2013 but most were working on policy that had absolutely nothing to do with their specialism. \nTo unleash civil servants\u2019 full potential, the government needs to match them to the right jobs. For inspiration, it could look to Canada, which is developing an internationally acclaimed \n. Here, employees can highlight all their transferable skills in digital profiles visible to potential managers. If it followed suit, No 10 could unearth a treasure trove of skills across Whitehall. \nBritain could also study overseas attempts at fundamentally remixing the state to make it more nimble and responsive. The New Zealand government, for example, is \n such as mental health and child poverty. By building cross-departmental project teams, the government promises a stop to endless restructuring and petty turf wars.\nPortugal, meanwhile, is the first country in the world to legislate for a policy \u201csandbox\u201d at the centre of government. More common in financial services than in policy, idea of a sandbox is to test policies swiftly before wider implementation.\nEven when great people are in the right job in government, there\u2019s little point in having one of \n if it doesn\u2019t work effectively with ministers and their special advisers.\nFor instance, Nick Hillman, former special adviser to David Willetts, the minister for universities and science from 2010-13, recalls when senior civil servants responsible for higher education policy said they were too busy to attend meetings he had set up with private providers, despite it being a top ministerial priority.\nThe relationship between the apolitical and political echelons of the civil service have been strained in the past three years. Momentum on Brexit and an ambitious domestic agenda present an opportunity to rebuild mutual respect and get more done as a result. The government can do this by appointing special advisers who are genuine experts in their field, and formally inducting both civil servants and special advisers on how to make best use of their respective remits.\nPerhaps the best thing Cummings can do to unleash the smart brains in the civil service is to encourage calculated risk-taking. This is counter to its predominant culture of avoiding failure at all costs, which can make disruptors feel isolated and unsupported.\nThere are good reasons for the government machine to guard its reputation and taxpayer funds. But it is possible to carve out a fraction of funds for experimentation, with the understanding that while failure is likely, it\u2019s worth it for the possibility of real change. These small, high-risk funding pots can exist alongside the rest of government funding, which is bound by the usual caution and restraint. \nThis is how investment works, by splitting up money between high, medium and low-risk projects. In its innovation grants to private companies, the government already takes this approach, and it is an attitude that can also be used to support experimentation inside government itself. Both \n, factoring government-led innovation funding into their national budgets.\nThis government has the opportunity to take bold action. Creating a more dynamic civil service could be a powerful tool for change. \nNitika Agarwal is chief operating officer at \n, a global learning platform for public servants\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/diary-of-a-coronavirus-evacuee-everyones-trying-to-avoid-contact-with-each-other": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/diary-of-a-coronavirus-evacuee-everyones-trying-to-avoid-contact-with-each-other", "title": "Diary of a coronavirus evacuee: 'Everyone's trying to avoid contact with each other' | Daniel Ou Yang", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 07:42:30 GMT", "summary": "<p>Australian Daniel Ou Yang, 21, was on the Air New Zealand flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland.

After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I\u2019ll look after myself from there on.\nThere were a lot of us evacuating, with two or three other countries including us. Everyone\u2019s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport.\nI found myself a quiet spot, and talked to my family and friends on my phone until we started lining up to get our boarding pass.\nAt 4.30pm they told us after getting our boarding pass to wait for the security clearance to be opened, but to line up first because they\u2019ll be a lot of different countries evacuating at once all through one entrance.\nIt wasn\u2019t until around 9.30pm that they started processing everyone. Our flight was due to leave at 11pm.\nI originally lined up behind everyone, again nervous of the close proximity. As it reached 10pm, I saw a lot of Chinese rushing to the front, and I was encouraged to join them, so I did. They were all going on the same Auckland flight as me, so we were allowed to cut the queue to be processed first.\nI felt a bit guilty, all these foreigners looking at us cutting the line, maybe they will think that we are getting special treatment because we are Chinese.\nThere was this lady with her two young kids also evacuating and they were running late. I waited for them to bring them with me through the security. From there everyone was wearing full hazmat suits.\nIt took us an hour to finally get through to immigration and the last security check point before our flight gate 334. It was already 11.10pm.\nI got through but the lady was stopped because she had ice skating shoes in the carry on which weren\u2019t allowed. I told her to just leave them, but she was unwilling to. In the end, it was 11.20pm and I said I needed to go make the flight and I\u2019ll tell them to wait for her and her kids.\nIt was a huge rush and I thought I missed it because there was no one at the gate. But I made it just in time. I was on the phone to the embassy letting them know about the lady and kids. I hope they made it on.\nThe flight itself wasn\u2019t too bad, but we were delayed so didn\u2019t leave until 1am.\nAfter having a really late dinner (or early breakfast) I fell asleep very quickly. Luckily there was a spare seat next to me so I sat next to the window and a girl sat on the other end, leaving plenty of space for each other.\nWe were supplied with masks and hand sanitisers along with the normal flight care package. I woke up at 10 and went to the bathroom. We were encouraged to leave our seat as little as possible so I was hesitant.\nUsed a lot of hand sanitisers throughout the flight along with everyone else. Everyone is just trying to avoid contact with each other as much as possible and constantly using hand sanitisers.\nWe\u2019ve arrived at New Zealand now. I have to prepare myself for another long flight back to Christmas Island, \n. I\u2019m nervous about being there.\nI heard from others there\u2019s barely any wifi and no reception. There is nothing to do. Hopefully the facility is clean, and I can be out of there smoothly.

How \u2013 when dealing with a health crisis or a humanitarian disaster \u2013 you are limited in the choice and nature of your partners in the place where it is occurring, and the limitations they impose.\nBut if the politics of such accommodations is always uncomfortable, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak encapsulates in a stark fashion a number of difficult issues.\nAbove all, it asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states.\nLooming above all else is the fact that China is a country whose trajectory under Xi Jinping has been to become more, not less, authoritarian, marked by \n for Uighurs, a growing internet crackdown and its \nto street protests in Hong Kong.\nThere seems little doubt either that China\u2019s bureaucratic culture of control and secrecy, including the local government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the information emerging about the disease in the first weeks of the epidemic, contributed to its initial spread in December and the first weeks of January.\nIt is also true that after admitting the scale of the problem, China has shared much information internationally, in line with its commitments, about the nature and spread of the virus, and deployed unprecedented and costly national efforts in a bid to contain the outbreak, even as it has employed what many would see as draconian restrictions.\nInterposed into the midst of all this has been the WHO \u2013 and Tedros \u2013 a relationship complicated by the fact that China is a major donor to the world health body. The mix of health and international politics has been underlined by the \n even after the coronavirus spread there.\nThe argument about how the WHO has negotiated the complexities boils down to several key questions.\nThe first is whether the organisation should have pushed harder for Beijing to be more forthcoming when evidence of a new form of coronavirus first emerged, but before the scale of the outbreak was fully acknowledged. And whether the head of the UN body should have been so warm in praising the response of a country that unsettles so many for its secrecy and rights violations.\nIn particular, the fraught politics of the WHO \n a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) has once again come under the spotlight in the same way it did during the \n in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nSome of those most critical have parsed Xi\u2019s meeting with Tedros \u2013 and Xi\u2019s declared hope that the UN body would assess the \u201cepidemic situation in an objective, just, calm and reasonable way\u201d \u2013 as pressure from Beijing to ensure WHO would refrain from designating the epidemic a global health emergency to protect China\u2019s economy.\nAlthough that didn\u2019t happen, the WHO\u2019s advice \u2013 contrary to that of many governments \u2013 is that it still \u201cadvises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u201d.\nAnd on this front some are pointing to a startling contradiction: how the UN body has praised the extreme internal travel restrictions in China while criticising other countries for implementing their own travel measures.\nSources familiar with the politics at the top of the organisation, and the decision over declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, insist that WHO have had to balance very difficult issues.\nWith China\u2019s well-known history of extreme sensitivity to criticism, the argument goes, a conscious decision was made to prioritise diplomacy that would encourage China to be as open as possible in sharing information with international researchers and health bodies even at the risk of drawing inevitable criticism.\n\u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December,\u201d said one close observer. \u201cThe organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there were two options: to keep pressing behind the scenes, or to go public and say at a press conference we didn\u2019t get such and such at this time and for the Chinese to lose face and slam the door. So it seems like a deliberate decision to keep the flow of data coming, to encourage the Chinese to keep focused on the epicentre, even at the risk of being seen in public as kissing up to Beijing.\u201d\nAnd while insiders point to China\u2019s preparedness to come clean and admit mistakes once its central government had realised the scale of the threat, critics counter that greater pressure from WHO might have made that moment come days earlier, potentially helping contain the epidemic at an earlier stage.\nIn the end, whether the current diplomacy was the right approach in balancing the demands of human rights and global risk and the threat to China\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) economy and prestige, only the course of the outbreak will confirm.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/27/did-you-solve-it-toot-toot-for-world-palindrome-day": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/27/did-you-solve-it-toot-toot-for-world-palindrome-day", "title": "Did you solve it?

In other words, POCO is a four digit number, and MUCHO is a five digit number. \nCan you work out which letter stands for which digit so that the sum makes sense?\n POCO is 4595 and MUCHO is 68925\nFor fifteen letter Os to add up to a number ending in the letter O, then O is either 0 (zero) or 5. Let\u2019s say that O is 0 (zero). In this case, fifteen Cs must be CH. The only digits that fit are C = 1 and H = 5. The number MU, therefore, is 15 x P, which means that U must be an 0 (zero) or a 5. But both of those numbers are already taken by the letter O and H. So we can eliminate the case that O is 0, and deduce that O = 5.\nIf O = 5, the carry into the tens column is 7, since 5 x 15 = 75.\nWe can eliminate some of the candidates for C. To start, C cannot be 1, since then 15 x C + 7 = 22, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundred\u2019s column, which would mean that the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 1.\nWe can also eliminate values from 2 to 8 for C, shown here for completeness:\nIf C = 2, then 15 x C + 7 = 37, which means there is a carry of 3 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 8. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 2.\nIf C = 3, then 15 x C + 7 = 52, which means there is a carry of 5 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 0. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 3.\nIf C = 4, then 15 x C + 7 = 67, which means there is a carry of 6 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 1. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 4.\nIf C = 5, then 15 x C + 7 = 82, which means there is a carry of 8 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 3. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 5.\nIf C = 6, then 15 x C + 7 = 97, which means there is a carry of 9 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 4. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 6.\nIf C = 7, then 15 x C + 7 = 112, which means there is a carry of 1 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 6. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 7.\nIf C = 8, then 15 x C + 7 = 127, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 8.\nSo C must be 9. If C = 9, then 15 x C + 7 = 142, which means there is a carry of 4 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which means the C in MUCHO is also a 9.\nIf C = 9, H = 2, and the thousands column has a carry of 7 + 1 = 8. In other words 15P + 8 = MU. P must be between 1 and 6, since MU is less than 100. We have as candidates 1, 3, 4, 6. We can eliminate 1, since this makes MU 23, and 2 is taken. We can eliminate 3, since this makes MU 53 and 5 is taken. We can eliminate 6 because this makes MU 98 and 9 is taken. So P = 4, M= 6 and U = 8.\nGracias!\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/13/can-you-solve-it-the-poco-poco-puzzle": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/13/can-you-solve-it-the-poco-poco-puzzle", "title": "Can you solve it?

They soon began calling themselves \u201cpost-libertarians,\u201d although they weren\u2019t yet sure what would come next. By 2014, they\u2019d started to self-identify as \u201calt-right\u201d. They developed a countercultural tone \u2013 arch, antic, floridly offensive \u2013 that appealed to a growing cohort of disaffected young men, searching for meaning and addicted to the internet. These young men often referred to The Right Stuff, approvingly, as a key part of a \u201clibertarian-to-far-right pipeline\u201d, a path by which \u201cnormies\u201d could advance, through a series of epiphanies, toward \u201cfull radicalisation\u201d.

On Reddit and 4chan and 8chan, where the content moderation was so lax as to be almost non-existent, the memes were more overtly vile.

A spokesperson said the complaint referred to \u201can old and outdated draft version\u201d of \u201can exploratory project\u201d that had been \u201cmisplaced on the intranet of the EP\u201d.\n\u201cOne exploratory project of the EP administration is to study and understand the potentials and threats of AI applied to parliamentary and administrative activities of the institution,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis old draft mentioned facial recognition as a possible field of study, nothing more.\n\u201cData protection is and remains a clear priority of the European parliament and its administration.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/06/how-can-i-copy-1400-dvds-to-a-new-hard-drive": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/06/how-can-i-copy-1400-dvds-to-a-new-hard-drive", "title": "How can I copy 1,400 DVDs to a new hard drive?", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:33 GMT", "summary": "<p>Harry has data backed up to DVDs, but wants to copy the files to a hard drive.

Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.\nThe CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PC/XT\u2019s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn\u2019t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for \u00a362.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.\nIn theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today\u2019s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.\n says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn\u2019t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it\u2019s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there\u2019s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.\nOver the years, many commercial systems have sported multiple DVD drives, sometimes with \n or \n to feed in the discs. But most were aimed at large corporations or service providers, and \n at home users.\nMulti-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to \n. Products aimed at the second were \n, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create \u201ccold storage\u201d backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute \n.\nMF Digital\u2019s \n CD/DVD/BD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed \u2013 perhaps still need \u2013 to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.\nI\u2019m not sure if MF Digital\u2019s cheaper \n would do the job because you don\u2019t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect \u00a31,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.\nThat leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn\u2019t manage to find one \u2013 the search terms are tricky \u2013 and the price might still be prohibitive. I\u2019d guess it would cost from 25p to \u00a31 per disk, and 50p doesn\u2019t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost \u00a3500. You\u2019d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.\nIf anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.\nIf there\u2019s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it\u2019s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don\u2019t set a target, you might never finish the job.\nPerhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.\nAlternatively, you could buy one or two \n and plug them into USB ports, or into a powered USB hub. (Not every USB port provides enough power to run a DVD that doesn\u2019t have its own power supply.) With two drives, you can load a DVD in one drive while the other drive is copying files.\nAfter that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.\n has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for \u201cCopy a lot of CD/DVDs automatically\u201d and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It\u2019s a small (219K), free program and doesn\u2019t need to be installed, so it\u2019s worth a try.\nI also tried Averk\u2019s free \n, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you \u2013 he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive \u2013 and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation\u2019s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.\nThe first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don\u2019t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.\nOver the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it\u2019s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I\u2019m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.\nI\u2019m converting some videos that were in less popular formats \u2013 such as wmv, mov, flv and rm \u2013 to mp4 with the H.264 codec, which is supported by processors (Intel \n) and most graphics cards. Programs such as \n make this very easy to do. You can also reprocess old videos to remove colour casts, make them look sharper, correct faulty aspect ratios and \u201cupscale\u201d their resolution, though the results from my old VHS-C video camera will never look good by today\u2019s standards.\nEven DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids\u2019 birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on \n, Amazon Prime, \n, YouTube or some other streaming service.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules", "title": "Welfare surveillance system violates human rights, Dutch court rules", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 13:18:58 GMT", "summary": "<p>Government told to halt use of AI to detect fraud in decision hailed by privacy campaigners</p><p>A Dutch court has ordered the immediate halt of an automated surveillance system for detecting welfare fraud because it violates human rights, in a judgment likely to resonate well beyond the Netherlands.</p><p>The case was seen as an important legal challenge to the controversial but growing use by governments around the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and risk modelling in administering welfare benefits and other core services.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "A Dutch court has ordered the immediate halt of an automated surveillance system for detecting welfare fraud because it violates human rights, in a judgment likely to resonate well beyond the \n.\nThe case was seen as an important legal challenge to the controversial but growing use by governments around the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and risk modelling in administering welfare benefits and other core services.\n such \u201cdigital welfare states\u201d \u2013 developed often without consultation, and operated secretively and without adequate oversight \u2013 amount to spying on the poor, breaching privacy and human rights norms and unfairly penalising the most vulnerable.\nIn the UK, where the government is accelerating the development of robots in the benefits system, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, Stephen Timms, said: \u201cThis ruling by the Dutch courts demonstrates that parliaments ought to look very closely at the ways in which governments use technology in the social security system, to protect the rights of their citizens.\u201d \nThe UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, applauded the verdict and said it was \u201ca clear victory for all those who are justifiably concerned about the serious threats digital welfare systems pose for human rights\u201d.\nThe decision \u201csets a strong legal precedent for other courts to follow\u201d, he added. \u201cThis is one of the first times a court anywhere has stopped the use of digital technologies and abundant digital information by welfare authorities on human rights grounds.\u201d\nThe verdict will be watched closely by welfare rights campaigners in the UK, where the Department for Work and Pensions is engaged in a digitisation drive that vulnerable claimants fear could plunge them \n.\nA \n found the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had \n on a specialist \u201cintelligent automation garage\u201d where computer scientists were developing more than 100 welfare robots, deep learning and intelligent automation for use in the welfare system.\nThe Dutch government\u2019s risk indication system (SyRI) is a risk calculation model developed over the past decade by the social affairs and employment ministry to predict the likelihood of an individual committing benefit or tax fraud or violating labour laws.\nDeployed primarily in low-income neighbourhoods, it gathers government data previously held in separate silos, such as employment, personal debt and benefit records, and education and housing histories, then analyses it using a secret algorithm to identify which individuals might be at higher risk of committing benefit fraud.\nA broad coalition of privacy and welfare rights groups, backed by the largest Dutch trade union, argued that poor neighbourhoods and their inhabitants were being spied on digitally without any concrete suspicion of individual wrongdoing. SyRI was disproportionately targeting poorer citizens, they said, violating human rights norms.\nThe court ruled that the SyRI legislation contained insufficient safeguards against privacy intrusions and criticised a \u201cserious lack of transparency\u201d about how it worked. It concluded in its ruling that, in the absence of more information, the system may, in targeting poor neighbourhoods, amount to discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic or migrant status.\nThe system did not pass the test required by the \n of a \u201cfair balance\u201d between its objectives, namely to prevent and combat fraud in the interest of economic wellbeing, and the violation of privacy that its use entailed, the court added, declaring the legislation was therefore unlawful. The Dutch government can appeal against the decision.\nChristiaan van Veen, director of the digital welfare state and human rights project at New York University School of Law, said it was \u201cimportant to underline that SyRI is not a unique system; many other governments are experimenting with automated decision-making in the welfare state\u201d.\nVan Veen cited Australia and the UK as countries where such concerns were particularly acute. \u201cThis strong ruling will set a strong precedent globally that will encourage activists in other countries to challenge their governments,\u201d he said.\nAlston predicted the judgment would be \u201ca wake-up call for politicians and others, not just in the Netherlands\u201d. The special rapporteur presented a \n to the UN general assembly in October on the emergence of the \u201cdigital welfare state\u201d in countries around the globe, warning of the need \u201cto alter course significantly and rapidly to avoid stumbling, zombie-like, into a digital welfare dystopia\u201d.\nIn the UK, as well as contracts with the outsourcing multinationals IBM, Tata Consultancy and Capgemini, the DWP is also working with UiPath, a New York-based company co-founded by Daniel Dines, the world\u2019s first \u201cbot billionaire\u201d, who \n: \u201cI want a robot for every person.\u201d\nHis software is being deployed in an effort to introduce machine learning to check benefit claims, which suggests welfare computers will autonomously learn and alter the way they make decisions with minimum human intervention.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker", "title": "Google Nest Mini review: better bass and recycled plastic", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 07:00:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>Upgrade keeps what is good and improves sound for Google\u2019s smallest, cheapest smart speaker</p><p>The second generation of Google\u2019s smallest smart speaker gets a new name, more eco-friendly, a little smarter and more bass.</p><p>The \u00a349 Nest Mini replaces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/26/google-home-mini-review-voice-assistant-speaker\">Google Home Mini</a> as part of a revamped and renamed line of Google smart home products under the Nest brand, pushing its predecessor to a clearance price of only \u00a319.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/14/sonos-move-review-brilliant-sound-now-portable": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/14/sonos-move-review-brilliant-sound-now-portable", "title": "Sonos Move review: brilliant sound now portable", "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 07:00:28 GMT", "summary": "<p>Wireless smart speaker with 10-hour battery, room-filling sound, wifi and Bluetooth is not your ordinary portable speaker</p><p>Sonos has finally made a portable wifi and Bluetooth speaker that sounds great \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite what most will have imagined.</p><p>For years Sonos has made some of the very best wifi speakers, recently adding optional voice assistants from Google and Amazon.

These can be over \u00a310 per MB, the amount required to browse one web page. They can kick in if a passenger simply takes a single photo.\nExtortionate charges can also stack up if a boat or plane passes close to national borders. \n are configured to pick up the strongest signal and if that happens to come from a country outside the EU, international roaming charges will kick in.\nHaines\u2019s phone signal was automatically relayed from aircraft antenna via satellite to a ground network operated by AeroMobile. The Crawley-based company, a subsidiary of Panasonic Avionics, began offering inflight services in 2008 and 23 airlines have signed up. Airborne users are not automatically sent text messages by their provider detailing charges. Moreover, cabin crew on the Virgin Atlantic flight made no mention of potential charges if passengers fail to heed advice to switch to flight mode. The airline, which offers the service on half of its fleet, acknowledged that while onboard announcements warn of international roaming charges when using AeroMobile, they do not say that those who don\u2019t use it can also be liable. It declined to state the cut it received from the charges.\nHaines\u2019s bill was levied by her company\u2019s service provider, Intercity Technology, which sells phones and services to businesses and uses the \n network.\nIntercity confirmed its inflight service connects automatically, even if the phone is stowed in the overhead locker. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s included in customers\u2019 monthly bill as an over- charge for roaming in a country not covered by their selected tariff.\u201d It insists it alerts customers to unusual charges and, if necessary, suspends data to protect their interests.\nHaines claims she never received an alert. \u201cThe first I knew about it was when my data was cut off when I arrived at Barbados,\u201d she says. \u201cI assumed there had been fraudulent activity. It was only later that Intercity informed me of the reason.\u201d\nIntercity has offered to contribute \u00a3500 towards her bill as a goodwill gesture. It also promised to remind all customers to switch to flight mode.\nAeroMobile says it advises airline clients to announce that roaming charges apply on board. \u201cThe passenger will receive a text from the onboard system telling them they are connected to the mobile service. However, it is their home operator that must communicate the cost.\u201d\nIntercity didn\u2019t respond to requests for its satellite roaming charges. Vodafone, its network provider, charges up to \u00a37.20 per MB of data for airline connections, compared with \u00a36 by Three. BT\u2019s charge is \u00a39.20. All include this in their data roaming and spend cap, so customers have their data cut off after the bill reaches \u00a335, unless they have asked for it to be lifted. EE requires customers to buy an add-on at \u00a336 a day for 5MB. Virgin Mobile says its customers can\u2019t connect to satellite services.\nThe charges can confuse customer service staff as well as customers. When Ali Hines was billed for downloading \u00a343 of data from a Norwegian network while flying home from Indonesia, she was told by O2 that her phone must have picked up a superior signal over the border. Hines pointed out she was 10,000km from Norway at the time of the download and was then told, like Haines, she had inadvertently connected to AeroMobile.\nShe insists her phone was switched off, whereupon O2 reckoned it must have connected while boarding or leaving the aircraft, although the download was three hours after takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019ve since refunded the charge, but there\u2019s nothing to stop this from happening again,\u201d she says.\nO2 confirmed the phone had connected to AeroMobile, which uses a Norwegian mast, and that she should have received a text alert. Its satellite roaming charges are \u00a37.50 per MB.\n\u201cWe are sorry Ms Hines was given incorrect information and have credited \u00a351 to her account,\u201d it says.\nGay Haines, who is still left owing \u00a3600, plans to escalate her complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. \u201cI cannot believe I am the only idiot who forgot to turn their phone to flight,\u201d she said.\n The EU has banned mobile phone providers charging extra fees for users to use their allowance of minutes, texts or (most) data within EU territory. Take care if you are near a border as phones connect to the strongest signal, which could be in a non-EU country.\n Think twice before turning your data-roaming cap off. Providers have to cut you off when you\u2019ve used \u20ac50 under EU rules, unless you ask them to lift the cap. If you do, you risk unlimited bills.\n In the air or at sea, your mobile could connect to a network in a non-EU country or an onboard satellite system on your ship or a nearby ship, in which case EU rules won\u2019t apply. Switch your device into flight mode to avoid this.\n Complain to a dispute resolution scheme. If you feel you were unfairly charged and can\u2019t resolve the issue with your provider, you can take your complaint to the Communications Ombudsman or adjudicator Cisas.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/09/how-do-i-find-a-smartphone-with-the-specifications-i-really-want": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/09/how-do-i-find-a-smartphone-with-the-specifications-i-really-want", "title": "How do I find a smartphone with the specifications I really want?", "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Product search tools help you find a phone, PC or camera if you know the specs you want</p><p>My Samsung S8 has given up the ghost, and the prohibitive cost of repair means I\u2019m in the market for a new mobile phone.

In fact, it\u2019s a problem I share: nobody offers a laptop that meets my most-desired specification, though a few come close.\nThe second problem is that it can be hard work. There are thousands of products with variable specifications, many of them incomplete. The numbers you can find may well be a mixture of inches and centimetres, kilograms and pounds, and binary and decimal bytes. In some cases, I\u2019ve created spreadsheets to compare products, partly to automate the format conversions.\nThe third problem is that choosing purely on specification ignores other important features, such as manufacturing quality, ergonomics, software experience, reliability and support. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to get a \u201chands on\u201d and to read independent reviews, plus the manufacturer\u2019s support forums, if any.\nThere\u2019s always a risk factor, and some technology buyers are more risk-averse than others. Some are happy buying smartphones from little-known suppliers on Chinese websites; others will prefer to buy from a local shop, so they can take it back when they run into a problem.\nThe fourth problem is that most of us have personal preferences.

Maybe they just like the colour or the way it looks. Buyers are often willing to compromise on specifications when less tangible aspects of desirability trigger an emotional response.\nI\u2019m not saying that buying using specifications is wrong: people who ignore them risk buying stupid things. However, specs are not the whole story, and for many buyers, they are not even the main story. Either way, knowing what you value will help you make a more informed choice.\nFrom your wishlist of specifications, you want to buy a dual-sim Android 10 smartphone with at least 8GB of memory, 128GB or more storage (expandable), and a 90Hz or better display. This sort of spec should give you a decent range of options. Unfortunately, you also want a headphone jack, wireless charging and water resistance, which reduces the options to none. The last thing on your wishlist is 5G: \u201cnice to have for future proofing; not required\u201d. That\u2019s a nice thought, but \u201cAndroid\u201d and \u201cfuture proofing\u201d are mutually incompatible.\nI don\u2019t know of any phones that exactly match your wishlist, and I think the long-term trend is the other way. I envisage future smartphones as completely sealed devices with no ports at all. Sims will be \u201cvirtual\u201d \n (stored on the device, instead of physically inserted) and everything else will be done wirelessly.\nHeadphones are on the way out, and microSD card slots \u2013 used to add storage \u2013 will probably go the same way. For now, your spec is mostly practical if you can fit a microSD card into a \n, instead of a second sim.\nIt only took a couple of minutes on \n to come up with what might be your best choice \u2013 the \n \u2013 but you could also consider the \n running Android 9. If you want a 5G phone, the only option is the \n. You can \n. They are all reasonably priced.\nThese mid-range smartphones have the features you want except for wireless charging and the real stumbling block, water resistance. However, you can get both of those from your current supplier in the form of the \n. If you can find dual-sim models with Android 10, the only thing you\u2019d be giving up is the high screen refresh rate, and the rumour is that \n in February.\nOn the whole, then, I think you should stick with Samsung, unless you have totally gone off the company, which would be understandable in the circumstances.\nGSM Arena is really useful if you\u2019re buying a smartphone or a tablet \u2013 the two product categories it covers. If I\u2019m buying something else, I\u2019m often tempted to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the GSM Arena of\u201d cameras or laptops or TV sets or whatever. There is rarely a good answer, but for digital camera buyers, the Amazon-owned DP Review website is excellent.\nLike GSM Arena, DP Review lets you \n and \n. I\u2019ve used these features in earlier answers about digital photography.\nLaptop buyers could really do with their own GSM Arena, but I\u2019ve never found one. However, the \n on the somewhat obscure \n is worth a go. It has sliders to set maximum and minimum values for things like launch date, number of processor cores, power consumption, memory, storage, display size and vertical resolution, battery capacity, estimated battery life, and so on. You can ignore any fields you don\u2019t care about. You can sort the results by value, price, performance or by name, and its rankings seem sensible. Alternatively, you can focus on a particular class of laptop \u2013 the options are Mainstream, Ultraportable, Business, Gaming and CAD/3D modelling \u2013 or on a single brand. Clicking on a laptop brings up its full specification.\nThis \u201claptop search engine\u201d also has a \n and \n. It looks like a labour of love. It solicits donations and has a \n page. One incentive is that donors can get personal laptop buying advice. I hope it survives. Maybe Jeff Bezos should buy it, because Amazon\u2019s laptop search badly needs upgrading.\nThere are, of course, plenty of useful websites such as \n, \n and \n. They all have good reviews and top product picks. However, when it comes to finding laptops that fit a choice of specs, I usually end up using the limited and often clunky filtering features on retail sites such as Currys PC World, eBuyer, Argos, Laptops Direct and so on. The obvious drawback is that they won\u2019t find interesting products that they don\u2019t stock. And those are the ones that someone hunting for a very particular spec may well want to buy.\nGSM Arena is a global website, so some phones may not work in the UK, or wherever you happen to live. There\u2019s less of a risk now the UK has six different 4G bands between 800MHz (the old analogue TV band) and 2.6GHz, but if you\u2019re buying a smartphone from overseas, it\u2019s important to check. Phones sold within the UK should, of course, work with British networks.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked", "title": "Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked", "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 07:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones \u2013 at the best prices right now</p><p>Need a new smartphone but don\u2019t know which one is the very best?

Then I started to get \u201cscreen time\u201d notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.\nWhen I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour; checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I\u2019d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.\nI was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I\u2019d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.\nWhen the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening \u2013 seduced by the allure of shiny new technology \u2013 I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.\nConscious that the Echo wasn\u2019t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine \u2013 a set of Alexa\u2019s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to \u201cstart my day\u201d. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the Guardian\u2019s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.\nIt was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it\u2019s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.\nDiving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the Guardian skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears\u2019s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute\u2019s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.\nMy phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.\nNot only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn\u2019t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn\u2019t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.\nMost notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn\u2019t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.\nIt\u2019s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it\u2019s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you\u2019re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I\u2019ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.\nSurprisingly, given my initial trepidation towards her, I\u2019ve actually grown fond of Alexa. And yes, she has helped me use my phone less; my average screen time is down by 23%. I\u2019m still addicted to Twitter, however, although I\u2019ve found a compromise \u2013 Alexa now tweets for me. The problem is my flatmate now thinks that I talk to myself.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/22/so-i-got-an-amazon-echo-but-can-alexa-get-my-life-together": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/22/so-i-got-an-amazon-echo-but-can-alexa-get-my-life-together", "title": "So I got an Amazon Echo.

Hence, my new co-worker: Amazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 \u2013 an Alexa-enabled device with a screen. I\u2019m having people over for brunch, and this time, I\u2019d like them to not make disparaging comments about the bulging veins in my temples. So I\u2019ll be using Alexa to help me pick the menu, do the shopping, act as a sous chef, pick music, offer dinner party games and help clean up afterwards. Or so I hope.\n\u201cAlexa, can you clean the house for me?\u201d\n\u201cI would if I could, but I can\u2019t \u2013 so I won\u2019t\u201d\nOh well, can\u2019t fault the attitude.\nFirst, I attempt to find a recipe. This is usually a nightmare for me, given that I only cook dishes whose instructions pass my Three Fs test: no food waste, no faff, and no frivolous ingredients; while dried Iranian limes may be a standard-use ingredient for some, I know that any I buy will be used once and then spend a decade decaying at the back of my cupboard.\nIt turns out that all it takes to do away with a painstaking multi-hour process of ploughing through webpage after webpage, is to say: \u201cAlexa, show me brunch recipes.\u201d A BBC Good Food menu pops up and one catches my attention: \u201cTurkish one-pan eggs and peppers.\u201d When I ask Alexa to open it, she tells me that it \u201ctakes 35 minutes to make and has five stars with 79 ratings\u201d. A quick read-through confirms that the trickiest culinary feat required is cracking eggs, and that the most exotic ingredient required is parsley. I\u2019m sold.\nThe next step of my prep is usually even more agonising: shopping. If you wanted to brace yourself for food shortages in a post-Brexit Britain, you could do a lot worse than visit my local supermarket, in which staff automatically respond to casual greetings with: \u201cWe\u2019re out of stock.\u201d This time, however, I say: \u201cAlexa, show me shopping skills\u201d and Morrisons pops up second. I \u201cenable skill\u201d (skills are a bit like apps for Alexa), then all I do is tell Alexa which ingredients to add to my Morrisons shopping basket, log on to the supermarket\u2019s website and select my timeslot. The ingredients arrive shortly afterwards, with nary a surly queue in sight.\nShortly before guests arrive, I decide to set the mood. It\u2019s Sunday, and I\u2019m determined to usher in a new, relaxed and happy era for my reputation as a host. A soundtrack of carefree reggae seems to be the thing. I ask Alexa to \u201cplay reggae\u201d. Bob Marley\u2019s Three Little Birds fires up, accompanied by the lyrics scrolling down screen in gigantic font so that I find myself staring at the words: \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout a thing, \u2018cause every little thing gonna be all right.\u201d It feels a little on the nose, given my aforementioned hosting anxiety.\n\u201cAlexa, you know I\u2019m worried \u2013 don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\nA likely story.\nAs guests turn up, I prepare a welcome cocktail of a Tom Collins, using an Alexa skill called The Bar. After a few bits of banter-tastic menu navigation (\u201cWelcome to the bar, can I see some ID?\u201d; \u201cTom Collins coming right up!\u201d) I\u2019m given instructions and an ingredient list that let me whip up a long, refreshing citrusy drink.\nI tell Alexa to start reading me the recipe and I follow it step by step, using the Echo Show to set voice-activated timers as I go. By the end of it, I\u2019ve got a shakshuka-like dish of saut\u00e9ed, spicy pepper and tomato sauce encircling baked eggs \u2013 accompanied by a creamy yoghurt topping, punchily packed with parsley and garlic. Unfortunately, there was no setting to stop me mistiming how long to cook an egg for without setting the yolk into a solid yellow disc. But that aside, I\u2019m well chuffed with the results \u2013 and by judiciously spooning the yoghurt on to the top of the egg yolks, the happy murmurs of my guests suggest I\u2019ve gotten away with my overcooking.\nFood over, so it\u2019s time for games. Asking: \u201cAlexa, show me game skills\u201d shows us a menu of 30 options and leads to playing a guess-who game called Akinator, which attempts to tell you which famous character you are thinking about, just by asking a few questions \u2013 we utterly outfox Alexa by selecting Tottenham MP David Lammy. We follow up with Song Quiz \u2013 which plays us clips of tracks from a set genre (we select 90s) and makes us guess artist and song title. Cue impassioned debates about decades-old R&B, cries of \u201cYes!\u201d at the hearing of nostalgic faves and an entirely unfair victimisation of the winner for being a Michael Bolton fan, due to jealousy of his excellent musical knowledge and excellent mixing of Tom Collins cocktails.\nThe gathering ends, guests are happy, and my pulse is unlikely to trouble the emergency services. All in all: a very easy afternoon of entertaining. As my last guest leaves, they quip: \u201cWhat now? You going to get Alexa to start the dishwasher?\u201d\nSigh, if only I had a dishwasher.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/from-sous-chef-to-security-guard-how-the-nation-uses-its-smart-speakers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/from-sous-chef-to-security-guard-how-the-nation-uses-its-smart-speakers", "title": "From sous chef to security guard: how the nation uses its smart speakers", "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2020 11:17:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device.

Even cheap laptops can run \n Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today\u2019s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.\nAny PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.\nEither way, it\u2019s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.\nI don\u2019t want to repeat \n in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the \n is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.\nFor example, you can start with 4GB of memory, a traditional hard drive, a cast-off screen and a cheap printer, and improve the system when you can afford new parts. Most desktops can now handle up to 32GB or more memory \u2013 \n \u2013 and you can replace a slow hard drive with a fast, chip-based \n. You can easily replace the original monitor with a bigger, brighter screen, which you can\u2019t do with a laptop.\nShort of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it\u2019s done.\nMonitors have improved a lot in the past decade. You can now buy them for \n or \n, so that\u2019s what I usually recommend. The corollary is that most older screens are not worth very much second hand, no matter how much they cost when new.\nSecond hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.\nYou may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.\nThanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, \n usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.\nBut the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for \n and 2GB for browser tabs.\nIndeed, given that memory modules are now cheap \u2013 \n \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to use less.\nSSDs have also plunged in price. Today, 120GB drives go for \n, and 240GB drives can be had for \n. It makes no sense to buy a PC with a 32GB drive, and for Windows 10 users even 64GB is no longer enough.\nWhen a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the \n app (remember to click \u201cClean up system files\u201d) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.\nToday, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or \n is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and \u201cpower users\u201d will want, and often need, more.\nPicking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)\nNo one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it\u2019s using without looking it up. Often, differences don\u2019t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.\nBusinesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It\u2019s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it\u2019s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don\u2019t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn\u2019t care. If you\u2019re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won\u2019t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.\nThere\u2019s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of \u201cnormal\u201d.\nSo, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.\nThe good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today\u2019s standards. In response to the market\u2019s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more \n, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a \n of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.\nThere are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip\u2019s score on the \n and compare it with your own PC\u2019s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don\u2019t matter.)\nFor a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.\nLet\u2019s put those PassMark numbers in context. Even a 6W Pentium Silver N5000, designed for thin laptops, manages \n, which is my minimum. My old Core i5-2500 scores \n, while the i5-3470 used in last week\u2019s refurbished \n (\u00a3135) scores \n. The i5-8400 in my current desktop scores \n. A really fast (and pricey) Core i9-9900K scores \n.\nIn general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you\u2019re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons", "title": "Which is the best PC for someone who has Parkinson\u2019s?", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>Richard wants a laptop for its flatter keys, but desktop PCs can have any keyboard type </p><p>I plan to get a new computer for home use, no games.

With a laptop, you are more or less stuck with the keyboard fitted by the manufacturer, and the quality varies from average to mediocre. With a desktop PC, you can take your pick from dozens of USB and Bluetooth keyboards. These range from keyboards with flat, island-style isolated keys to full mechanical keyboards aimed at professionals and gamers.\nSome USB keyboards have \n for children and for grown-ups with vision and other problems. There\u2019s also a programmable membrane keyboard, \n, that doesn\u2019t have keys at all. Helpikeys works with a variety of keyboard overlays, and people can create custom keyboards with its Layout Builder software.\nThere are lots of flat keyboards that might suit you. The wireless Bluetooth options include the \n (\u00a385.76 on Amazon.co.uk) and \n (\u00a371.99) keyboards, plus similar models from \n (\u00a336.99) and \n (\u00a329.99). Personally, I\u2019d go for the silver \n wired USB keyboard (\u00a328.66), though there are cheaper wired options.\nEither way, consider contacting \n, a charity that provides specialist advice on technology to \u201cpeople of any age, living with any disability or impairment\u201d. AbilityNet may also be able to offer you \n through its network of volunteers. It\u2019s a wonderful resource for older people and those with disabilities.\nThere are some good reasons for buying a laptop. The main ones are, first, that you need to use your PC while out and about, or at least in different rooms; and second, that you don\u2019t have room for a desktop monitor and external keyboard.\nSize is no longer a disqualification because you can get tiny \n that will attach to the back of a monitor. However, it\u2019s pretty hard to use a desktop without some sort of desk or table and a chair, and those take up valuable floor space.\nIf you have room for a desktop, there are lots of reasons to buy one. Desktops generally run faster than laptops because they can use faster processors that run hotter. Desktops do not limit your screen size or keyboard quality, so you can optimise the system to your needs. Desktops are easier to expand, update and repair \u2013 you can usually add extra memory, bigger drives and faster graphics cards \u2013 so they should last longer. And if your system is set up correctly, \n, so they are better for your health.\nMost laptops let you plug in an external monitor or screen display, a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, a mouse, headphones, ethernet adapter, and external USB hard drives for backups and extra storage. \n Windows supports multiple displays as standard, so the main problem is picking a cable to connect the second screen to your laptop.\nFor most purposes, we\u2019ve already left behind VGA and DVI connections. Modern TV sets and monitors have HDMI ports, and sometimes others such as DisplayPort. Modern laptops typically have HDMI, DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort connections, and sometimes USB Type C ports.\nIf both devices have HDMI ports, an HDMI cable will do the job. Sometimes you might need an adapter cable such as HDMI-to-DisplayPort, or vice versa. Otherwise, there are cables with VGA, DVI, Mini DisplayPort, DisplayPort or USB-C plugs at one end and HDMI at the other end.\nThere are three problems with this approach. First, your laptop may not have enough ports to plug everything in. Second, it\u2019s tedious to have to unplug all the accessories when you want to take your laptop somewhere, then plug them back in later. Third, you have all the disadvantages of a desktop PC without the advantages.\nIn the early days of business laptops, docking stations alleviated these problems. Accessories \u2013 keyboard, screen, mouse etc \u2013 plugged into the docking station and the laptop docked with that. Dedicated docking stations are still available, but the general-purpose solution is a mini-tower like the \n. Everything plugs into the Plugable, or similar device, so there is only one USB 2 or preferably USB 3 cable to the laptop. There are also USB-C versions that can provide power to the laptop as well as all the various connections.\nYou could take this route if you need a laptop, but it will cost more and not perform as well.\nThe desktop PC is far from being an endangered species, but it has speciated a long way from the \u201cone size fits all\u201d models popular a few decades ago. There are tiny \n 10 PCs for serving media, SFF (small form factor) models for office use, all-in-ones built straight into a screen, high-powered towers for music and video editing, and even more high-powered machines with sci-fi styling and multicoloured lights for gamers. For your purposes, almost any of them would do.\nIf you are on a budget, an acceptable minimum would be something like a Lenovo IdeaCentre 310s with an Intel Pentium J5005 processor, 4GB of memory, DVD and a 1TB hard drive. Currys PC World is selling this PC for \n, and Lenovo offers it online with 8GB for \n. One reason for buying direct is that you can buy three years of on-site support for \u00a348.96.\nHowever, memory is so cheap, I don\u2019t see the point of buying a PC with 4GB of memory, unless you plan to add more. Last year I bought another 8GB (\u00a336) to take my desktop PC up to 16GB.\nYou would also get a much more responsive PC by buying a system with a faster processor, such as an Intel Core i3 or better (ie i5/i7/i9), or the equivalent AMD Ryzen processor and a 128GB or larger \n instead of a traditional hard drive.\nIf you can afford it, go for something like the \n (search for 590-p0057na) with a Ryzen 5 2400G, 8GB of memory, 128GB SSD and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99 at Argos. It\u2019s overkill for your likely needs, but it\u2019s good value. The \n with exactly the same spec costs \u00a3529 at PC World. The \n (who?) version at eBuyer has a 240GB SSD but lacks the 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99. This kind of spec should easily last more than five years.\nLarge businesses still buy desktop PCs in large volumes. They generally want something small, reliable and repairable. These machines are written off after a few years, refurbished, and sold to consumers and some small businesses. One of today\u2019s classic buys is the Dell OptiPlex 7010 SFF (\n), with the HP 8100 Elite SFF among the alternatives.\nOne drawback is that their old Intel Core chips aren\u2019t as good as today\u2019s versions. However, with 8GB of memory and, ideally, an SSD, they should be speedy enough for your purposes.\nThere are dozens of sources of refurbished OptiPlex PCs including \n, \n, \n and numerous Amazon and eBay sellers, though \n.\nTier1Online will add memory and storage, and extend the warranty, for a price, but it\u2019s cheaper to buy a low-end machine and upgrade it yourself. If you can.\nAt the moment, \n has some deals worth exploring. You could get a refurbished OptiPlex 7010 SFF with a Core i5-3470, 8GB, a 250GB hard drive, DVD and Windows 10 Professional for \n, or with a 128GB SSD instead of the hard drive, \n. And \n, despite being five years older.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/16/im-still-on-windows-7-what-should-i-do": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/16/im-still-on-windows-7-what-should-i-do", "title": "I\u2019m still on Windows 7 \u2013 what should I do?", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>Support for Windows 7 has ended, leaving Marcy wondering how they can protect themselves </p><p>I do a lot of work on a Windows 7 desktop PC that is about five years old.

Despite Microsoft\u2019s repeated warnings to Windows 7 users, there may still be \n, many of them in businesses. What should people do next?\nTo begin with, Windows 7 will not stop working, it will just stop receiving security updates. Users will therefore be more vulnerable to malware attacks, particularly from \u201c\n\u201d. We saw how dangerous that can be when WannaCry took over unpatched PCs in \n. It was so bad that \n, even though it was out of support.\nThere are reasons to be fearful, because of the way the malware industry works.\nOn the second Tuesday of every month, \n releases security patches that should be installed automatically by Windows Update. The malware industry analyses these patches to find the holes, and then looks for ways to exploit them. A lot of the code in Windows 10 goes back to Windows 7 and earlier versions. As a result, some of the security holes in Windows 10 will also be present in Windows 7, but they won\u2019t be patched.\n writers don\u2019t normally target out-of-date operating systems, because they don\u2019t usually have many users. In this case, as with XP, there could be millions of relatively easy targets.\nThe British government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \n: \u201cWe would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts.\u201d That\u2019s good advice.\nThe NCSC\u2019s website suggests some \u201c\n\u201d. It\u2019s aimed mainly at government departments and businesses, and isn\u2019t specific to Windows 7.\nThe core advice boils down to this: avoid coming into contact with any malware, and make sure you have nothing to lose. The first is basically impossible in a world where malware can be served via advertisements (\u201cmalvertising\u201d) even on respectable websites. The second is tedious but essential.\nWhile you can\u2019t patch Windows 7, you can \n. That applies to browsers in particular. Fortunately, the main browser suppliers will keep updating them, and \n: \u201cWe will continue to fully support Chrome on Windows 7 for a minimum of 18 months from Microsoft\u2019s end of life date, until at least 15 July 2021.\u201d\nEventually, however, they\u2019ll stop testing their browsers on \n because it\u2019s expensive and will only serve a shrinking number of users.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid malware completely, try to avoid untrusted or insecure websites. Major name-brand websites should be reasonably safe, including your bank\u2019s. Sources of free, pirated or \u201cadult\u201d stuff are generally less so. But, sooner or later, your bank will decide that it\u2019s too risky to deal with people who have vulnerable computers, and prevent you from logging on.\nRunning good anti-virus software and a firewall should help minimise the risk, so it may be worth paying for something like Kaspersky Total Security. However, no security software is foolproof, and it won\u2019t patch your unpatched operating system.\nYou must also be super-suspicious about emails, and never click unsolicited attachments. According to \n, spam and phishing emails caused 67% of ransomware infections in 2019, causing $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) worth of damage.\n and other serious attacks is not having anything to lose. Keep copies of all your valuable data on external hard drives and thumb-drives and possibly online, and as little as possible on your Windows 7 PC. Make daily backups to a storage device that is not otherwise attached to your PC, and keep a current disk image handy. You\u2019ll never have to pay a ransom if you can just wipe the infected drive and restore your PC from a backup.\nGiven the risks of running Windows 7, users should plan to replace it as soon as possible. The options include \n 10, Linux and CloudReady, which is based on Google\u2019s Chromium OS. In effect, it turns your PC into a Chromebook.\nWindows 10 is the best option for most ordinary Windows 7 users. Although it has some additional stuff, Windows 10 still has most of the features of Windows 7, and \n. It will run most, if not all, of your existing software, and you will have to do the least amount of relearning. Decades of Windows experience will still be useful.\nMicrosoft offered Windows 7 users a free in-place upgrade to Windows 10 during the year after its launch, and it would have been sensible to take it. Since then, you have been able to download a copy of Windows 10 and \n. So far, most users who have tried this and entered their Windows 7 product key have had their copy of Windows 10 authenticated. I can\u2019t say whether that will continue to work. However, Microsoft wants people off Windows 7 and on to Windows 10, so it\u2019s worth a go. Just skip the part where it asks for a product key, and leave it for later.\nIf you install Windows 10, you can use it for a month. After that, you will get a \u201cwatermark\u201d on your desktop that says it isn\u2019t authenticated, and Microsoft will nag you to do it. You will also lose personalisation options, so you won\u2019t be able to change the wallpaper, themes, lock screen and so on, but it will continue to work. Using an unauthenticated copy of Windows 10 is not a long-term solution, and it\u2019s a bad idea for businesses, which can \n. However, if you\u2019re a Windows 7 home user, it gives you more time to decide what to do.\nIf Windows 10 runs well on your PC, you might decide to pay to authenticate it. If it doesn\u2019t run well, you can still try a different option, such as \n, \n or \n.\nAlternatively, keep Windows 7 for offline use, and use a \u201clive Linux\u201d for internet access.\nMany people are familiar with the idea of running Linux from a \u201clive CD\u201d or DVD, which doesn\u2019t interfere with the current desktop operating system. There are not many DVD drives around nowadays, so the modern equivalent is to run it from a thumb-drive. You can create one with a tool such as \n or \n. Thumb-drives are slow, so you won\u2019t get great performance, but it will keep you safe online. You\u2019ll also find out if you can live with Linux.\nThe problem with buying Windows 10 Home from the Windows Store is the price: \n. You can buy laptops running Windows 10 for less than that, and usable laptops for not much more. For example, you could get a brand new \n (11.6in screen) from Argos for \u00a3159.99, or a \n (14in screen) for \u00a3179.99. Both have slow Intel Celeron N4000 processors and 4GB of memory, and they are called \u201ccloudbooks\u201d because of their limited 64GB of storage. Like Chromebooks, they are designed to work online. Unlike Chromebooks, they can run Microsoft Office and other Windows programs.\nA better buy would be an \n with a Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3239.99 at eBuyer.\nAlternatively, you could buy a refurbished laptop or desktop already running Windows 10. For example, \n has a small ex-corporate HP desktop with a Core i3-3220 processor, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and one-year guarantee for \n. It has lots of ThinkPad laptops at prices from \n (X240 with an i3-4010U and 4GB) or less to \n (X1 Carbon with an i5-4210U, 8GB and a 128GB SSD) or more. Tier1Online will also add extra memory and SSDs to most of its machines, if required. You can extend the guarantee to three years for \u00a340.\nYou can also buy refurbished laptops from \n and various suppliers on Amazon or eBay. \n is a government-backed scheme that offers extra discounts to people on benefits, and there are \n.\nIf all else fails, you may be able to get a free laptop running Windows 10 from a recycling group such as \n or \n, or from a friend of a friend.\nWindows 7 hasn\u2019t been current since 2012, when Windows 8 was launched. Processors have advanced a lot since then, and SSDs have mostly replaced hard drives. Somebody else\u2019s cast-off PC may be newer and faster than the one you\u2019ve been using for five or 10 years.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search", "title": "How can I get better at using Google search?", "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:43 GMT", "summary": "<p>Michael struggles to find the search results he\u2019s looking for, and would like some tips for better Googling</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy\">Last week\u2019s column</a> mentioned search skills.

Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching \u2013 which is almost everyone \u2013 could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its \n algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn\u2019t deliver what they wanted.\nLater, \n added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else \u2013 or even a machine \u2013 to know.\nWhen talking about avoiding \u201c\n\u201d, former Google boss \n: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you\u2019ve been. We can more or less know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nGoogle hasn\u2019t got to that point, yet, but it does want to save you from typing. Today, Google does this through a combination of \n search suggestions, \n, and \u201c\n\u201d boxes, which show related questions along with their \u201c\n\u201d. As a result, Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research, about \n, and about 6% go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps.\nYou could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links.\nSo, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in \n \u2013 or perhaps not for as long.\nThe easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the \n, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words).\nYou can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it\u2019s a fallback if you forget any.\nHappily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable.\nIf you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results.\nPutting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people\u2019s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases.\nYou can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: \u201cI for one welcome our new insect overlords\u201d. Searching for \u201cI for one welcome our new * overlords\u201d finds other overlords such as aliens, \n, computers, robots and squirrels.\nNowadays, Google\u2019s \n is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include \u201c\n\u201d such as a, at, that, the and this. You don\u2019t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths.\nHowever, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don\u2019t want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car.\nGoogle also has a site: command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or, with a minus sign (-site:), exclude it. This command uses the site\u2019s uniform resource locator or \n.\nFor example, if you wanted to find something on the Guardian\u2019s website, you would type site:theguardian.com (no space after the colon) alongside your search words.\nYou may not need to search the whole site. For example, site:theguardian.com/technology/askjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online, though it doesn\u2019t search all the ancient texts (\n).\nThere are several similar commands. For example, inurl: will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their \n (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle: to find words in titles.\nWeb pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things, including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title, it should be one of the page\u2019s main topics.\nYou can also use site: and inurl: commands to limit searches to include, or exclude, whole groups of websites. For example, either site:co.uk or inurl:co.uk will search matching UK websites, though many UK sites now have .com addresses. Similarly, site:ac.uk and inurl:ac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions, while inurl:edu and site:edu will find American ones. Using inurl:ac.uk OR inurl:edu (the \n must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using site:gov.uk will find British government websites, and inurl:https will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers.\nGoogle Search can also find different types of file, using either filetype: or ext: (for file extension). These include office documents (docx, pptx, xlxs, rtf, odt, odp, odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example, a search for picasso filetype:pdf is more productive than one for stormzy.\nWe often want up-to-date results, particularly in technology where things that used to be true are not true any more. After you have run a search, you can use Google\u2019s time settings to filter the results, or use new search terms. To do this, click Tools, click the down arrow next to \u201cAny time\u201d, and use the dropdown menu to pick a time period between \u201cPast hour\u201d and \u201cPast year\u201d.\nLast week, I was complaining that Google\u2019s \u201cfreshness algorithm\u201d could serve up lots of blog-spam, burying far more useful hits. Depending on the topic, you can use a custom time range to get less fresh but perhaps more useful results.\nCustom time settings are even more useful for finding contemporary coverage of events, which might be \n, a \n, or \n. Human memories are good at rewriting history, but contemporaneous reports can provide a more accurate picture.\nHowever, custom date ranges have disappeared from mobile, the daterange: command no longer seems to work in search boxes, and \u201csort by date\u201d has gone except in news searches. Instead, this year, \n to do the same job. For example, you could search for \u201cApple iPod\u201d before:2002-05-31 after:2001-10-15 for a bit of nostalgia. The date formats are very forgiving, so one day we may all prefer it.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy", "title": "Can DuckDuckGo replace Google search while offering better privacy?", "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>The alternative search engine markets itself on protecting users\u2019 privacy, but is it worth using?</p><p>So is DuckDuckGo no good?

I have suggested this privacy-oriented search engine a few times since 2012, and I think it\u2019s worth a go. However, I\u2019m answering Murray\u2019s earlier query along the same lines because I can use his email verbatim rather than cobbling together a joint question from multiple sources.\nI will admit that Google is generally the best search engine. I was an early adopter and often recommended it. Google was also attractive because its home page wasn\u2019t stuffed with advertising, and because of the company\u2019s old motto: \u201c\n\u201d. This was a bit of a jab at competitors, who were said to be \u201ckind of exploiting the users to some extent\u201d. How times change.\nGoogle\u2019s prowess at search and its success at selling advertising created a virtuous circle. More users and more money led to bigger indexes of web pages, more servers and faster responses, along with better algorithms created by growing numbers of super-smart computer scientists. Adding Gmail, Maps and the Chrome browser reinforced its power. Nobody else could keep up.\n Search soon became one of the web\u2019s category-defining behemoths along with, for example, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, YouTube and Wikipedia.\nDominant web properties can decline dramatically \u2013 it happened to AOL and Yahoo, as \n shows \u2013 but most survive for a long time.\nTheoretically, upstarts can displace incumbents by using new technologies to offer an (initially) inferior but cheaper product to a larger market, as described in Clayton Christensen\u2019s book, \n. This appears to be impossible with Google Search, because its price is zero and its reach is almost unlimited. (Baidu dominates in China and Yandex is popular in Russia.) Google therefore looks impregnable, unless it loses its grip on the advertising market \u2013 no money, no search \u2013 or the US government intervenes.\nBut Google has a weakness, privacy, which DuckDuckGo attacks. Indeed, it describes itself as \u201cthe internet privacy company\u201d where Google is obviously \u201cthe internet advertising company\u201d.\nIt follows through with a Firefox extension, \n, its Privacy Weekly newsletter, a blog at \n, and \n. The blog offers practical advice, which includes suggesting \n.\nGoogle Search is free at the point of use, but the company makes more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) a year from advertising based on tracking and targeting users. DuckDuckGo is therefore undercutting Google \u201con price\u201d by not collecting any information, not storing your searches, and not tracking you across the web. This means it can\u2019t sell personalised advertising, and it can\u2019t deliver personalised search results. Also, governments can\u2019t get your data, because there isn\u2019t any.\nNone the less, DuckDuckGo does have ways to make money, and it is profitable. Mainly, it uses the old idea of selling ads against search queries. If you search for cars, you are likely to see car ads. This is probably how most search engines make most of their money.\nIn \n, DuckDuckGo argues that Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s business models \u201cdon\u2019t need to be this invasive. It is a choice to squeeze every last ounce of profit at the expense of privacy, democracy and society. A choice they don\u2019t have to make. Without all this tracking, I\u2019m confident they would still be among the most profitable companies in the world, and we\u2019d all be better off.\u201d\nGoogle should deliver the best search results because it has the biggest, freshest index of websites and the smartest search algorithms. However, this does not guarantee the best results. DuckDuckGo can compete because, sometimes, less is more.\nPersonalised search is great in theory but can be flawed in reality. For example, if people are wrong about, say, vaccinations or climate change, personalised search could end up reinforcing their misconceptions instead of correcting them. This is known as the \u201c\n\u201d problem.\nAlso, ultimately, it is more profitable for Google\u2019s algorithms to keep users clicking, even if they end up in a swamp of conspiracy theories on crackpot websites. Of which there are many.\nFurther, even the biggest, freshest web index may have drawbacks. Google\u2019s results can be swamped by blogspam \u2013 quick knockoffs of news stories that contain no original thought, and no original reporting. Good quality articles can get buried where hardly anybody will find them.\nGoogle tries to deliver the results most people want, which works because most people are terrible at searching. Even half-baked questions can get impressive results. But if you\u2019re an expert searcher, like me, Google\u2019s algorithms can seem to ignore what you\u2019ve typed in. In these circumstances, using the \u201cverbatim\u201d command forces Google to pay attention to the words in my query. It can make an astonishing difference to the results, but why should I have to do that?\nGoogle\u2019s search results have also been \u201cgamed\u201d for \n or \n reasons, or \n. This year, the \u201c\n\u201d of Game of Thrones Season 8 were \u201c\n\u201d. How far can you trust search results when members of a Reddit forum can manipulate them?\nA \n has been written by its founder, \n, on Quora. I\u2019m assuming you will read this, so I don\u2019t have to devote 1,000 words to describing it. Suffice it to say that DuckDuckGo works exactly how you would expect a search engine to work.\nOf course, you\u2019ll only find out how well DuckDuckGo works for you by trying it. I\u2019ll be amazed if it doesn\u2019t answer more than half your search queries, but if you want a second opinion, you can always send your current search to Google just by putting !g in front of it. No retyping required.\nThe stumbling blocks for me are: (1) DuckDuckGo\u2019s lack of custom date ranges, which both Google and Bing offer; and (2) it doesn\u2019t do reverse image searches, which I use for double-checking pictures posted on Facebook and Twitter.\nDuckDuckGo is a little less convenient than Google in that, as far as I can tell, you can\u2019t see the options for things like image search, maps, news and shopping without first doing a text search. However, you can send queries to other search engines from DuckDuckGo by using \n commands, as mentioned above. For example, starting a search query with !a will search Amazon, !m will search Google Maps, !r will search Reddit and !w will search Wikipedia.\nIf DuckDuckGo\u2019s ancillary searches don\u2019t work well enough for your purposes, don\u2019t go straight back to Google. \n, \n and \n are good alternatives to Google Maps. \n and reverse image searches are better than Google\u2019s. \n is competitive for news. \n is a great \u201ccomputation engine\u201d that can do many things better than Google, as well as many things Google cannot do.\nFinally, if you really don\u2019t like DuckDuckGo\u2019s main search results, there are lots of alternatives. \n, \n, \n and \n are all privacy oriented. Switzerland\u2019s Swisscows can draw \u201csemantic maps\u201d based on filtering results by their contexts (eg Windows OS updates vs windows and doors). France\u2019s Qwant uses the ampersand for the equivalent of bang commands (for example, &a searches Amazon and &w searches Wikipedia). \n and \n are both privacy-respecting metasearch engines, which means they base their results on other search engines. SearX.me is particularly impressive in the options it offers after you have run a search.\nYou will miss a few things if you stop using Google. You will miss far more if you never use anything else.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jan/27/johnson-huawei-compromise-uk-5g-network-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jan/27/johnson-huawei-compromise-uk-5g-network-video", "title": "Johnson: Huawei compromise would be 'strategic win for the UK' \u2013\u00a0video", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:04:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>Boris Johnson has hinted he will arrive at a solution over whether to let the Chinese company build parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network.

In this world, renting literally isn\u2019t an option.\nFor a generation of fans, that stands in stark contrast to real life. The Resolution Foundation, a housing thinktank, reported in 2018 that up to \n, and the number of households privately renting in England \n in the 10 years after 1996, according to the most recent Labour Force Survey. With young people disproportionately more likely to rent than older generations, many have turned to The Sims to decorate a house that feels like their own.\n\u201cRenting means your aesthetics are limited to pieces you can easily take with you and not bigger things like fixtures on the walls, window styles and paint jobs,\u201d says 29-year-old \n, who lives with their parents, a grandparent and a brother. \n\u201cWe also didn\u2019t want to do anything major in case the landlord raised any complaints,\u201d they explain. Howlane has found an outlet in The Sims, where the dream house they\u2019ve built is a modest two-bedroom place with a reasonably sized kitchen and room for some gym equipment. The modesty is touching, and somewhat sad \u2013 in real life, it\u2019s nothing more than a pipe dream.\nRhiannon Williams, 23, has lived in four rented homes over the past five years, all shared. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have others \u2013 especially a landlord \u2013 sharing the decision making, I could try things out and change the space more often,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Sims is definitely a medium I use to build those fantasies, and it\u2019s perfect for the flexibility aspect because it\u2019s so easy to make changes. I can try out a new sofa in moments rather than having two months of emails with my landlord to get approval!\u201d\nWilliams also craves stability, and a home where she can create long-term design plans. \u201cI think my real-life housing situation has affected how I play The Sims,\u201d she continues. \u201cI love the ability to create places that are always there to go back to, and that I can design and change to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d\nAccording to Roxy Wolosenko, a designer on the original game, that\u2019s what the game\u2019s creator, Will Wright, wanted to facilitate. \u201cHe was really interested in exploring how people felt in different kinds of spaces, and what makes people feel comfortable,\u201d she says. The inspiration for the game was the architect and theorist Christopher Alexander, whose 1977 book A Pattern Language sought to teach people the fundaments of home design in an accessible way.\nFor two decades The Sims has offered the joy of design, without the risk of angering a housemate or, worse, a landlord. The game presents a utopian world of home ownership, where everybody starts out with the same opportunities and can progress from a single-bedroom apartment to a vast palatial mansion as long as they put in the effort. It\u2019s no wonder fans have drawn considerable comfort from building homes that truly feel theirs \u2013 even if it is just a fantasy.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing", "title": "And relax \u2026 the joy of video games where you do almost nothing", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:03:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>More and more people are using games like quiet background experiences, requiring minimal attention while they sew, cook or study</p><p>In the recently released game <a href=\"http://coffeetalk.info/\">Coffee Talk</a>, you play a coffee-shop barista who stands at a counter, through long, rainy Seattle nights, making drinks for customers as they tell you about their lives.

Elves tell you about their love lives, insomniac werewolves seek calm and quiet \u2013 you listen and you try to make drinks that will soothe them.\nCoffee Talk comes from a long line of quietly transgressive games that don\u2019t ask much of the player, that defy the popular notion of video games as a hectic, dizzying pursuit where buttons are bashed and the onscreen action is intense and demanding. \n, like music, can sometimes sit in the background, asking for little more than occasional check-ins. In the early 1980s, I loved to travel vast distances in the space simulation game Elite, watching the pixel stars and hollow planets swoop by, perhaps encountering the odd freighter. I\u2019d put the game on in the background while I did my homework.\nLater, PC owners all over the world were transfixed by Myst, the slow, silent puzzle game that had you visiting almost still images of a deserted island, in between spreadsheet chores. The visual novel genre, vastly popular in Japan, requires little more from players than button presses to select conversational options \u2013 playing Steins;Gate, \n or \n is like checking in with a WhatsApp chat, just one with more Japanese high schools, trans-dimensional monsters and interspecies\u2019 dating than usual.\nOpen world games have become hangouts for a lot of players. You can sit on a hill in Minecraft and watch the sun travel across the sky; you can park your car in Grand Theft Auto V and the world moves around you. A few days ago, I tweeted asking friends for the games they treated like quiet background music. Lots of people mentioned gentle life sims such as \n and Stardew Valley, which writer Ria Jenkins told me she plays while watching Love Island; several opted for professional sims such as Euro Truck Simulator and \n, where you just drop in on a job and carry out mundane tasks. Xbox social strategist and streamer Charleyy Hodson talked about the multiplayer game \n: \u201cMy entire family loves checking in once a day, planting some new crops and picking some flowers. Then we come back the next day to check in again.\u201d\nExperimental indie games often fulfil this role as an unobtrusive element in our endlessly partial attention spans. The exploration mode in action adventure Concrete Genie, the road movie-like Jalopy, the letter-writing game Kind Words \u2013 can be checked in on or left running. Guardian contributor and Gadget Show presenter \n plays the Shakespearean comedy game Astrologaster while doing cross stitch, \u201cjust pressing a button every now and then to advance things\u201d.\nFor many people, the arrival of \u201cappointment\u201d games on Facebook and mobile phones \u2013 such as Farmville and Words With Friends, where you check in and out on the experience throughout the day \u2013 provided a gateway to the idea that games don\u2019t have to be all-consuming. At the same time, our modern dual-screen culture of watching TV while browsing a smartphone or tablet device, has prepared for us a mental space in which seemingly competing inputs can be experienced concurrently.\nCoffee Talk is clever in that it holds the player in a transient social space, where people flit in and out, giving us glimpses of other lives, and it provides no time pressures, no long-term goals. You\u2019re just there. You just listen and serve. It feels authentic and lived in, and it is \u2013 as Kris Antoni Hadiputra, founder of Toge Productions, the Indonesian studio behind the game explains:\nVideo games are about interactivity, of course, but interactivity doesn\u2019t have to mean ceaselessly hitting buttons and guiding an on-screen character, vehicle or weapon. Interactivity can mean quietly inhabiting a space, or just checking in on it, and for a few seconds lending our attention to something benign and beguiling.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen", "title": "The Sims at 20: two decades of life, love and reorganising the kitchen", "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:03:10 GMT", "summary": "<p>In The Sims, if you get a job, buy a house and earn more money then happiness will follow.

One thing creator Will Wright realised very early on was that the game was appealing to a large female audience.

A friend\u2019s mother played so much Sims that she forgot to clean the actual house for weeks.\nMortifyingly, some teen pals and I used The Sims 2 to insert ourselves into elaborate Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanfiction. A university classmate created the cast of Friends, and used them to play out a drama that was definitely better than the final season of the show. My own personal obsession with The Sims was so all-consuming that when The Sims 3 arrived in 2009, I had to cut myself off in case I failed my degree. One of my lecturers, spotting The Sims open on my laptop in class, admitted to the worryingly common virtual crime of drowning his Sims in their own pool by deleting the ladders.\nPart of the appeal of video games is control \u2013 not just the act of controlling a character\u2019s actions, but the greater control of understanding a set of rules and systems and bending them to your will. The Sims is so enormously compelling because it offers the fantasy of control over life itself, including all the things that are so maddeningly unpredictable in the real world \u2013 relationships, careers, family, house renovations. The rules of The Sims essentially state that if you work hard and do everything you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 get a job, buy a house, progress through the ranks to earn more money and buy more stuff \u2013 happiness will follow. It\u2019s a beguiling capitalist fantasy \u2013 and even if things aren\u2019t going well, you can always type in the \u201cmotherlode\u201d cheat code to shower yourself in riches.\nIn the 20 years since the original Sims arrived to distract us all from homework and housework (with virtual homework and housework), the series has evolved and expanded, its underlying artificial intelligence code becoming ever more sophisticated. Where originally Sims were miniature automatons, later they developed personalities, aspirations and foibles alongside their basic needs for food, money and toilet facilities. They even developed free will: from The Sims 2 onwards you could flip a switch and the simulation would play out without your input, the Sims making decisions about whom to hook up with and how long to spend in the bath, according to their own virtual whims.\nSome of my favourite times with The Sims have come when the little people are operating independently of me, sometimes so uncannily that it freaked me out. Once, as a teen, I created a replica of my real-life home to see what would happen, and it generated such an accurate facsimile of our family dynamic \u2013 dad yelling at my slobby brother to get off the couch, me arguing with my mum in the kitchen, me writing furiously in a diary late into the night \u2013 that I started to wonder if we weren\u2019t \n. And I wasn\u2019t even a fan of the Simulation Hypothesis. Or high.\nNew games have sent Sims off to college, seen them celebrate birthdays and engagements and new year parties, introduced pets and tiny houses and mermaids. And have you \nwhat Sims fans are doing nowadays? A vast, dedicated community of crafters has made hundreds of thousands of new things to adorn Sim dwellings. Some make an actual living building perfect houses or directing Sims soap operas on YouTube. And of course, they\u2019ve made countless explicit sex mods.\nThe Sims is more than a dolls\u2019 house for the digital generation. In many respects it is a post-literate utopia, powered by love and money. There is no racial prejudice, no gender pay gap. Gay marriage arrived in The Sims years before it did in real life. And as its simulation has become ever more clever, it has let players experiment not simply with home decor and fashions, but with human nature and motivation. Players have used The Sims to explore everything from their own gender identity, to complicated family dynamics, to what would happen if you \n and made them have sex.\nI sometimes wonder what The Sims would be like if it were closer to how real life actually worked \u2013 if it saddled you with crippling university debt, made you pay extortionate rent on a tiny flat instead of letting you build your dream home, had you chasing after people who\u2019ll never love you back and working for years without earning the promotion you deserve. But a more realistic Sims would be depressing to play, because really, the point of The Sims is to make life\u2019s everyday trials, labours and rituals seem fun and full of possibilities. Has a video game ever had a more valuable and worthwhile aim?\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games", "title": "What Pok\u00e9mon can teach us about storytelling", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 07:00:45 GMT", "summary": "<p>Since 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon games have exerted a fascination for fans, telling imaginative stories and encouraging a generation of players to question everything they see</p><p>\u201cThis is it?

My boyfriend, who has never played Pok\u00e9mon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so \u2026\n.\u201d\nI consider, for the first time, what the \n games look like to a person who has never played them. They \n slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The \u201cbattles\u201d you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the \u201cmoves\u201d? You see very little of them. Rattata uses \u201ctackle\u201d and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.\nWhy have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pok\u00e9mon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Pok\u00e9mon, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The guilt you feel when it\u2019s time to bench your Pidgeot \u2013 the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 \u2013 because you know he can\u2019t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. \nThe game encourages you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style \u201cFind the princess!\u201d prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.\nOne visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pok\u00e9mon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pok\u00e9mon \u201cfaint\u201d if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we\u2019ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pok\u00e9mon die and they are mourned.\nThat\u2019s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: \u201cGhosts appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Tower. I think they\u2019re the spirits of Pok\u00e9mon that the Rockets killed.\u201d\nSo Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of \n and \n, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. \nTake the gym leaders. These are the game\u2019s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock\u2019s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge\u2019s deranged Electric-type gym you\u2019re forced to sort through trash before he\u2019ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate \u2013 do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that\u2019s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it\u2019s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pok\u00e9mon.\nFrom the beginning, Pok\u00e9mon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave \n about the mysterious and elusive Pok\u00e9mon named Mew, which was added to Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. \u201cThere were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,\u201d Tajiri explained. \u201cIt created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there \u2026 It kept the interest alive.\u201d\nFor decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player; for years, many players believed that Mew was \n.\nThe sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly guardians, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric \n, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn\u2019t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pok\u00e9mon who are willing to fight for you \u2013 it all makes sense.\nAs a novelist, I\u2019m keenly aware that people won\u2019t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience; it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pok\u00e9mon games, if I weren\u2019t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: \u201cI like shorts. They\u2019re comfy and easy to wear.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll understand.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime", "title": "Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore review \u2013 an enchanting world of wannabe idols", "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 07:00:18 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Switch; Atlus/Nintendo</strong><br>A group of magical youngsters do battle on the streets of Tokyo in this endearing, addictive anime-like role-playing game</p><p>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore is an unlikely candidate for mainstream success in the western market.

This time around, Townsend is the coach, and Finn Russell is the player on the out.\nThe comparison is not exact. Russell was cut because of that \n, the Scottish Rugby Union\u2019s polite euphemism for a drinking jag and going awol from training the next day.

You do not need to be a devotee of Hughes\u2019s brand of \n to appreciate that skipping training is not one of them.\nBut that was a while back already, and does not explain why Russell is still not being considered for selection. \u201c\n. The word is he is still \n. In the background of all this is the row between Russell\u2019s father, Keith, and the SRU. He was the director of domestic rugby until he was sacked in 2017. He sued them for unfair dismissal and won a six-figure settlement in an employment tribunal. The fallout did not reflect well on the SRU\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dodson. \n and that the case put his son \n. They are a close family.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very aware of how the SRU has treated myself and so it\u2019s made it really difficult for him this year to go out, whether it\u2019s Glasgow at Scotstoun or Scotland at Murrayfield, knowing there are people in the stand who have just summarily dismissed his father with no justification, with no process or anything else,\u201d Keith said at the time.\nKeith\u2019s wife, \n \u201cit used to be like a dream\u201d to watch her boy playing for Scotland, but that \u201cnow it is for ever tainted.\u201d\nWhen Russell decided to move to Racing 92, Dodson said the SRU could not compete with the \u201csuperstar money\u201d on offer in France. Keith Russell claimed they had not tried, because they never made Finn an offer to stay. \n.\nTownsend has been around Scottish rugby long enough to have lived through similar rows, and he might have found a way round all this. But at the same time his relationship with Russell appears to have broken down. Scott Hastings described it on Sky this week as a \u201cclash of personalities\u201d. It first blew up at Twickenham last year, during Scotland\u2019s 38-38 draw with England. They had been cut to pieces in that first half, but in the second Russell sparked an astonishing comeback. He set up two tries and scored a third himself.\nIt was one of the great displays of spontaneous attacking rugby, of a kind Russell does better than almost any other player around. And it grew out of a row with Townsend. \u201cI actually had an argument with Gregor,\u201d Russell told ITV after the match. \u201cI said to him: \u2018You\u2019re telling us to kick and when we kick, they just run it back and cut us open, and when we run it, they\u2019re just hitting us behind the gain line and winning the ball back.\u2019 Second half, we just came out with nothing to lose, played our rugby, kicked out of our half and scored some great tries. We played good Scottish rugby.\u201d\n. \u201cFinn and Gregor just kind of having a big domestic. It was more about tactics. I think we kicked a lot in the first half, it didn\u2019t really work and we needed to change it. Gregor wasn\u2019t really happy. You\u2019ve got some people who say things just to be heard, for their voice to be recognised. But when Finn says something, he\u2019s saying it for a reason. You\u2019ve got one guy who\u2019s out on the park getting eaten up and spat back out. Then you\u2019ve got another who\u2019s just angry. These two guys come head-to-head.\u201d\nA year later, it feels as if Scotland are still trying to figure out exactly what \u201cgood Scottish rugby\u201d looks like, but it seems pretty clear that Townsend and Russell do not always agree on it. The hectic, high-tempo, approach they have used in the last two years came up short at the World Cup, and Townsend and his new captain, Stuart Hogg, are trying to develop a cannier, more cautious style.\nHogg made some telling comments at the \n launch, when he was asked if Scotland needed to work on their game management. No one mentioned Russell. Until he did: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a guy like Finn Russell at 10 who just wants to chuck the pill about the paddock all the time, you\u2019ve got to rein him in every now and then,\u201d Hogg said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t score points in our own half unless it\u2019s massively on for us to chuck the ball about, and for us now it\u2019s about when to play and when to kick.\u201d There are echoes here of the rows Townsend used to have with his coach Jim Telfer, only this time he is on the other side of the argument.\nRussell, who was part of Scotland\u2019s senior players group, has stayed in touch with the talented young fly-half who has replaced him, Adam Hastings, and they spoke on the Friday night before the Ireland game. It seems his relations with Townsend, though, still have a way to go. England at least, will be grateful. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d Eddie Jones said the last time England came up to Murrayfield, when Russell orchestrated a 25-13 win, and one they will be happy they do not have to face on Saturday.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/manchester-united-file-complaint-against-sun-over-woodward-house-attack": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/manchester-united-file-complaint-against-sun-over-woodward-house-attack", "title": "Manchester United file complaint against Sun over Woodward house attack", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 21:01:00 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Club believe tabloid had advance notice of incident<br />\u2022 The Sun says it \u2018vigorously defends its right to report\u2019<p>Manchester United believe the Sun newspaper had \u201cadvance notice\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/fans-attack-home-ed-woodward-manchester-united\" title=\"\">the attack on the house of Ed Woodward</a> and have filed a complaint to Ipso, the media watchdog.</p><p>The incident occurred on 28 January, when a group wearing balaclavas launched flares at the Cheshire home of the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman.

The quality of the images accompanying the story indicate that a photographer was also present.

Archer might be tempted to post something similar in response to the news \n that has only now been diagnosed correctly.\nI told you I had a serious, debilitating injury: one I\u2019ve played with since the World Cup while bowling more overs than any other England cricketer. And while simultaneously being accused, sotto voce, of not always trying, of being a complex character, of not \u201cletting rip\u201d when the team demanded it.\nIn the meantime, well, not exactly a surprise, is it? In play-writing there\u2019s a principle known as Chekhov\u2019s gun. This dictates that if there\u2019s a rifle hanging above the fireplace in Act One, it\u2019s going to be fired at someone\u2019s head by the end of Act Five.\nA similar process applies to England cricket, fast bowlers and any kind of unorthodox, non-standard talent. Stick all three of them on the same stage and you can be pretty sure before long the air will be thick with gunpowder smoke, wrong turns and a generalised fug of error and confusion.\nLet\u2019s not dress it up. Archer has been miserably treated this winter, and only occasionally by the opposition. He has carried a serious injury, undiagnosed. He\u2019s been rebuked for riding a Segway, thereby embarrassing his coaches in front of the CEO, a tier-one crime against the blue Lycra hierarchy. He\u2019s been asked to bowl 42 overs in his first overseas Test, or 5% of all the balls he\u2019d ever bowled in first-class cricket. He\u2019s been in tears after failing a fitness test in Johannesburg he should never, with hindsight, have been asked to take.\nLook clearly and Archer is entirely blameless in all of these things: a self-made 24-year-old cricketer, an inspiring story against the odds, and a man who might smile to himself at being lectured on toughness in adversity by the pathway products around him. So what is happening here?\nTwo things stand out. First, Archer is an outsider in so many ways in the narrow parish of elite English cricket. It isn\u2019t simply the fact he grew up in Barbados, or is a rare black male cricketer to earn a full ECB contract. It\u2019s also the fact he\u2019s from another place as a sportsman, talked about as though he\u2019s some bright-eyed creature found shivering in the treeline, the guy who wears his jumper around his waist, who doesn\u2019t carry the familiar signifiers of this sealed sporting-industrial life.\nStatements such as these should be seen in the context of both these layers of otherness: \u201cHe needs to ramp it up more ... The energy and effort have to be there all the time.\u201d \u201cWe want every ball to be an effort ball.\u201d \u201cYour body hurts at times ... You\u2019ve just got to choose to do it, really.\u201d \u201cCulturally he is different.\u201d\nThe words, there, of England\u2019s captain, head coach and director of cricket at various times this winter. Speaking, to be clear, about a bloke bowling through a stress fracture, while leading England\u2019s attack in his first season of international cricket. All of these quotes are set in the middle of warm words about Archer\u2019s performances, all couched with sympathetic talk about how much he is putting in. But still, there are words and phrases that jar. Trying hard. Culture. Effort. \u201cYes, this does hurt, son. But get on with it, eh?\u201d\nPlus we\u2019ve had the standard klaxon-parping talk about body language, about unacceptable diet, about the need to really \u201cbust a gut\u201d in training. Nobody else gets this stuff. Nobody mentions Stuart Broad\u2019s up-and-down intensity levels, the sense of a bowler (successfully and correctly) looking after himself. Nobody urges Joe Root himself to put \u201cmore effort\u201d in or talks about mental fragility when he keeps getting out just past 50. Why not?\nI\u2019m not qualified to define the mechanics of being a black athlete in a white sporting culture. But you do see patterns, faint memories of the way football has been, echoes of Daniel Sturridge (but not Andy Carroll) being accused of having \u201ca low pain threshold\u201d or Ron Noades talking about the need for hard white players to get you through the winter.\nI don\u2019t think this is conscious, or founded in ill-will. But it strikes a false note. More to the point, it won\u2019t help get the best out of a stellar, highly specialised cricketing talent. Clearly there is a need to take a look at how England\u2019s homogeneous \u201cteam culture\u201d deals with difference, outsiderdom and unusual ways of being a highly talented cricketer.\nThis isn\u2019t just about accepting some people walk and speak and respond a little differently. It\u2019s about the need to take care of a once-in-a-generation athlete who can bowl his second ball at 92mph, and who should be treated with the level of informed sports science his talent demands.\nThe issue of \u201cover-bowling\u201d will of course rumble around, a process that feels like using your handcrafted Glock pistol to bang in a fence post, but which is above all a sign of confusion.\nThe only people I\u2019ve heard talk compelling sense about Archer are Mike Selvey, who compared his style to Jeff Thomson, and seemed to say if you think Archer\u2019s not trying you don\u2019t understand the mechanics of fast bowling; and Archer\u2019s coach at the Rajasthan Royals, who works specifically on short bursts, on understanding his specific physicality, his personality, the way his body works.\nFor now a quiet apology and a reboot in the relationship would be a good start. Handled right, Archer can be a source of delight. This is what success looks like: right there. Time perhaps to ask him what he needs, rather than tell him.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/07/england-scotland-murrayfield-six-nations-calcutta-cup-eddie-jones-absence-power-creative": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/07/england-scotland-murrayfield-six-nations-calcutta-cup-eddie-jones-absence-power-creative", "title": "Absence of power athletes means England must get creative at Murrayfield | Ugo Monye", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:03:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>Eddie Jones does not have the players to simply blast through Scotland, so guile and speed will have to be to the fore</p><p>England arrive at Murrayfield a wounded animal.

Add in the number of changes made by Eddie Jones, plus the six-day turnaround, and England\u2019s challenge becomes all the more difficult.\nWe have plenty of soundbites about the passion and the mutual hatred with these sides. We have heard how Eddie wants to unleash his very own \u201cBomb Squad\u201d on Scotland and take them on up front but I desperately hope the devil has been in the detail for England this week.\nEddie does not normally make so many changes \u2013 by his standards this is fairly radical \u2013 and he has picked six forwards on the bench, which is to some extent a statement of intent, but he could have named eight and he would still not have the power and the gainline threat posed when he has both Vunipolas, Manu Tuilagi and Ben Te\u2019o at his disposal. Mako is back but Jones still does not have the players to blast through Scotland and he has picked what must be the most lightweight backline of his tenure. That means it is time to get creative again.\nFor all the possession England had in Paris, I\u2019m not sure they created any genuine try-scoring opportunities other than two moments of brilliance from Jonny May. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s an anomaly because England are normally so deadly in the 22 but they weren\u2019t able to convert that possession and territory into points. Losing Manu causes an obvious problem but I also see it as an opportunity.\nManu is an obvious handful and his sheer size and presence can create quick ball but there are plenty of other ways to do that. Whether that\u2019s running at shoulders, varying options at the line, slickness of handling, the pace at which you run at the line \u2013 it\u2019s a fallacy to say that you have to be a certain weight or size to get over the gain line. The weather is forecast to be dreadful but that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot be creative.\nI look at England\u2019s midfield of George Ford, Owen Farrell and Jonathan Joseph. They need to be at their slickest and the blueprint for that is \n. Their detail off first phase was excellent in that 61-21 win and I really hope they have spent all week honing that kind of detail. Joseph scored a hat-trick that day and two of his tries were very similar. England got into a great attacking shape, presented different options, picked the right ones, ran the right lines and at such speed. It was among the most exhilarating performances I\u2019ve seen from this England attack.\nIt is understandable but England have gone away from that in the last couple of years. When Eddie has had so many power athletes at his disposal it has come to dominate the gameplan. It is no wonder when you see how effective it has been against New Zealand at the World Cup or against Ireland in Dublin, but sometimes you can forget the other skillsets you have when you can rely on big ball carriers beating defenders around the corner and getting over the gainline. It can be devastating but England do not have that in their armoury at the moment.\nSo they need to show a bit more guile and bring tempo to everything they do. \n they had the power athletes but look at how they began that match. The lineout over the top to Manu in the first minute or two \u2026 they did not give Ireland a chance to catch their breath. The stats back up the need for England to start fast because in their last 20 fixtures England have been the team to score first on 15 occasions. Of those matches, they have gone on to win 13, drawing once, against Scotland last year, and losing only once, by a point to New Zealand. In the five matches in which they have gone behind they have gone on to lose three times.\nThe focus needs to be on creativity, speed of ball and line speed. Of course England need front-foot ball to do that and that probably explains why Lewis Ludlam comes in to the side to add another breakdown threat. By the same token, it\u2019s a shame Luke Cowan-Dickie has been ruled out, because he is incredible over the ball.\nIt has come about through injury rather than design, but it is also worth noting Joseph\u2019s ability in defence. I believe he is the best defensive outside-centre England have and if Scotland are going to look to go coast-to-coast all the time, he\u2019s the best option Eddie has to shut that down. I\u2019d expect England to get off the line with far greater desire and urgency than last week and Joseph is wonderful at that umbrella defence, shutting down those wider channels, getting into the eyeline of Adam Hastings and making him hesitate. It\u2019s all the more important against a team who don\u2019t kick a lot \u2013 Scotland only kicked 10 times from open play \n.\nFinally, what happens if and when the tide does turn against England? When Scotland get on a roll? Whenever you feel like you are under the pump, whether it\u2019s a few mistakes or negative actions in a row, conceding a try or a couple of penalties in a row, you have to manufacture moments of calm and quiet on the pitch. After 10 minutes you must create a break in play, whether it\u2019s a dodgy contact lens or whatever it is, you go into a huddle, you have your generals discussing what they are seeing on the pitch. Against France it might have been: \u201cWe\u2019re getting beaten up at the breakdown and we\u2019ve had X number of penalties against so we have to chuck more space out wide.

The forecast for the final game in Johannesburg on Sunday is also stormy.\nIt promises to be a similarly make-do affair in any case, as Eoin Morgan talked openly after this game about not going out to win the series but instead using it to find out more about his players. \u201cIt won\u2019t be about picking the strongest team,\u201d Morgan said.\nThis seems understandable from an England point of view. But in isolation it is a fairly startling admission at any level of sport and presumably not one that was included in the pre-series marketing. Morgan also spoke about the \u201cgreat energy\u201d Ben Stokes has been injecting behind the scenes. Which is no doubt a great thing for the England team but not so much for the paying spectators of Kingsmead.\nThe truncated day made for a frustrating tableau on a white-ball tour that still feels as though it has barely revved out of second gear. England picked an unchanged team in Durban, a chance for those who were easily cuffed aside in Cape Town to reassert their credentials. South Africa brought in the left-arm spinner Bjorn Fortuin to make his debut in place of Lungi Ngidi, another step in the host nation\u2019s own ongoing rebuild.\nEngland won the toss and bowled on a pitch that was miraculously fit to play despite the torrential gusts of water pouring from the skies before the start. Morgan had spoken about the need to create pressure in the field despite coming here armed with a depleted bowling attack.\nEngland opened up again with Chris Woakes, bowling to two slips in conditions that seemed tailored to his best snaking length with the new ball. His first ball was a zinger that seamed past Quinton de Kock\u2019s outside edge. After which Woakes bowled a little straight to both left- and right-handers.\nFrom the other end Sam Curran began with a 78mph wide and was then pulled and driven to the fence with elegant ease by Reeza Hendricks. Curran is at his most effective bowling with the new ball, England insist. But how effective is that? What level of effectiveness are we talking here?\nJoe Root came on first change and almost immediately removed De Kock with a ball that rushed on and drew a half-and-half prod. Root had been grabbing the ball and sprinting back to his mark. Certainly De Kock seemed only half switched on as the ball pinged back his leg stump. \u201cJoe\u2019s an underrated bowler,\u201d Morgan pointed out at the end.\nHendricks played with some fluency at the other end but the rain returned with South Africa on 38 for one after 6.3 overs. Five hours later the players were back out in hope of completing the reduced game. There was a brief sparkle of action. Tom Curran resumed from the Friendship Pavilion end and saw his fourth ball swung high over midwicket for six by Temba Bavuma to the whoops and cheers of a grateful, scattered crowd.\nThe final act before the players were off again was the dismissal of Bavuma, lbw on review to a ball from Chris Jordan that he tried to pull. Not much has gone emphatically right for England in this series to date. But Jordan has dismissed Bavuma twice in the space of 12 balls, both lbw. After a brief hokey-cokey the rains returned with a vengeance and the day was done. England will hope for a shift of pressure in Johannesburg.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/saracens-champions-cup-expulsion-ineligible-player-misconduct-hearing-rugby-union": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/saracens-champions-cup-expulsion-ineligible-player-misconduct-hearing-rugby-union", "title": "Saracens risk Champions Cup expulsion over fielding 'ineligible' player", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:24:34 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Troubled Saracens face Lamositele hearing on Friday night<br></li><li>Champions are due to play Leinster in April quarter-final</li></ul><p>Saracens\u2019 Champions Cup defence could be under threat after it emerged that prop Titi Lamositele may have been ineligible to play against Racing 92 last month.

With six Saracens players in the England XV and another on the bench it was hardly ideal preparation on the eve of a match they must win to keep their championship hopes alive.\nEddie Jones\u2019s side were already anticipating a rough ride at Murrayfield with the England head coach describing Scotland as a \u201cniggly, goading\u201d side and memories of a fracas in the tunnel in 2018 still fresh. Going back further, a group of bagpipers blocked the way to the England dressing room in 2012.\nSam Underhill first tasted this fixture two years ago, coming off the bench but swiftly earning himself a yellow card as Scotland went on to clinch as 25-13 victory. Underhill admitted that after a lacklustre performance against France last time out, \u201cthe pressure is on\u201d but had a note of caution for the 10 members of England\u2019s 23-man squad preparing for a Murrayfield Test for the first time.\n\u201cIt was one of my first caps and first experience here at Murrayfield. It was probably my first insight into the emotion of the occasion and I was probably a bit naive to it before, getting booed off the bus and seeing the reaction of the Scotland players when they won, seeing the crowd and how much it means to everyone up here,\u201d said Underhill, who has a Scottish grandmother from the Borders. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something to acknowledge and it\u2019s definitely there \u2013 you can\u2019t ignore it \u2013 especially when it\u2019s as loud as Murrayfield is.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a bit of an edge to a game. Sports in general and rugby definitely, a few people have probably thought it\u2019s gone away from those rivalries and what underlies them, but having that edge is definitely a good thing for the game.\u201d\nEngland \n last year but found themselves 38-31 down after Finn Russell inspired a thrilling Scotland comeback, only for a late George Ford try to salvage a draw. Russell is still out of the picture for Scotland but England are equally wary of Adam Hastings\u2019s mercurial talents and his ability to spark his side\u2019s attack into life.\n\u201cI think you can learn a lot from previous internationals,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cEveryone has slight trends and tendencies. The game has become extremely unstructured so it\u2019s important to be able to adapt in that chaos. That\u2019s something that we want to get better at and something that we\u2019re focused on in our preparation.\u201d\nThe Six Nations organisers and the Scottish Rugby Union are continuing to monitor Storm Ciara closely with gusts of 50mph expected in Edinburgh. The Scotland captain Stuart Hogg believes his side will have a few \u201ctricks up their sleeve\u201d but Mitchell is adamant England can cope with the expected conditions.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re ready for anything,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly in our preparation. We\u2019ve looked at all situations that could occur and weather is certainly one of those. It\u2019s important for us to be adaptable in those situations. I\u2019m not sure who it will favour. Certainly both teams will have to adapt to it. Should it come then it\u2019s adapting to what it presents in each of the halves.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/chess-magnus-carlsen-betting-sponsor-deal-dispute-fide": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/chess-magnus-carlsen-betting-sponsor-deal-dispute-fide", "title": "Chess: Magnus Carlsen\u2019s betting sponsorship deal risks Fide dispute", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:07:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 Carlsen to be global ambassador for Unibet in 2020-21<br>\u2022 Fide official: \u2018You can forget about this logo in Fide events\u2019</p><p>Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, has signed a controversial new two-year sponsorship deal for 2020-21 which could put the Norwegian, 29, on a collision course with the global chess body Fide.</p><p>Carlsen\u2019s agreement is with the Malta-based Kindred Group, which owns the sports betting firm Unibet, where chess is one of its specialities.

Unibet sponsored the 2014 Stavanger elite tournament but, because promotion of foreign gambling companies is illegal in Norway, they did so under the banner of \u201cNo Logo Norway Chess\u201d.\nCarlsen will be the Unibet \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d, wearing its logo and promoting it everywhere except at home due to Norwegian law. Already last year he supported Kindred in its unsuccessful attempt to forge a link with the Norwegian \n Federation. After that his own club, Offerspill, accepted its \u20ac400,000 backing to support young Norwegian talent.\nIndications from reader comments on major chess websites are that many fans view the choice of a gambling firm as lacking in gravitas for a world champion. For several years previously Carlsen\u2019s uncontroversial sponsor was the Norwegian investment bank Arctic Securities.\nFide\u2019s international director, Mohamed Al-Mudahka, raised an immediate red flag. The Qatar grandmaster, whose wife, the former world women\u2019s champion Zhu Chen, is Fide\u2019s treasurer, tweeted: \u201cYou can forget about this logo in Fide events.\u201d The implication is that Carlsen could be on a collision course with the global chess body if he tries to promote Unibet during his world title match in November.\nReality will be more complicated but may become clearer once the host city for the 14-game, \u20ac2m series, and the winner of the candidates in Ekaterinburg are known. Carlsen has not signed a Fide contract for the championship match and there is an unspoken implication that in extreme circumstances, with no agreement, he could go it alone.\nTo counter that, Fide\u2019s preferred candidates winner is probably the US favourite Fabiano Caruana, who is current No2, all-time No3, and the narrowly defeated 2018 challenger. Caruana closed his rating gap to Carlsen to 20 points with his runaway victory at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee. Since Carlsen has announced he is taking time off \u201cto break and regroup\u201d, Caruana will have a serious chance to capture the No1 rating if he wins by a clear margin over 14 games in Ekaterinburg.\nThere are precedents for the clear No1 champion acting independently. In the pre-Fide era both Emanuel Lasker and Alexander Alekhine made their own match deals, bypassing strong opponents such as Akiba Rubinstein and a return match Alekhine v Jose Raoul Capablanca. In Soviet times, a return match clause excessively favoured Mikhail Botvinnik.\nBobby Fischer negotiated unsuccessfully with Anatoly Karpov for the \u201cAbsolute World Championship of Chess Professionals\u201d. Garry Kasparov also wanted to go it alone, but Karpov was unwilling, so his break with Fide was deferred until Nigel Short became the challenger. Kasparov\u2019s rival body, the Professional Chess Association, worked well only as long as it had backing from the technology giant Intel, and he later wrote that his split with Fide was a mistake.\nSix weeks to go before the opening round of the eight-man world championship candidates at Ekaterinburg, and the coronavirus epidemic is causing serious problems for China\u2019s Wang Hao and Ding Liren, who will be competing against rivals from Russia, the US, Azerbaijan, and the Netherlands.\nWang Hao, who took second prize at the Gibraltar Masters last week, had a training camp in Beijing arranged for himself and his aides this month, but that event has now been cancelled. Instead, the 30-year-old will stay in Tokyo for a month before travelling to Russia.\nThis was \n. Taking the initiative as Black in a 3 Nd2 c5 French, his rook and pawn systematically outmanoeuvre White\u2019s pair of bishops.\nThe situation is worse for Ding Liren, the world No3 and second favourite in Ekaterinburg after Caruana. Ding lives with his parents in his coastal home city Wenzhou, which has nine million inhabitants and 300 hospitalised virus cases.\nHe had intended to meet his aides for training sessions, but now everything has to be done via Skype. Movement in Wenzhou is restricted, and even if Ding just wants to go out into the street he has to inform the manager of the building and have his temperature taken.\nNearer the tournament, which starts on 15 March, there could yet be visa problems for both Ding and Wang, while their inward flights from China are only permitted to arrive at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport, 900 miles west of Ekaterinburg in the Urals.\nChina\u2019s No3, Wei Yi, has also been affected and has just withdrawn from the Prague Masters starting in 12 February where he was the No2 seed. He is not ill, but \u201cthe sudden coronavirus happened in China, and as the situation became worse and worse, it was impossible to make this journey\u201d.

The BHA will be supporting the IHRB in monitoring of betting on Irish racing and we will also be co-operating in other areas of intelligence.\u201d\nThe BHA has no history of taking on such contract work for other regulators but its spokesman, Robin Mounsey, said that the benefits of closer co-operation with Irish officials were too good to pass up. \u201cThe improved collaboration that this agreement will bring will benefit those who work in, bet on and follow racing on both sides of the Irish Sea,\u201d he said.\n\u201cUsing a single intelligence management and monitoring system, as well as recruiting a dedicated resource to monitor the majority of Irish racing from a betting perspective will further protect the integrity of both British and Irish racing and allow the relationship that exists between the BHA and IHRB to grow closer still.\u201d\nWhile the degree of proposed collaboration is new, the two regulators have had a good working relationship for years. IHRB vets have assisted the BHA in the build-up to major racing festivals by carrying out tests on some intended runners based in Ireland. Dr Lynn Hillyer, head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer at the IHRB, joined straight from a nine-year stretch at the BHA. \nWillie Mullins will be without Saldier, Klassical Dream and Douvan at the Cheltenham Festival in March.\nDouvan had not been seen since November and the news that the Champion Chase hopeful was not going to line up was not a surprise but the announcement that both Saldier and Kalssical Dream will miss the Champion Hurdle will be felt keenly at the Irish trainer\u2019s yard. The pair\u2019s absence raises the possibility of Benie Des Dieux being supplemented for the race, as was intimated by her owner Rich Ricci last week.\nMullins told the Racing Post: \u201cI have to report that both Klassical Dream and Saldier are out of the Unibet Champion Hurdle picture and won\u2019t be going to the Festival.\n\u201cWe had to withdraw Klassical Dream from the PCI Irish Champion Hurdle last weekend, but the leg infection he picked up and which looked a minor problem on Friday night has turned out to be a bit more serious and we\u2019ve decided to leave him alone. Unfortunately, he\u2019s going to miss the rest of the season.\n\u201cSaldier hasn\u2019t progressed well enough since the setback he had after winning the Morgiana Hurdle in November and he won\u2019t make the Festival. We\u2019ll just have to see how things go and, hopefully, he might make it back for Punchestown.\n\u201cDouvan started the season so well when winning the Clonmel Oil Chase in good style in November on his return from a lengthy absence, but he hasn\u2019t run since and we\u2019re just not happy with him. Whether he\u2019ll be right to go to Punchestown remains to be seen.\u201d\n should go well at around 6-1 on the Bangor card, while \nis worth an interest at decent odds to return to form at Chelmsford City this evening. Dean Ivory\u2019s mare is generally consistent and only 2lb higher than for her latest win over course and distance. \n, meanwhile, will take all the beating in the finale having returned to form in convincing fashion on his first start for Mick Appleby last time. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour", "title": "Lisa Ashton: \u2018I don\u2019t want special treatment as the first woman on the men\u2019s darts tour\u2019", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:53:36 GMT", "summary": "Four-time women\u2019s world champion qualified for the PDC tour by a tiny margin and she celebrated with tea and a takeaway<p>The Barnsley Metrodome is not exactly the first place you think of when it comes to the twists and turns of women\u2019s sport.

But as she explains: \u201cI don\u2019t want any special treatment. I don\u2019t want to be thought of as Lisa Ashton, the first woman to play on the men\u2019s tour. No thank you.\n\u201cI want to be Lisa Ashton, the dart player. If someone beats me, fair enough. Whether I\u2019m a man or a woman shouldn\u2019t come into it.\u201d\nShe has played against men in exhibitions for years and is honest enough to admit there is still some resentment towards ladies darts in dwindling corners of the sport.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a fair few male players who I think feel the pressure because they don\u2019t want to lose to a woman \u2013 hopefully that helps me out this year,\u201d she laughs.\nAshton will be a full-time professional on the PDC for at least the next two years, opening the door to previously unimaginable riches. There is more than \u00a314m available each year on the PDC tour: a far cry from the recent edition of the BDO World Championship, when Ashton earned only \u00a34,500 as the runner-up.\nSherrock has emerged as the face of women\u2019s darts thanks to her run at Alexandra Palace but that does not seem to bother Ashton, who has been the standard-bearer in the BDO for years and has been ready to test herself against the men for a while. \u201cI missed out by a point at Q School last year but this time I came back with the serious intention of getting a card,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the ladies game snowball in recent years and knew this was the next step, one of us getting a card. Fallon has made the headlines, and wasn\u2019t she brilliant at Ally Pally? But below her, myself and Mikuru [Suzuki, the reigning women\u2019s world champion], there\u2019s so many names coming through. I think it\u2019s just the start. Barry Hearn said if the women were good enough, they\u2019d get opportunities. We\u2019ve proven that can happen.\u201d\nAshton gained her tour card at Q School on legs difference, after a seven-hour wait on the final day to learn her fate. She was one or two legs away from missing out on her dream of becoming a PDC professional. \u201cI was so emotionally exhausted, I celebrated by going home, making a brew and ordering a takeaway,\u201d she smiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sunk in. It probably won\u2019t until I get there on Saturday and see Michael van Gerwen, Gerwyn Price and the rest of them and think: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m playing these guys every week now.\u2019\u201d Her tour card gives her the opportunity to play at the biggest events, including the UK Open in March, which Sherrock has herself reached via a local qualifying event.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could play each other in a PDC event on TV,\u201d Ashton says. \u201cIt\u2019d be great because one of us is definitely through, but hopefully that isn\u2019t until the latter rounds.\u201d A return to Alexandra Palace at the end of this year is also high on the agenda \u2013 but for now, Ashton is simply keen to enjoy the moment in Barnsley this weekend and settle into her new life as a professional.\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing we can play darts now,\u201d she insists. \u201cFor years, people thought women playing darts was a bit of a novelty but now people can see we\u2019re good enough. To break that glass ceiling, inspire a few more ladies to take the game seriously and believe they can play with the men would be on a par with anything I\u2019ve done in the game. It\u2019s pressure, but good pressure.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/wales-dillon-lewis-full-of-beans-successful-six-nations": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/wales-dillon-lewis-full-of-beans-successful-six-nations", "title": "Wales\u2019 Dillon Lewis full of beans for another successful Six Nations | Paul Rees", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:08:06 GMT", "summary": "The prop, who has a coffee business, has taken his chances over the past three years and is now first choice for his country<p>When Dillon Lewis feels that rugby has become too much of a grind, the Wales prop will be able to fall back on the coffee-bean business he set up two years ago with his Cardiff Blues front-row colleague Brad Thyer.

To the 24-year-old, reference to the black stuff means an Americano rather than a pint of stout, the tipple of preference of many of his tight-head predecessors at the Arms Park.\n\u201cCoffee is the alternative to beer for a professional player,\u201d says Lewis, one of a number of players who was capped by Warren Gatland before he had established himself at his region.\n\u201cRugby is a social sport and players get on with each other and if you cannot go to a pub, where do you go? We have a coffee club at the Blues but I have become a bit of a snob unfortunately. When I moved house, the first thing I bought was a great big coffee machine and I have up to seven cups a day, starting at 5.30 in the morning.\u201d\nLewis is one of the lesser-known players in Wales\u2019s team but he will be winning his 25th cap on Saturday. He admits his entry into international rugby was a happy accident, but one he fully exploited. Injury had reduced him to one appearance for the Blues in 2016-17 and as he worked his way back at club level he was summoned to train with Wales before their summer tour matches against Tonga and Samoa.\n\u201cThey pulled me in to training to make up the numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cGreg Bateman [the Leicester prop] was going to go on the tour, but in the end he could not prove his eligibility to play for Wales and I ended up on the plane.\n\u201cI was on the bench for Tonga and came on in the last couple of minutes, then Tomas Francis was called up by the Lions. I started against Samoa and returned home with two caps. It was complete chance, but you have to take opportunities when they come.\n\u201cI do not know what Gats saw in me. His regime was tough and you did not have many days off but it worked and the last 18 months under him were unbelievable, a grand slam and a penalty \n.\n\u201cWe are under new management now and you are judged in different ways. Italy showed the\n we aspire to, but the mindset of hard graft has not changed. There is a different outlook on how we want to play, but you cannot be expansive without putting in the hard work first.\u201d\nLewis established himself last season, being used from the bench after the first round of Wales\u2019s grand slam campaign and was involved in all seven matches in the World Cup, replacing the injured Francis 35 minutes into the semi-final against South Africa. He is the epitome of a modern prop, strong in the scrum \u2013 although Wales had problems in that area against Italy last Saturday \u2013 powerful over the ball and comfortable handling, running, passing and tackling.\n\u201cThere may be fewer scrums in the game today, but you will not get picked as a prop if you cannot scrummage,\u201d he says. \u201cEqually, you will be left out if that is all you bring but it is your primary role. I love getting my hands on the ball but the first part of my game that I look at is the scrum. It is still a significant part of the game and England will have wondered how they did not win in Paris having dominated France in that area.\n\u201cWe had some issues in the set piece last weekend but the main problem was that we took too long to work out what the referee was looking for. We had a pretty good scrum in the World Cup and it is an area we always work hard on.\n\u201cI started out as a No 8. I was called into the Blues\u2019 Under-16s a year early and one of the coaches sat me down and said I was not fast enough to make it in that position and would be better off in the front row.\n\u201cMy love for the game stemmed from being constantly involved and I did not want to lose that as a prop. I was 17 when I made my debut for Pontypridd in the Welsh Premiership, chucked in the deep end because of injuries. I played six games in three weeks and learned a lot, finding out why they go on about the dark arts in the front row.\u201d\nLewis set up Fat Dragon with Thyer and welcomes the distraction it provides. \u201cBrad was out for 12 months with injury and came to me with the idea of starting a business,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came up with coffee and sell beans. We get half of them roasted in England and the other half in a unit in Wales. We do everything online, supplying coffee shops and gyms. It is a switch-off button even though you are still working and it is a bit of a retirement plan, even if I hope that is a while away.\n\u201cTokyo was good for coffee shops and so is Dublin, but I doubt I will have the time to visit one. It is always hard at the Aviva Stadium and it is usually raining. We have focused on ourselves this week, tweaking what we did not get right against Italy, and there is no reason why we cannot win.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/xfl-relaunch-season-start-vince-mcmahon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/xfl-relaunch-season-start-vince-mcmahon", "title": "XFL relaunches and attempts to forget the 'sex, booze and sleaze' era", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:00:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>The NFL\u2019s would-be rival kicks off this weekend 19 years after its first incarnation imploded.

The name is the same and the logo is similar but this iteration of the XFL promises to be very different \n.\nThat imploded after a single season in 2001 when TV viewers turned off the clownish antics surrounding the on-field action, amid a barrage of negative publicity. The New York Post claimed that rowdy fans turned a New York/New Jersey Hitmen game into a family-unfriendly carnival of \n.\nThe old XFL was a reminder that anything conceived as \u201csports entertainment\u201d risks being neither, with McMahon\u2019s wrestling connections more liability than asset. This time there will be no jokes about \n and Jesse \u201cThe Body\u201d Ventura will not be the \n.\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun, it was like a football game with a rock concert going on around it, but it wasn\u2019t presented on television as real football,\u201d says Tom Luginbill, who was a coach for the Los Angeles Xtreme \u2013 champions of the original XFL \u2013 and is now part of ESPN\u2019s \n broadcast team.\nLuginbill believes the quality of play was underrated but the XFL tried too hard to set itself apart from the NFL. \u201cMaybe there was never truly a belief that it could stand on its own two legs on football alone,\u201d he said. Now, though, the mantra is authenticity. \u201cFootball and football only,\u201d Luginbill said. \u201cThere\u2019s no gimmicks.\u201d\n should make for faster, higher-scoring contests than in the NFL, while this time the planning was meticulous, according to Kurt Hunzeker, president of one of the new teams, the St Louis BattleHawks. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent so much time listening to fans, testing, retesting focus groups, really fine-tuning elements of a sport that people clearly love,\u201d he says.\nThe basic logic goes like this: football is by far America\u2019s most popular sport, the NFL is the world\u2019s richest league and the Super Bowl typically \n. Yet the season is short and after that finale, fans are forced to go cold turkey until the autumn. Talent, meanwhile, is wasted: with only 32 NFL franchises but \n high-level college teams, there is a deep pool of young players desperate for any opportunity, as well as older NFL discards looking for a route back.\nThat\u2019s the theory. But others have tried and failed, such as the United States Football League of the mid-80s, which imploded after pursuing an \n advocated by one of the team owners, Donald J Trump.\nMost recently, the Alliance of American Football \n last year and seduced Eminem \u2013 \u201callowing the players to actually fight would be key to league\u2019s success like hockey\u201d he \n \u2013 before hitting financial trouble and \nafter eight weeks by a saviour turned executioner.\nThere are two core ways for owners to make money: real-estate deals that increase franchise values and broadcast revenue. But start-up leagues tend to rent existing venues, and though the XFL will be live on ABC, Fox and Fox Sports as well as ESPN, no media company will shell out substantial rights payments until a sport can prove it attracts viewers. And the sport has particular costs: the sheer number of players \u2013 each XFL team has 52-man rosters \u2013 and its inherent injury risk, which means high medical expenses.\nWith XFL players earning \n, that amounts to nearly $3m per season per team in player salaries alone, before other expenses. A 10-week regular season means each team plays only five home games, and with season tickets as low as $100, attendances will not cover all costs.\nThe Alliance was doomed after racking up tens of millions of dollars in losses in only a few weeks, but McMahon is rich enough to ride out a similar scenario for a few seasons. Last year the 74-year-old chairman and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment \n of shares, presumably to fund his new venture.\nDavid Carter, an associate professor at the USC Marshall School of Business and a sports business consultant, thinks the XFL\u2019s capacity to spend more than it makes could be vital. \u201cOver the long haul, labour stability via collective bargaining agreements and valuable media contracts are the keys, and they go together. But in the near term, while those are among the primary considerations, so too is the ability to deficit spend while refining both the on-field product and the league\u2019s marketing,\u201d he says.\nTechnology and the gradual liberalisation of sports betting laws after a 2018 US Supreme Court decision also offer intriguing possibilities. Not for nothing were \n partnering with the AAF, which was developing an innovative mobile app.\nMcMahon has largely kept out of the spotlight so far, letting credible football figures such as XFL commissioner and CEO, Oliver Luck - father of Andrew, the retired Indianapolis Colts quarterback - do the talking. (The XFL did not respond to interview requests.) Teams are based in the Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Dallas, Houston, Washington, St Louis and Tampa markets. This represents one of the XFL\u2019s biggest gambles: that cities with NFL teams have an appetite for more football.\nThe exception is St Louis, where Rams \u2013 and Arsenal \u2013 owner Stan Kroenke outraged Missourians by moving the franchise to LA in 2016. The BattleHawks will play in the Rams\u2019 former home and sold more than 6,000 season tickets by early January, The Athletic \n.\n\u201cI do think it can be a local hit. The fact that we don\u2019t have an NFL team here benefits the BattleHawks,\u201d says Randy Karraker, a sports radio presenter. \u201cThere are a lot of people in St Louis that will not watch the NFL at all because of what Stan Kroenke and the league did to them in ripping the team from St Louis.\u201d\nPaul Voss, co-host of the BattleFan podcast, agrees that the Rams\u2019 acrimonious exit is driving some of the early buzz. \u201cWe have something to prove, that we\u2019re a good sports town, we support our teams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a hometown team to root for again.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/world-athletics-foot-down-nike-running-shoe-regulations": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/world-athletics-foot-down-nike-running-shoe-regulations", "title": "World Athletics denies tipping off Nike over new running-shoe regulations", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 21:30:00 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 US company produced 39.5mm heel days after limit set at 40<br />\u2022 We could look at our regulations again, says WA spokesman<br /><p>World Athletics has insisted it will not let running-shoe technology spiral further out of control despite the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/nike-air-zoom-alphafly-next-shoe\" title=\"\">another \u201cgamechanging\u201d Nike marathon shoe</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>Track and field\u2019s governing body also rejected claims that the US company might have had advanced warning of its new regulations, announced last Friday, after the company\u2019s new Air Zoom Alphafly Next% with a 39.5mm heel slipped just inside the new limit of 40mm.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/world-athletics-foot-down-nike-running-shoe-regulations\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "World Athletics has insisted it will not let running-shoe technology spiral further out of control despite the release of \n on Wednesday.\nTrack and field\u2019s governing body also rejected claims that the US company might have had advanced warning of its new regulations, announced last Friday, after the company\u2019s new Air Zoom Alphafly Next% with a 39.5mm heel slipped just inside the new limit of 40mm.\nA World \n spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe spoke to several shoe companies, including Nike, a few days before we released our new shoe regulations to let them know what we were planning.

Having \n for almost an hour at Wigan last week, they recorded their first victory of the season in a mightily impressive manner.\nGranted the Wolves were facing a Saints side without a host of first-team regulars but, having emerged from a scrappy opening half-hour to lead by three scores at half-time, they killed the prospect of a comeback with Josh Charnley\u2019s try shortly after the restart. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not getting carried away but we kept them to zero and we\u2019ve got to build from that,\u201dPrice said.\nKristian Woolf\u2019s reign as \n coach is only two games old but the circumstances surrounding this, their first league defeat since July, ensure he is facing the kind of crisis that his predecessor did not endure throughout their title-winning campaign last season.\nSaints were already without five of the side who won last year\u2019s Grand Final here when matters were made worse as Alex Walmsley pulled out minutes before kick-off. Mark Percival was injured midway through the game, leaving Woolf desperately short of strike power with the World Club Challenge against Sydney Roosters a fortnight away.\nWoolf, however, was in no mood to hide behind his side\u2019s problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough out there to win games of footy and enough out there to play better than what we did,\u201dhe said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help but those injuries throw up a challenge. Tonight we didn\u2019t take that challenge on. It was disappointing.\u201d\nA penalty from the boot of Stefan Ratchford was the only score of the opening half-hour but Warrington clicked into gear in the minutes before the break. Daryl Clark\u2019s instinctive dummy-half finish made it 6-0,before last-ditch offloading allowed Tom Lineham the opportunity to squeeze over.\nRatchford converted to make it 12-0 before a drop goal from the outstanding Blake Austin opened up a three-score lead. Realistically the visitors had to score first after half-time to stand any chance but without so many frontline players \u2013 the Saints will be checking on a calf injury to Walmsley and a pectoral blow for Percival \u2013it was no surprise that Warrington struck instead.\nAnother fine piece of handling created the space for Josh Charnley to touch down and by the time Ratchford had kicked another penalty attention had already turned to whether the Wolves could nil the Saints, rather than just win the game.\nThere were one or two nervy moments late on but that question was emphatically answered in the final seconds when they scrambled en masse to deny Lomax.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/england-eddie-jones-verbal-abuse-scotland": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/england-eddie-jones-verbal-abuse-scotland", "title": "England\u2019s Eddie Jones says he is subjected to verbal abuse \u2018every day\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:00:50 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 Coach accepts abuse comes with the job as head coach<br>\u2022 England under-prepared before defeat in France, he says</p><p>Eddie Jones has claimed he is subjected to verbal abuse by members of the public on a daily basis and says it comes with the territory of being the England coach.</p><p>Jones returns to Murrayfield on Saturday for the first time since a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/28/eddie-jones-reveals-abuse-england-defeat-scotland\" title=\"\">Scotland fans hurled abuse</a> at him outside a Manchester train station the day after England\u2019s Calcutta Cup defeat in 2018.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/england-eddie-jones-verbal-abuse-scotland\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": " has claimed he is subjected to verbal abuse by members of the public on a daily basis and says it comes with the territory of being the England coach.\nJones returns to Murrayfield on Saturday for the first time since a group of \n at him outside a Manchester train station the day after England\u2019s Calcutta Cup defeat in 2018.\nHe was repeatedly sworn at during the incident, while throughout the match 24 hours earlier he was subjected to taunts from Scotland supporters. He was also vociferously booed during last Sunday\u2019s defeat by France, \nto unleash \u201cabsolute brutality\u201d on England\u2019s opponents.\nTwo years ago Jones had travelled alone from Edinburgh to Manchester to attend a Premier League football match at Old Trafford when he was confronted, prompting him to say he would never use British public transport again. on Thursday Jones confirmed he is flying to and from Edinburgh with the rest of the squad this time.\nDismissing the 2018 incident, which resulted in the three men being fined, as \u201ctiny\u201d, Jones said he comes in for similar treatment every day. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t of any significance at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happens every day. What do you reckon happens when I walk down the street? Some people say nice things, some people are into you. It happens every day. If you didn\u2019t want it, you don\u2019t do this job.\u201d\nOf his travel plans he added: \u201cI am not going to any football games. I am going directly home. I will be coming back with the team.\u201d\nJones is likely to receive a hostile reception at Murrayfield, having described \n who look to goad their opponents. Jones is more concerned with getting England\u2019s Six Nations campaign back on track after the 24-17 defeat by France. The coach believes England can still \u201c100%\u201d win the Six Nations and has pledged to take on Scotland up front after making sweeping changes to his team.\nBen Youngs, Joe Marler and Courtney Lawes have been dropped with Willi Heinz, Mako Vunipola, George Kruis, Lewis Ludlam and Jonathan Joseph coming in. He has also named six forwards on the bench as a show of intent and it is understood he would have made six changes to his starting XV with Luke Cowan-Dickie pencilled in to start until the hooker withdrew on Friday morning after his partner went into labour.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an obvious plan that we want to play against them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not hiding from the fact that we want to take them on up front. We just think it\u2019s going to be a high-volume, high-intensity game in the forwards. I just think our strengths are up front and that\u2019s what we want to play to.\u201d\nJones has blamed his side\u2019s slow start in Paris \u2013 England were 17-0 down at half-time and conceded another seven unanswered points until Jonny May restored respectability with two fine individual tries \u2013 on his decision to ease his players into camp owing to their club workloads following the World Cup. As a result Jones believes England will finish the tournament strongly with consecutive home matches against Ireland and Wales and an away trip to Italy following Saturday\u2019s match.\n\u201cI think I under-prepared the team, so it took us some time to get into the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a reason for that given the workload of the players. We under-prepared and I take full responsibility. But there\u2019s a reason for that and my view is that we\u2019ll see the reason at the end of the competition \u2013 that we\u2019ll be full of running.\u201d To that end the losing bonus point in Paris may prove pivotal. \u201cEvery point is important in a competition when there\u2019s bonus points,\u201d Jones added.\n echoed Jones\u2019s sentiments and expects a significant step-up in performance. \u201cWe\u2019ll believe that [we can win the tournament] until it\u2019s not possible,\u201d the England captain said. \u201cTraining has stepped up this week. We have had a good look at ourselves, we have seen what we can do and we have stepped up. You do tend to have a bit more of a look at yourself after a loss. It allows you to be a bit more open. We have said where we want to improve and I would expect us to not just talk about it but do it.\u201d\nThe \n organisers have confirmed they are in dialogue with the unions and \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d regarding Storm Ciara.

The first choice that year was Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns, a friend of Russell around whom the front office has been trying to rebuild the roster. Minnesota will be Russell\u2019s fourth \n team. He averaged 23.6 points per game for the injury-wrecked Warriors, a career high after coming in an offseason trade with Brooklyn.\nThe Wolves tried to woo him then, too, but Russell instead steered that sign-and-trade swap toward the Warriors, the five-time defending Western Conference champions who\u2019ve won three NBA titles during that span. Russell is playing the first season of a four-year, $117m contract. \nWiggins, the first overall selection in the 2014 draft, never fulfilled his potential with the Wolves, a shooting and slashing wing with the athleticism and frame to dominate on the perimeter. He is averaging 22.4 points this season, an uptick from the past two years but still capped by a pattern of inconsistency. He\u2019s been a defensive liability, too, for a team that has persistently ranked among the easiest to score against in the league. The 6ft 7in Wiggins is in the second season of a five-year, $147m deal.\nThe Timberwolves, who have lost 12 straight games, have bottomed out in their first year under president of basketball operations Gersson Rosas as he attempts to remake the roster for a faster-paced, three-point-heavy offense as directed by rookie coach Ryan Saunders. \nThe Warriors are the only team below the Wolves in the West this season, with stars Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on the mend. The Warriors also struck a lower-profile deal before the deadline, sending Glenn Robinson and Alec Burks to Philadelphia for draft picks.\n-- The Los Angeles Clippers have acquired guard Marcus Morris Sr from the New York Knicks in exchange for forward Maurice Harkless, the Athletic reported. The deal continues to evolve, according to the report, and could include more players and/or draft picks.\nMorris, 30, has averaged a career-best 19.6 points in his ninth NBA season and first with the Knicks. \nThe Clippers entered play Thursday in second place in the Western Conference with a 36-15 record. The Knicks were 13th in the 15-team Eastern Conference with a 15-36 record.\n-- The Cleveland Cavaliers have reportedly agrees to acquire center Andre Drummond in a trade from the Detroit Pistons. \nCleveland, who are just 13-39 this season, are sending forward John Henson, guard Brandon Knight and one of their two second-round picks in 2023 to the Pistons. \nOne of the conference\u2019s best all-around big men, Drummond is averaging 17.8 points and 15.8 rebounds in his eighth season with Detroit. Drummond\u2019s arrival will make the Cavs immediately better, and it may allow them to make more moves, perhaps with forward Kevin Love or center Tristan Thompson, who is eligible for free agency this summer.\n-- Andre Iguodala\u2019s trade to Miami was getting closer to the finish line on Thursday after the Heat and Memphis Grizzlies agreed to terms on a six-player trade, according to sources.\nThe portion of the trade involving Iguodala was agreed on Wednesday night, as was the 2015 NBA Finals MVP agreeing to a two-year extension with Miami that will be formalized when the totality of the deal actually gets approved by the league. \nJustise Winslow knew he was leaving Miami for Memphis on Wednesday night, as evidenced by some social-media posts and a late-night visit to his now-former locker room to pack up his belongings and wish a security guard well. Also in the deal: Dion Waiters and James Johnson leaving Miami for Memphis, with Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill leaving the Grizzlies for the Heat.\nIguodala, speaking to The Undefeated on Wednesday night, said he was eager to play alongside Jimmy Butler and Miami\u2019s young core while helping mentor them as well. \n\u201cJimmy Butler ... he\u2019s looked at as different but is very well-respected in terms of the passion and the hard work that he brings to the game,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cI feel like his temperament and values that he has really resonates with the \n. They\u2019re very well aligned. I think he\u2019s brought out the best in those young guys.\u201d\nIguodala specifically mentioned Heat center Bam Adebayo, a first-time All-Star this year. \u201cBam, I\u2019m really looking forward to playing with him,\u201d Iguodala said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/jofra-archer-ruled-out-of-sri-lanka-tour-and-ipl-cricket": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/jofra-archer-ruled-out-of-sri-lanka-tour-and-ipl-cricket", "title": "Jofra Archer ruled out of Sri Lanka tour and IPL after fresh injury setback", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:04:39 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Scans confirm a stress fracture in Archer\u2019s right elbow</li><li>Bowler will target a return for June series against West Indies</li></ul><p>Jofra Archer has been ruled out of England\u2019s tour to Sri Lanka next month after scans revealed a low-grade stress fracture to his elbow.

Archer is also likely to miss his stint in the Indian Premier League.\nThe diagnosis comes after more sophisticated examination on his return to the UK. The ECB has suggested a likely three-month absence to remedy an injury first sustained in last summer\u2019s World Cup. At that stage Archer took painkillers and played on through England\u2019s winning run.\nHe then toured New Zealand with England in November, where a stiff workload on unresponsive pitches raised some concerns. A stress injury to the elbow was confirmed after the first Test against South Africa at Centurion last month, although subsequent efforts were made to select him in that series. Archer was seen leaving the field close to tears after \n on the morning of the fourth Test in Johannesburg.\nWith the swelling around the elbow now reduced, doctors in London were able to inject dye into the joint, detecting a low-grade fracture. As a centrally contracted player, Archer\u2019s rehabilitation will now be overseen by the ECB. Another scan is planned in four weeks, with the hope of a return to international cricket in June for the three-match West Indies Test series.\nFollowing England\u2019s announcement Archer\u2019s IPL franchise, the Rajasthan Royals, tweeted that they have been \u201cworking with the ECB to help Jofra Archer secure a speedy recovery, and still hope to see him in a Royals jersey this season\u201d. The Royals have seen Archer\u2019s scans and been kept informed about his progress but the prognosis from England remains more bleak, with a conviction Archer is certain to miss the IPL this season.\nThe severity of the injury will reignite concerns over the level and nature of Archer\u2019s workload with England. The bare statistics look troubling. Archer bowled more overs in all formats than any other England bowler in 2019, despite making his debut in May and despite carrying an injury for most of that time.\nOnly four international cricketers around the world bowled more overs in the calendar year, and only two pace bowlers. Pat Cummins bowled 607.3 to Archer\u2019s 400.5, although Cummins is also a cautionary tale, having spent years remodelling his action and strengthening his body to reach his current state of effectiveness.\nQuestions will now be asked about how the ECB intends to manage Archer from here. There are no immediate plans to do anything differently beyond rest, rehabilitation and hoping Archer will adapt to the gruelling demands of full-time centrally contacted fast bowling. Test series notwithstanding, the most pressing task at this stage will be to reintegrate England\u2019s best white ball bowler, fully fit and recharged, for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October.\nThe news comes as England prepare to play South Africa in Durban in the second one-day international. The weather forecast for Friday\u2019s game is gloomy, with rain expected on and off all day. Either side of any weather breaks England will be eager to raise their game several levels from the disappointingly \n.\nTom Curran, who will expect to keep his spot, was quick to point out that England have lost matches before and gone on to win the series. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive confidence knock, the boys are going to be training hard ready to try and level the series tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nAsked about Archer\u2019s elbow, and the high frequency of fast-bowling injuries, Curran was equally phlegmatic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a broad conversation, you\u2019ll have to speak to the scientists behind it. He\u2019s obviously bowled quite a lot recently so if that\u2019s had an influence on it I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s been a lot of fast bowlers who go through phases of getting injured and not getting injured, it\u2019s just part of being a fast bowler.\u201d\nUnfortunately for England and Archer this does seem to be the case right now, with Mark Wood and Jimmy Anderson also struggling with recurrent injuries. England are expected to field an unchanged team for what may well be a shortened day/night game.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics", "title": "Edwin Moses: \u2018We all knew doping was happening ... it was a dark period in athletics\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 13:06:42 GMT", "summary": "The two-time Olympic 400m hurdles champion on his fight against doping, his amazing unbeaten streak and meeting Nelson Mandela<p>The number 999 is burned into Edwin Moses\u2019s psyche.

It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport.\nMoses has helped lead the clampdown on \n. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, even as \u201cauthorised neutrals\u201d, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition need to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its individual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I worked out three times a day,\u201d he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. \u201cI ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.\u201d\nThis was not the template used by cheating athletes. \u201cWe all knew it was happening,\u201d Moses says. \u201cWe knew doping was wide scale because there was no drug testing \u2013 beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated.\n\u201cI\u2019m a physicist. I\u2019ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the eastern bloc women. They were much more manly than me.\n\u201cThen, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world.\n\u201cA few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it\u2019s continued for a long time. It\u2019s finally changing now but I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don\u2019t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That\u2019s why we have out-of-competition drug testing \u2013 because of what I and a few others did in 1988.\u201d\nAthletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in \n, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport.\n\u201c\n, I put together a group of 10 US athletes. We demanded [out-of-competition] testing in the US. We got the money and legislation and drew up the drug programme from scratch because no one had ever done it. We got it ratified and the following year the US Olympic Committee adopted our programme. I became the chief of US testing from 1989 to 1994.\n\u201cThere was no such thing as Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] and, in the US, I was chairman of the committee for the big six Olympic sports. I negotiated agreements to test athletes and that was the first testing outside competition.\u201d\nThe 64-year-old Moses seems energised by World Athletics. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an outstanding battle in the fight against doping and hopefully the corrupt people are gone. \n. World Athletics put out a statement saying unless the Russians apologise for the last transgression [when their federation conspired to hide the truth with the 2018 world indoor high jump champion, Danil Lysenko, who missed three doping tests], they\u2019re rescinding the possibility of their athletes competing in Tokyo. Period. They\u2019ll stop all of them.\u201d\nAt the world championships in Doha last October, 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia won six medals \u2013 despite their country being banned for four years. \u201cThe ones they allowed to compete [in Doha] were tested as much as anyone else. If they can\u2019t show the same evidence there\u2019s no reason to let them compete. I feel that way about any athlete from the many areas of the world where there\u2019s very little testing. But this latest news is significant. Someone\u2019s got to stand up for the right thing.\u201d\nDoes he expect Russia to back down and apologise? \u201cNo. I doubt it.\u201d\nMoses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada \u2013 as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the International Olympic Committee. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada\u2019s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. \n in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to \u201cshut up\u201d by some Wada officials.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that \u2013 alongside Beckie and others on the athletes\u2019 commission \u2013 we forced Wada to look at its governance,\u201d Moses says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ve been able to \n. Changes were made to bring an ethical balance to the way Wada is run internally. The Russians got caught red-handed and the evidence was clear from two investigations.\n\u201cBut politically it was perceived differently because of the money Russia puts into sports. If it had been a completely independent group that had nothing to do with international federations or the IOC, it would not have dragged on. At Wada they had federation guys and IOC guys who were not looking out for the best [anti-doping] interests. That was the innate problem. We forced them to deal with those issues.\u201d\nWill Wada be stronger now? \u201cWe will see. The new president at Wada, Witold Banka, is a [former Poland] athlete. I think the strain in anti-doping politics has been taken out because the leadership has changed. That was the elephant in the room. It started at the top [with the former president Craig Reedie being associated with the IOC].\u201d\nIs the war against doping being won? \u201cOur deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we\u2019re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They\u2019re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we\u2019re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That\u2019s brought in a whole new way of testing.\u201d\nMoses is also a passionate ambassador for \n \u2013 the group that celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people. He cites the moment when he \n at the inaugural Laureus awards in 2000 as \u201cone of the big moments of my life. What he said that night, about the power of sport, was so pertinent. I saw people crying in the audience. From then on I applied all the hard work, the discipline, the winning \u2013 all the positive things I learned from sport \u2013 to Laureus and helped build a great organisation. It\u2019s been as satisfying as sport itself.\u201d\nStressing the wider social and political power of sport, Moses encourages athletes to protest openly against racism, homophobia and other forms of injustice. He talks knowledgeably about football\u2019s enduring problems with racism and supports those England players who have \n the next time they are subjected to racial abuse. \u201cI would agree with them. If that\u2019s what it takes, that\u2019s a small price to pay for the indignity human beings suffer. I would have walked off the track if I had seen something like that.\u201d\nMoses also backs \n against police brutality and racism in the US. In contrast, when asked about Donald Trump, Moses says: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about our president.\u201d\nThe IOC has said it will ban \n but Moses rejects this aim. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can stop it. It\u2019s an individual discretionary endeavour and history shows you can\u2019t stop protest.\u201d\nSporting history confirms that, for those nine years, nine months and nine days, Moses was also unstoppable. Before he races off to his next meeting in Atlanta I ask him about the astonishing streak that began after he lost a race in Berlin against the German 400m hurdler Harald Schmid. A week later in D\u00fcsseldorf, Moses beat Schmid by 15 metres. Did the pain of defeat drive him for the next decade?\n\u201cThat was a funny day. Before the race I\u2019m sitting at the pool when I should\u2019ve been working out at the track. But I was winning the race until I made a mistake at the last hurdle because I was running so slow. I used 14 steps instead of 13. That\u2019s why I lost. But it taught me a lesson. You have to be 100% ready all the time. Don\u2019t take anything for granted. After that I did not have any problems for almost 10 years.\u201d\nWas it particularly painful when he finally lost a race, to Danny Harris? \u201cNo. When I first started I lost all the time. Losing is part of the game. If you lose you figure out what you did wrong and fix it up. If it had been another five metres, I would probably have caught him. I\u2019d been suffering from food poisoning and nearly pulled out but I was paid my money and I ran.\u201d\nA few months later, Moses beat Harris to gold at the world championships. \u201cI was happy and the fact I had lost to him was beside the point. Most people lose.\u201d\nMoses almost always won but is there a danger his remarkable sporting record may be forgotten? \u201cNo. Just last week Tiger Woods said he believed \n. As time goes on, it becomes more meaningful and significant. It\u2019s been 33 years since I quit. No one\u2019s even come close to my record. And it\u2019s doubtful anyone will.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/george-best-manchester-united-six-goals-northampton-fa-cup-1970": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/george-best-manchester-united-six-goals-northampton-fa-cup-1970", "title": "Six of the Best: when George ran riot for Manchester United 50 years ago", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 14:32:45 GMT", "summary": "On 7 February 1970 George Best got six goals at Northampton in the FA Cup in his push to prove the \u2018cranks\u2019 wrong<p>The meticulousness with which even the lowliest football clubs prepare for matches these days makes Northampton\u2019s meeting the day before their FA Cup fifth-round game against Manchester United 50 years ago seem endearingly quaint.

Hopeful of an upset, they settled down to be briefed by the club\u2019s scouting department, an elderly local gentleman who had gone to watch United\u2019s most recent match.\nFacing players of the calibre of Paddy Crerand, Bobby Charlton and Brian Kidd the prognosis was bleak, he told them, but if they could \u201cnobble\u201d Charlton they might have a chance. Sadly, Northampton\u2019s reconnaissance man failed to mention that a 23-year-old by the name of \n would probably be lining up against them, as the Ballon d\u2019Or and European Cup winner had been serving a month-long ban when the scouting mission was carried out. It would prove, with the benefit of hindsight, quite the oversight.\nSome weeks previously, Best had incurred the wrath of the Football Association for kicking the ball out of referee Jack Taylor\u2019s hands at the end of a League Cup match against Manchester City and been suspended for a month. It was a punishment the mercurial midfielder deemed excessive and attributed to the FA\u2019s disapproval of his playboy lifestyle. He was further peeved by mutterings that during a subsequent five-match unbeaten streak, Manchester United were much improved in his absence.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been suspended I\u2019ve had letters from cranks saying that the team played better without me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt if we were beaten by \n, people would say it was my fault.\u201d\nDespite struggling against their lowly rivals for the first 20 minutes of the game played on 7 February 1970, United ran out 8-2 winners. Best, on a mission to prove his detractors wrong, chipped in with the winning margin of six goals. \u201cI don\u2019t really class myself as a footballer,\u201d he said in the aftermath of the game. \u201cI call myself an entertainer. I know a lot of people have paid to see me do something spectacular and that\u2019s what I was trying to do on Saturday. It\u2019s my job to do something that will send people away feeling that they\u2019d like to see me play again.\u201d\nAnd how. Putting his heroics into context in the following Monday\u2019s Guardian, Albert Barham revealed that Best was the fourth player to score six in an \n match. His double hat-trick wasn\u2019t even a record, he noted, as Bill Minter had scored seven for St Albans against Dulwich Hamlet in the fourth qualifying round in 1922 \u2013 and still finished on the losing side. A little under two years later, Ted MacDougall would eclipse these feats by scoring nine for Bournemouth in an 11-0 first-round win over Margate.\nIn the Observer the day after United\u2019s win\nJohn Heilpern had been effusive in his praise for Best. \u201cHis unique contribution made the suggestion that United play better without him look simply insane,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo have seen Best score those six goals is to have seen genius.\u201d\nA capacity crowd of 21,711 was wedged into Northampton\u2019s three-sided stadium, but few had a better view of their team\u2019s main tormentor than Kim Book, the Northampton goalkeeper. \u201cI have to hold my hand up for two of the goals but the rest were brilliant,\u201d he later conceded. \u201cWhen the fourth went in I thought we might just have our backs to the wall. They were a tremendous side. We all felt it was just an honour to be on the same park.\u201d Book, the brother of Manchester City\u2019s captain, Tony, had received a pre-match call from his sibling. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got anyone who can take care of George, you might have a bit of a problem,\u201d he was advised.\nOn match day, the sun was out but the County Ground was a quagmire, with the pitch markings practically indiscernible and barely a blade of grass to be seen. Best, unfazed by the uneven terrain on which he was forced to work his magic, at times seemed to glide above it as he set about almost single-handedly dismantling the Cobblers.\nHis opener was a gift, Book letting a Kidd cross from the right sail over his outstretched arms and leaving United\u2019s No 7 with a straightforward back-post header towards the Hotel End. Latching on to a through ball from Crerand, the faintest of touches took him past Book before he fired a low diagonal shot into the corner for his second. Kidd, who scored United\u2019s other two goals, turned provider again for goal number three, with Book weakly palming his cross into the path of Best, who roofed it at the second attempt despite the best efforts of three defenders attempting to block its path from six yards. No longer bothering to celebrate, he converted another Kidd cross after getting in front of his man to skim a deft near-post header home for his fourth.\nNorthampton, 5-0 down after Kidd added to United\u2019s tally by stabbing home from a corner, decided to implement their original gameplan by nobbling Charlton, who was forced off with an injury and replaced by Francis Burns. Joining his muddied colleagues, the substitute cut a decidedly incongruous figure in his pristine red and white kit as, with his first touch, he sent Best haring through the middle past two defenders before slotting his fifth and United\u2019s sixth past the increasingly forlorn Book.\nAn exchange of goals \u2013 Kidd\u2019s second and a consolation for Northampton\u2019s Dixie McNeill \u2013 preceded the pick of Best\u2019s half-dozen. Collecting a pass from Crerand on the edge of the penalty area, he ghosted past a defender with a little feint and left Book on his backside gazing in admiration as he spanked home his sixth from a couple of yards. Exhausted, he leaned against the adjacent upright for support as the home crowd acknowledged his genius.\n\u201cI remember thinking George was going to go one way but he dropped his shoulder and went the other and by then I was already on the deck,\u201d Book recalled. \u201cHe was just too good for me.\u201d A subsequent Frank Large header doubled Northampton\u2019s tally.\nNorthampton\u2019s chairman, a local pharmacist by the name of Eric Northover, was not as magnanimous as his players or the home crowd. \u201cIt was disgraceful,\u201d he fumed. \u201cTo lose 8-2 on your own ground is unforgivable. Six of the Best? I would call them six of the easiest.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of a performance that would earn Best an invitation to 10 Downing Street from the prime minister, Harold Wilson, Best and Crerand adjourned to the Northampton dressing room to commiserate with their traumatised opponents. \u201cThey sat down with us and George said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, mate. There wasn\u2019t much you could do.\u2019 He was a gentleman,\u201d Book recalled. Floating above a Northampton bog on a February afternoon a half-century ago, there was little or nothing George Best could not do.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/w-series-spreads-wings-second-season-motorsport-eight-races": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/w-series-spreads-wings-second-season-motorsport-eight-races", "title": "W Series motor racing spreads its wings after outstanding debut season | Giles Richards", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:47:47 GMT", "summary": "All-female series has already had a global impact, with the 2020 calendar expanded from six to eight races and 12 of the 18 drivers already announced coming from different countries<p>When the all-female W Series was announced in 2018 no one expected it to be smooth sailing.

Making waves in motorsport\u2019s boys\u2019 club was always rather the point. Yet few imagined the impact it would make. Going global in only its second season is remarkable.\nThis week the series was awarded the John Nicol Trophy at the British Racing and Sports Car Club awards, honouring the organisation considered to have made the most influential contribution to furthering motorsport. It joins the awards the series has already been given from the UK Guild of Motoring Writers for its services to motoring, and the Autosport Pioneering and Innovation award.\nQuite a haul after only one season. In its inaugural year the W Series consisted of six races, all taking place at meetings of the German Touring Car (DTM) championship in Europe, with 20 drivers competing. Britain\u2019s Jamie Chadwick took the title at the final race at Brands Hatch in August. At the opener in Hockenheim the number of females making their way to the W series paddock was notable. By Brands there was a huge swathe thronging the cars and drivers. That the series had been successful was impossible to ignore.\nCriticised as unnecessary segregation by some, the series has almost completely silenced its detractors. Last week the \nto the top eight drivers this season. The championship winner will receive 15. To be able to race in F1, 40 are required. It was a major validation of the championship and a huge step for W Series, whose aim is ultimately to help a woman driver reach F1.\nShortly before the FIA confirmed the points, the series announced that its 2020 calendar will consist of eight races. Six with DTM but, significantly, the final two to be held at the F1 meetings in the US and Mexico. From having a handful of women drivers competing at senior level worldwide three years ago to a 20-woman grid at an F1 race is extraordinary.\nLast year drivers such as Britain\u2019s Alice Powell, Fabienne Wohlwend of Liechtenstein and the American Sabr\u00e9 Cook acknowledged that it had revitalised careers halted though lack of cash. Not only will all three compete again in the W series in 2020 but they have all also secured drives in other championships this year.\u201d\nCook, who is 25 and from Colorado, was unequivocal. \u201cWhen W Series came along it was all or nothing for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved my driving career and has been a key thing in my life.\u201d\nCrucially she recognises the drivers are all part of a bigger picture, that of inspiring the next generation. \u201cI know a lot of young girls who are trying to figure out how to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the same way, there is not a direct path. W Series coming into the US and more young girls in the States seeing that it is viable will be huge, it will give them something to aim for.\u201d\nThe force behind the series is its chief executive, Catherine Bond Muir. There was a simple premise behind the plans she began making in 2016. \u201cI researched women in motorsports and I was taken aback at how few there had been. It seemed to be something that was so iniquitous and frankly such an obvious wrong that it needed to be corrected.\u201d\nThe series\u2019s success has not happened in a vacuum. Women\u2019s football, rugby and cricket have seen exponential increases in popularity in the past decade, attracting a young audience not bound to the tired shackles of preconception. Those sports have generated a momentum that now seems inexorable.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s perception of women\u2019s sport has changed significantly in the last three years,\u201d Bond Muir added. \u201cThe first evidence was the women\u2019s World Cup, when people were talking about watching \u2018the football\u2019 not \u2018the women\u2019s football\u2019. I feel people are like that with W Series, that it has cracking racing and is entertaining, but that we are not solely defined by being a women\u2019s series.\u201d\nCook is eagerly anticipating her home race at the Circuit of the Americas, and the increase in races also reflects the international feel of the W Series. This season 18 of the 20 drivers have already been selected. They represent 12 nationalities, a range both healthy and vital in providing inspiration across the globe. Without W Series covering all the costs it is impossible to imagine such a range having such a platform.\nThere is a long way to go but as attention turns to F1 car launches next week, in the background the W Series will continue building towards making a difference and ensuring it makes its mark in the US and Mexico.\n\u201cIt is about promoting women to fulfil their potential and show the world what they are capable off,\u201d Bond Muir said. \u201cIf we can help women around the world achieve that, well, I don\u2019t want to appear arrogant but I think we can have an impact right across the world.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/wales-2009-terrestrial-tv-six-nations-cvc-rugby-union": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/wales-2009-terrestrial-tv-six-nations-cvc-rugby-union", "title": "The Breakdown | Were Wales right in 2009 \u2013 will terrestrial TV 'decimate' Six Nations?", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 10:05:36 GMT", "summary": "<p>Desperation to keep games off pay-TV is holding up \u00a3300m CVC deal and there is a danger rugby union could be left behind</p><p>When an advisory panel reviewed in 2009 the list of sporting events that had to be broadcast on terrestrial television, the Welsh Assembly submitted a proposal that the Group A list, made up of matches or tournaments that could not be sold to pay TV for live coverage, should include Wales\u2019s home matches in the Six Nations.</p><p>It argued that as the television audience for those games amounted to 65% of the population, the national interest demanded that they be kept free for all.

The panel agreed and amended the Group A list accordingly in their report for the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, but before a decision was made, there was a change of government and nothing happened.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union had argued that the matches should remain on the Group B list. Events could be screened live on a subscription channel so long as a terrestrial broadcaster was given secondary rights, as happens with England\u2019s home cricket series. It was in no hurry for the Six Nations to do a deal with Sky but argued that if the tournament were restricted to the \n or ITV, the value of the contract would depreciate. Sky was a valuable bargaining tool.\nIt is as well for the Six Nations today that Wales\u2019s home matches are not protected since negotiations continue with CVC, the private equity company seeking a 15% stake in the tournament for \u00a3300m and in return control of its commercial arm. That would give CVC licence to negotiate the broadcasting deal that starts in 2022. The BBC and ITV currently pay \u00a390m a year for the rights and given the problems both broadcasters face, are unlikely to be able to afford more than an incremental increase.\nThat would hardly suit CVC which, in its successful pitches for a 27% stake in both the Premiership and the Pro14, argued that rugby union had undersold itself, particularly when it came to broadcasting rights.\nThe value it places on international rugby can be measured by the fact it invested \u00a3320m in the two leagues for an effective 54% and has offered \u00a320m less for 15% of the Six Nations, although the package would include the rights for the autumn internationals in all the unions.\nThe investment would make sense only were there to be a pay-TV element in the next broadcasting contract, even if the southern hemisphere unions agreed to the July and November tour matches being given a competitive makeover on the lines of World Rugby\u2019s proposed \n last year, albeit without relegation.\nThe danger for CVC now is that a deal taking live matches off free-to-air would spark public outrage and probably a petition to the government for the tournament to be promoted to the A list \u2013 depressing its broadcast value.\nThe Six Nations are so determined to keep a terrestrial element that they are \n, wanting to have the final say. While it is in all their interests to secure a lucrative deal given they would be handing over 15% of their profits each year in return for the lump sum, they are also conscious of the impact on the game\u2019s profile should the Six Nations, along with the November internationals, be taken off free-to-view channels.\nWhen that 2009 panel met, it was presented with figures showing a stark difference between the audiences generated by Sky, then the major subscription service in sport, compared with the BBC and ITV. The first leg of a \n had a viewing figure of 1.77m on Sky compared with 7.48m on ITV for \n. There was a similar 4-1 split for the 2005 and 2009 Ashes series on Channel 4 and Sky respectively.\nSky defended itself by saying that fans watching in pubs and bars were not included in the figures, although the panel concluded the number was insignificant with most viewers preferring to watch big matches at home. But there was no comeback for the figures showing the number of young viewers: a mere 31,000 children aged between four and 15 watched the 2009 Ashes \u2013 on Sky \u2013 compared with two million when \n at football\u2019s 2006 World Cup finals \u2013 on the BBC and ITV.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union submitted in 2009 that a Group A listing would \u201cdecimate the sport\u201d in Wales and threaten its investment in the game. Meanwhile the Six Nations provided written evidence that concluded: \u201cThe Championship may be competed for by the national representative teams of the six participating rugby unions but it is NOT a public asset, owned by \u2018the nation\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cThe technology and power of broadcasting means a sport cannot stand still,\u201d says Richard Cramer, the managing partner of Front Row Legal, which specialises in sports, media and business. \u201cChange is going to happen anyway and a question the Six Nations will be asking themselves is whether they have the expertise to manage it.\n\u201cCVC does and it will have its eyes on overseas markets. If the Six Nations are satisfied that selling a stake to an outside partner will lead to increased revenues, it is a good reason to do it, although a hybrid television deal looks the most likely outcome.\u201d\n \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/west-ham-gilly-flaherty-interview": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/west-ham-gilly-flaherty-interview", "title": "West Ham\u2019s Gilly Flaherty: \u2018People will be shocked because I\u2019m always happy\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:59:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Club captain speaks publicly for the first time about the attempt to take her own life aged 17 and why it\u2019s important to talk</p><p>\u201cIt was the unknown,\u201d says West Ham\u2019s Gilly Flaherty. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen when I went to hospital.

The day before they had sent out a tweet saying: \u2018These letters are the hardest letters to write.\u2019 Then they passed away. And I thought: \u2018I have to do this.\u2019\u201d\nFlaherty\u2019s career is packed with trophies. Seven FA Cups, eight top\u2011division titles, a Champions League win as a part of Arsenal\u2019s quadruple winners; few have had such success. \u201cI think I could have gone through my whole career not having mentioned what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d the 28-year-old captain reflects. \u201cI\u2019m a different person now to the person I was back then \u2013 I\u2019m stronger now. But what\u2019s the point in going through stuff if I don\u2019t think I can benefit someone from it?\n\u201cPeople will probably be shocked. They won\u2019t be expecting it from me because I\u2019m such a bubbly person and I\u2019m always happy. And I am now, but back then I wasn\u2019t and there\u2019s a reason why I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt was moving away from home, from Millwall\u2019s youth teams, and going to Arsenal\u2019s academy, that started the spiral. Flaherty is fiercely sensitive and close to her family. She struggled to cope with being separated from them, and with the death of her grandmother and great aunt. At the same time she was struggling with her sexuality.\n\u201cI say to my mum now that I wish I\u2019d never gone. That\u2019s nothing against Arsenal but I just wish now that I would have stayed at home, gone to college and learned a trade and come out with something.\n\u201cI was in the academy Monday to Friday. Now my mum will have a go at me when I don\u2019t pick up the phone and ring her. Families have WhatsApp groups but when I was younger, I\u2019d go Monday through Friday and I wouldn\u2019t talk to them all week. I wasn\u2019t doing well in college, I wasn\u2019t interested. I was going through things \u2026 I knew I was gay. I had known I was gay for a long time but as you get older you start to think about relationships, you\u2019re talking about taking things a bit further than just liking someone or thinking someone\u2019s nice looking.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all of the unknown. OK, I\u2019m gay but what do I do? Do I go to gay bars? There\u2019s no education about it when you\u2019re younger. How do I find gay girls? Where do I find a partner? I did think when I was growing up that I would be this silly old woman with 100 dogs. And you worry about how your parents will react. You don\u2019t want to disappoint them.\u201d\nThen there was the football. \u201cI was with Arsenal\u2019s first team but I wasn\u2019t playing. I was on the bench. With the team they had it was no surprise but I don\u2019t think I handled that well and I don\u2019t really think I had the right guidance as a younger player.\u201d\nShe was cripplingly lonely. That was the context, the cocktail of emotions, that fuelled the attempt to take her own life aged 17. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d been educated about it. Read something. Or had someone grab hold of me. It\u2019s hard because some people have no one.\u201d\nThere was a heavy helping of luck involved in her survival. It was lucky the lock on her door was broken, enabling her housemate to find her and get her to hospital, where she was put on a drip. \u201cJayne Ludlow and Ciara Grant, Arsenal players at the time, worked in the academy and were sort of the on-call leaders. They came to the hospital and I remember saying to Jayne: \u2018Please don\u2019t call my mum or dad, I don\u2019t want them to know.\u2019 And she was like: \u2018Gilly, how can I not call your mum and dad? We have to tell them.\u2019\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be told off for doing it. I don\u2019t want people to judge me now on that because I\u2019m a completely different person to the person I was then. My mum said to me the other night: \u2018I really worry when you go quiet. Whether it be on social media or the WhatsApp group. Because then I wonder.\u2019 And I said that I would never ever do it again; it would never even come into my mind to do it.\n\u201cBack then I didn\u2019t talk to anyone but I also didn\u2019t think about anyone else. I didn\u2019t think about my mum and dad, I didn\u2019t think about my family. Whereas now there\u2019s no way I would even consider leaving those people behind.\u201d\nProviding help and support is key. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people out there you can talk to but something is stopping people from actually doing it. That\u2019s what is hard. With suicide there\u2019s no second chances. If it\u2019s debt problems, gambling, addiction, struggling with your sexuality, is it bad enough that you want to end your life or is there an alternative? We need to make sure we have as many outlets and alternatives as possible for people.\u201d\nComing out to her parents months helped to lift a weight. \u201cMy mum and dad knew that I was gay, even if I hadn\u2019t told them.\u201d\nThough she never hid her relationship with her partner, Lily, coming out publicly with the Rainbow Laces campaign in 2018 further lifted the weight. Now, talking about the attempt to take her own life is a part of her owning something she thinks about daily. \u201cIt will never leave me,\u201d she says.\nIt is an experience, though, that has made her better able to deal with struggles and manage her feelings. \u201cI now know to talk. When I was younger, during that time, I was never allowed to show emotion. Crying on the pitch was a no go. Because if you cry on the pitch people will think you can\u2019t handle it. Whereas now I cry watching everything on the telly. I\u2019m not going to hide it. I\u2019ll cry over everything.\n\u201cI\u2019m an emotional person and I\u2019m a loving person. I\u2019ve gone through so much worse than that now. But I just think: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to bow down. I\u2019m not going to let anything defeat me.\u2019\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/lionel-messi-will-stay-at-barcelona-pep-guardiola-manchester-city": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/lionel-messi-will-stay-at-barcelona-pep-guardiola-manchester-city", "title": "Pep Guardiola keen for Lionel Messi to finish career at Barcelona", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:10:09 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Manchester City manager: \u2018He is from Barcelona and will stay\u2019<br />\u2022 Raheem Sterling out for weeks with \u2018problem\u2019 injury<p>Pep Guardiola has said he hopes Lionel Messi will finish his career at Barcelona amid suggestions Manchester City want to sign the Argentinian on a free transfer in the summer.</p><p>Messi\u2019s future has been questioned this week after he criticised Eric Abidal following the sporting director\u2019s claim the squad\u2019s form was behind Ernesto Valverde\u2019s sacking as head coach in January.

The 32-year-old \n and the fallout caused speculation that Messi may leave Bar\u00e7a in the summer.\nGuardiola, who managed Messi at Barcelona, was asked on Friday if he might be a target for City. \u201cHe is a player from \n and he will stay there, that\u2019s my wish for him to stay there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about players playing for other clubs. I think he will finish his career there, that\u2019s my wish.\u201d\nAs for his forwards, the manager said Raheem Sterling\u2019s hamstring injury is a \u201cproblem\u201d and may cause him to miss the Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid. The first leg is on 26 February.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hamstring injury and we will see, of course it takes weeks but we\u2019ll see before Leicester [in a fortnight], Madrid and the rest of the games. I don\u2019t know right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem, but it\u2019s a problem we had with [Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan out for six months in the first year [2016-17], and [Aymeric] Laporte this season for four or five months. It\u2019s always a problem. But it is what it is. During the season these kind of things happen unfortunately.\u201d\nCity, who play West Ham on Sunday, are 22 points behind the Premier League leaders, Liverpool, but Guardiola pointed to City\u2019s recent successes. \u201cOne year ago they said we were unstoppable for four or five years,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThen after two seasons of incredible success [it changes]. I don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, we\u2019ll prepare as best we can and try to reduce the gap.\n\u201cWhen we had 100 points they were 25 points behind, then one point [last season] and now look at them. But there are other teams too [who can contend].\u201d City have scored 105 goals in all competitions yet failed to score in their last two matches \u2013 \n and \n.\nGuardiola said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why \u2013 I would like to find the explanation. I don\u2019t have any [reason] to say there was something wrong with my players. I know they want to score goals and score the penalties. Honestly, we concede few against the big clubs and create a lot. We miss a lot of chances. They [the opponents] arrive once or twice and score \u2013 we have to improve on that. We can do more. Putting the ball in the net is the most difficult thing in football and we are going to try to improve.\u201d\nLeroy San\u00e9\u2019s recovery from a serious knee injury, meanwhile, may take \u201cweeks\u201d despite him being back in training with the squad.\n\u201cWhen you have an injury, especially this one for six months, you need to recover tempo and rhythm,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cHe needs time, it\u2019s not a case of him training and he will then immediately be there, it\u2019s not like an ankle or muscular injury. He needs weeks. What\u2019s important is that the surgery was perfect and he\u2019s recovering incredibly well. He\u2019ll come back stronger than before but now he needs a little bit of time.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/safe-standing-across-english-football-step-closer-sports-grounds-safety-autority-report-positive": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/safe-standing-across-english-football-step-closer-sports-grounds-safety-autority-report-positive", "title": "Safe standing across English football moves a crucial step closer", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 11:37:26 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Sports Grounds Safety Authority welcomed by government<br />\u2022 Safe standing \u2018has had a positive impact on spectator safety\u2019<p>Safe standing across English football has come a step closer after a report found it had \u201ca positive impact on spectator safety\u201d.</p><p>The findings, made by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) in an interim report, have been welcomed by government.

They could herald the return of standing to the top two divisions in England for the first time since the implementation of the Taylor report, should they be borne out in the final version of the report due this summer.\nThe SGSA has this season studied behaviour at Celtic Park and Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Westfalenstadion as well as at English clubs Shrewsbury Town, Wycombe Wanderers and Oxford United which are trialling the technology. Their key observation in the interim report is that safe standing \u201chas had a positive impact on spectator safety, particularly in mitigating the risk of crowd collapse.\u201d\nThe SGSA also observe that safe standing has not caused tension between supporters or between supporters and stewards. \u201cThere has been very little conflict as a result of standing,\u201d it said.\nWhile the findings are still provisional, they have met with approval from the government Every political party endorsed the idea of safe standing in their manifestos during last year\u2019s election and the sports minister Nigel Adams reinforced that view in light of the report.\n\u201cI welcome the latest findings from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority\u2019s research. As we made clear in our election manifesto, we will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing at football grounds.\n\u201cHowever it is imperative that football remains as safe as it has become over the past 25 years. Robust evidence that this change will provide equivalent or improved safety for supporters, will be absolutely paramount to this process.\n\u201cThere is more work that needs to be done. The SGSA is continuing to gather evidence over the course of this season, and I have asked them to work with the football authorities to consider next steps as we work with clubs and fans to introduce safe standing.\u201d\n which followed the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989. Since 1994 all clubs in the Premier League and Championship have been obliged to have all-seater stadia.\nStanding is possible in Leagues One and Two, where traditional terracing still remains at many grounds. The trials observed by the SGSA involve one particular type of standing arrangement, rail seating, which involve seats that can be folded away to allow standing and form a barrier at each level of the ground.\nThe EFL commented on the SGSA report stating: \u201cThe EFL is encouraged by the direction of travel being taken on what remains an important issue for the League and its membership. Our position remains consistent in that EFL Clubs, across all three divisions, should be able to provide supporters with the matchday experience they want in accordance with the relevant safety requirements, whether it is sitting or standing in stadiums.\u201d\nThe SGSA\u2019s research will now continue until the end of the season. Should the final report prove positive, it could pave the way to the return of safe standing by the 2021-22 season.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/watford-adam-masina-interview": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/watford-adam-masina-interview", "title": "Watford\u2019s Adam Masina: \u2018What I went through was different from normal life\u2019", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:00:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>Defender lost his mother as an infant, passed through several foster homes as his father struggled with alcohol, and bounced back from rejection by Bologna</p><p>Last weekend\u2019s 3-2 defeat by Everton, to a stoppage-time goal having at one stage been two up and apparently in control, was a particularly bitter experience even for a Watford side accustomed to disappointment this season.

Starts, goals and player of the month trophies seemed very distant only weeks ago.\n\u201cThis year started so bad because I was out of the squad every weekend and I was so sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why I was out because my level of commitment was high as always. It was so, so hard for me. When I joined I was sure that in maybe three, four months I would start to play, and it was so disappointing for me to finish the season as the second left-back. I know now, it\u2019s the past. We look forward. One thing my grandmother taught me is that you have to look after yourself and keep fighting until the end because, if you want something, you have to take it. No one will give it to you.\u201d\nOf all the battles Masina has had to face this one is comparatively trivial. His remarkable story starts in Khouribga, a town about 100km south-east of Casablanca, to which his parents returned, having moved to Italy, so his mother could give birth and raise her baby with the help and support of her family. She died when Adam was a few months old. \u201cI don\u2019t know what actually happened,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was told she got an infection and unfortunately she left us.\u201d He, his older brother, Zakaria, and his father, Mustafa, returned to Italy but his father struggled with alcoholism and the children were taken into care. They passed through several foster homes and, when finally they found one where they felt comfortable, the couple divorced and they had to leave.\nThe boys ended up in Maran\u00e0tha, a shelter for struggling families and children in Bologna, and spent a year there before being reunited with their father. Unfortunately his troubles with alcohol were not over and after one particularly harrowing evening when he dragged his children \u2013 Adam was perhaps four or five \u2013 from bar to bar while they cried and pleaded to return to their last foster home, they were separated for the final time.\nThe only question that Masina refuses to answer during a long and frank conversation is about his current relationship with Mustafa or if there even is one. He has another family now; that last foster couple had divorced but the ex-husband, Raffaele, and his own mother, Teresa, took the boys in and raised them. Eventually they were adopted and both took Raffaele\u2019s surname.\n\u201cWhen I think about myself, about my life, I realise that in the end I was lucky,\u201d says Masina. \u201cI went through something, something different from normal life, but now I\u2019m happy. I have a baby, my girlfriend, my family. For me, I have to be honest, it was easy. It\u2019s not the right word but I\u2019ve realised how lucky I was.\n\u201cOne man took me and my brother and looked after us like sons. Now I\u2019m a father and I\u2019m thinking if I could adopt someone, and it\u2019s hard. You have to work with these kids, to give them discipline, to be right with them. And my father did this with two children. It\u2019s unbelievable, incredible. To have enough love for these two children, the children of strangers. I don\u2019t know what term I can use, more than incredible.\u201d\nZakaria has written a book of poetry about their childhood. \u201cNo, about his childhood,\u201d Masina corrects me. \u201cWe were together but we had a different experience. If you read his poetry, you could compare our stories. As I said before, for me it was easy, because I have got to where I wanted to be. For my brother it was tougher. As of this moment he hasn\u2019t come out the other side. He hasn\u2019t found serenity.\u201d\nIt was at Maran\u00e0tha that Masina was introduced to football, which soon became an obsession. At 11 he was spotted by Bologna and joined their academy, becoming a promising striker, but at 17 he was told he could leave.\n\u201cThat summer was so tough,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember as if it was yesterday. My grandmother, my father and my brother were in a little flat we had rented by the seaside and I cried for an entire month. My grandmother told me not to worry. I remember I said to her: \u2018I want to be a footballer.\u2019 And she said: \u2018OK, but second option, what else do you want to do?\u2019 And I said: \u2018My second option is to be a footballer.\u2019 For her, for me, for my father it was tough.\u201d\nHe ended up at Giacomense, a club in Italy\u2019s regional fourth division based 60km \u2013 a gruelling commute of about an hour and a half each way, by train and bus \u2013 from Masina\u2019s home, where he was converted into a defender. At the end of his first year with them Giacomense played a friendly against Bologna\u2019s Under-23s, a game of, literally, three halves. Masina sat out the first, played the second as striker and the third at left-back, and by the final whistle his old club wanted him back.\nMasina refused to go, believing that he would benefit from a season of senior football, but when they returned for him a year later there was no hesitation. Two strokes of luck followed: they were relegated to Serie B in 2014, when he was 20, and that December their left-back and captain, Archimede Morleo, was injured and Masina was thrust into the team.\n\u201cIn my head I was ready to go on loan, maybe to the third division, because I wanted to play. I was going to leave in just one month,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I got an opportunity, and I took it. That season we got promoted but fucking hell it was hard. By the end we were out of gas, running on fumes, everyone dead. We went up through the play-offs and that night was crazy. I loved it. We were driven through the city on a bus and it was crazy. What a memory. This is the story of my life: highs and lows.\u201d\nHe spent three years as Bologna\u2019s first-choice left-back and played six times for Italy\u2019s Under-21s before moving to \n in 2018. \u201cIt was hard to leave. So hard. But the first day I came here I said: \u2018OK, I like this.\u2019 Because it was like the next level. In Bologna we had a good team but here everyone has quality, everyone is fighting, everyone is running. Everyone has a fire inside.\u201d\nNow they have to show it. After a run of four wins in six unbeaten games over Christmas hauled Watford out of the relegation places, a couple of defeats have seen them slip back in. From here every game, starting at Brighton on Saturday, is potentially crucial. \u201cWe can\u2019t be relegated with this team,\u201d Masina says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. This team has quality, strength, everything. We have everything. I know in the Premier League the level is so high but I think this team is a very good team. This season started so bad. I think with Nigel Pearson we fixed it a little bit, but we have to finish the work, because it\u2019s not possible for us to even think about relegation.\u201d\nIt is going to be a struggle but not one Masina is afraid of. \u201cI\u2019m still fighting, every day. This is my way,\u201d he says. \u201cI know where I\u2019ve come from and I know that you get nothing for free in this life. So I\u2019ll keep fighting.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/07/how-premier-league-clubs-are-using-their-winter-break-this-month": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/07/how-premier-league-clubs-are-using-their-winter-break-this-month", "title": "How Premier League clubs are using their winter break this month", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 11:08:59 GMT", "summary": "<p>The FA says the February break will \u2018benefit club and country\u2019.

We stay here.\u201d\nFeeling more upbeat about it all: third-in-the-table Brendan Rodgers. \u201cI just see this as a great chance for the players to not train, a chance for them to recover mentally.\u201d A chance also for James Maddison to show off his Dubai infinity pool.\nFirst-teamers spent the Shrewsbury replay holidaying in the Maldives, Miami, LA, Dubai, and, in James Milner\u2019s case, Liverpool. \u201cIt\u2019s about welfare, they need rest,\u201d says J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cA mental, physical rest.\u201d\nPep Guardiola says he considered a warm-weather get-together, but then thought better of it. \u201cIn the end I just wanted the guys to be with their families.

We are greedy for wins. We don\u2019t play just to avoid losing.\u201d\nUnited are pressing ahead with their Dubai trip.

And what awaits them now may be even worse.\nA 94th-minute goal from I\u00f1aki Williams defeated Barcelona in the quarter-final of the \n. Obviously they will not win the cup but it takes a leap of faith to believe they will win anything at all. The crisis continues, deeper now. It is institutional but it is sporting, too. Though Unai Sim\u00f3n saved Athletic a couple of times, Barcelona could not really claim they deserved better. They could have won but they could also have been beaten sooner.\nAway from home their results are calamitous, their vulnerability painfully clear, with one coach or the other. There is little to hold on to, little to believe in \u2013 maybe, horrible though it is to hear, not even Messi. For so long they have relied on him to rescue them; here it looked as if he might again. But instead there was impotence, frustration, the smell of failure. At the final whistle the Argentinian held his head in his hands, wearing an all too familiar face. He had the chance to win it \u2013 to win the argument \u2013 and wasted it. Williams on the other hand, did not. \n became a hero.\nIt took a long time for the goal to arrive but it could have come earlier. Ansu Fati had two shots in the first eight minutes. What was most striking, though, was how fast \n lost control, how complicit they were in the game tilting away from them, escaping them like so many others this season. Athletic\u2019s best opportunities began at Barcelona\u2019s feet rather than their own, gift-wrapped for them. Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen passed to Athletic players twice in two minutes, Dani Garc\u00eda sending the first opportunity wide, Unai N\u00fa\u00f1ez unable to make the most of the second. Ter Stegen then got away with a third, fear rising.\nWhen Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Ter Stegen bumped into each other, it was illustrative of their ills. So, too, the moment when Frenkie de Jong, played clean through by Messi, with Sim\u00f3n off his line, took the baffling decision to dive rather than continue past the goalkeeper. The referee did not need the VAR to rumble him. De Jong went over again soon after, buffeted in the box: this was no dive but nor, the referee decided, was it a penalty. Still, there was no way through. Antoine Griezmann, on as a sub, hit Sim\u00f3n\u2019s legs with the best chance \u2013 another one wasted.\nAnother concerning image followed: Piqu\u00e9 pulled down Williams, desperately grabbing on to his shirt as the Athletic forward tried to escape up the right. Williams was far, far too fast for the centre-back, who even got dragged along the floor for a few metres as he hung on, his vulnerability cruelly, comically exposed. Piqu\u00e9 was booked for the 15th time this season and was soon removed, limping.\nWilliams, by contrast, kept running. There were two minutes left when Messi was played in by Arthur. Collecting the ball by the six-yard box, he shot straight at Sim\u00f3n. In the 89th Williams had a chance of his own, with Barcelona\u2019s defence again exposed, but he scuffed his volley from a similar position. There was to be one more, though, and this time he turned his header into the net. It was another dagger in Barcelona\u2019s back. San Mam\u00e9s exploded. Barcelona already had.\nQuique Seti\u00e9n and Gerard Piqu\u00e9 both tried to accentuate the positives after the game. \u201cWe are leaving this competition, it is painful, but the image of the team has been very good,\u201d Seti\u00e9n said. \n\u201cEverything went well today except the result \u2026 I am quite satisfied,\u201d he added. \u201cWe dominated the whole of the second half, but the penalty is not to get ahead with one of those chances. Sadly, the goal has come to us at a time when there was no chance of a reaction.\u201d\nPiqu\u00e9 brushed off questions over Messi\u2019s row with Abidal, saying \u201cit\u2019s not the time to dig up dirt. What I can say is that our confidence is at its highest, we\u2019re happy with the way we\u2019ve played and reacted to the outside noise.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard because we were eliminated [but] we took an important step, we had a very positive feeling,\u201d Piqu\u00e9 added. \u201cIt was a very important step forward.\u201d \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/real-madrid-sociedad-copa-del-rey-match-report": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/real-madrid-sociedad-copa-del-rey-match-report", "title": "Real Madrid dumped out by Real Sociedad in Copa del Rey thriller", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 20:12:43 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Real Madrid 3-4 Real Sociedad<br />\u2022 Ten-man visitors hold on in frantic finale<p>Somewhere amid the din the final second slipped away, the final whistle went and Real Madrid were defeated for the first time in 22 games, eliminated from the Copa del Rey by Real Sociedad.</p><p>Having gone 3-0 and 4-1 down, Madrid seemed to be going out without a fight but there is always a fight here.

In the end, though, Madrid ran out of time, leaving the Basque side heading into the semi-final with a 4-3 win.\nThe competition has been reborn this season, with plenty of upsets after the format was changed to favour the underdog. And yet, the game where there was no advantage for the supposed weaker side delivered perhaps as big a shock as there has been \u2013 not least in the way it happened.\nMadrid, until their late rebellion, were taken apart by a young, dynamic and hugely exciting team that dominated the ball and the chances \u2013 so much so that there were two ovations from the home fans, both for visiting players. Martin \u00d8degaard, on loan from Madrid, was applauded off and so was Alexander Isak, who scored twice.\nBetween them those two players had given Real Sociedad a lead that they ended up being surprisingly close to losing. They had performed superbly, too. \u00d8degaard did not celebrate the opener 22 minutes in \u2013 his shot clipping under the body of Alphonse Areola in goal \u2013 but there was no stopping his teammates.\nSociedad had deserved that opener and might have added to it, too. A second was ruled out by VAR and a handful of first-half opportunities were wasted. When Isak finished brilliantly twice early in the second half \u2013 the first an acrobatic volley, the second a shot smashed into the roof of the net \u2013 it was an act of justice.\nMarcelo scored for Real soon after to suggest there might still be a game after all, only for Mikel Merino to make it 4-1 with 20 minutes to go. The midfielder turned in Isak\u2019s low cross to send home supporters heading towards the exit. It was over, they thought, but they were wrong.\nVinic\u00edus got a goal that was ruled out but the momentum was building and goals from Rodrygo and Nacho set up a noisy, nervous finish. Madrid threw everything forward, with Sergio Ramos missing a late chance and Andoni Gorosabel sent off for the visitors. \nBut it is Real Sociedad who progress, joining Granada, Mirand\u00e9s and Athletic Bilbao, who \n, in an unexpected quartet of semi-finalists.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/christine-sinclair-most-international-goals-canada-women": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/christine-sinclair-most-international-goals-canada-women", "title": "Christine Sinclair, the canny hunter, scores her way into history books", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 10:00:05 GMT", "summary": "<p>Canadian has the most international goals in women\u2019s or men\u2019s football and her tally \u2013 186 and counting \u2013 looks unbeatable</p><p>It was a long time coming.

The celebrations were uncharacteristically bold for a player happy to fade into the background, with Sinclair bowling the ball towards nine players lined up as pins for a strike.\nDespite the small crowd, inferior opposition and small stage, the Canadian\u2019s achievement \na record across women\u2019s and men\u2019s football \u2013 is deserving of praise. Yet she ducks it. \u201cFor me it has nothing to do with the record, it\u2019s to have young girls be able to dream of playing professionally or represent their country, win Olympic medals,\u201d she said. \u201cTo inspire young girls to pursue their crazy, wild dreams ... it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\nShe scored against Mexico on Tuesday too and 186 goals, and counting, in 291 appearances is phenomenal. If Wambach\u2019s record seemed unbeatable, Sinclair\u2019s seems even more so.\nThe game is changing. As professionalism increases, as the talent pool grows, as players are thrown into competitive environments from younger ages and there is a constant stream of talent ready to replace those coming towards the end of their careers, the longevity of players shrinks.\nCanada has the second-highest number of women playing organised football in the world, with 290,087 players, behind the 9.5 million in the US\n(according to the \n) and Sinclair has been the jewel in the crown of the Canada women\u2019s team for 20 years, from the moment she stepped in at 16 in 2000. Their narrow semi-final defeat by the USA at the London Olympics in 2012 was perhaps the defining game of her career; the unplayable forward became one of only three players to have scored a hat-trick against their opponents, before Canada were knocked out by an \n.\nShe has an ability to find space where there is none. Her goals to games ratio, one in close to 1.5 matches, is testament to her determination to wait for an opening. She lurks like a hunter, waiting in defenders\u2019 blind spots before pouncing. Her goals may not be worldies \u2013 though there are a few of those \u2013 but they are calculated.\nThe Portland Thorns player has shaped and managed her career around the national team. In the run-up to the 2015 World Cup in Canada she played nine club games; in 2016 she played 12 times for the Thorns.\nBut Canadian Soccer has done little to help her to her record. It could be argued that, with better commitment from the governing body, Sinclair would have passed Wambach\u2019s record much sooner. It has hosted only nine home friendlies since that World Cup in Canada, including one in 2019 and two in 2018.\nIt will take someone special to topple this record. Vivianne Miedema, a very different player to Sinclair but with a similar attitude to the limelight, is on 69 Netherlands goals at 23 years old. At that rate she could catch the veteran\u2019s number, but the game is getting tougher, opponents are getting better and Miedema is playing a huge number of club matches for Arsenal.\nThe seemingly impossible, though, is possible, as Sinclair\u2019s dethroning of Wambach shows. The American forward said as much in a moving \n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to live and play in a way honoring that legacy and privilege, so that little girls coming up after us will accomplish things we\u2019ve only dreamed of,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo, as a girl who grew up dreaming of winning Olympic gold for my country before women\u2019s soccer was even an Olympic sport, tonight I am celebrating.\n\u201cTonight, I am celebrating the honor of passing that record, that legacy of our beautiful game, to the great Christine Sinclair: world-record holder for most international goals man or woman in history. Christine: History is made. Your victory is our victory. We celebrate with you.\n\u201cTo every girl coming up in the pack with a dream to do something that doesn\u2019t yet even exist: We believe in you to accomplish that we can\u2019t even yet imagine.

However, if the outcome of Thursday morning\u2019s pow-wow between the good and the great of the 20 member clubs is anything to go by, the reality is far more prosaic and mundane.\nIt is not often the Premier League members vote for any wheeze that is not entirely in their own interests, but they are prone to the occasional rick. Their wheeze to close the past two summer transfer windows prior to the start of the season proved a grave misstep, as it gave their European rivals an extra three weeks to shamelessly court, unsettle and plunder their players, leaving squads full of holes they couldn\u2019t fill. It is an error they have \n, deciding to once again fall in line with the rest of Europe (as the country they represent falls out) and move this year\u2019s closing date back to 1 September.\n\u201cOne of the reasons is because the immigration system is going to change and it may be that it\u2019s the last window where freedom of movement is possible,\u201d cheered Premier League chief suit Richard Masters. \u201cClubs may want to take advantage of the longer window to make sure that they\u2019ve taken full advantage.\u201d Any changes to the immigration system will, of course, be prompted by the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union which, while \u201cdone\u201d in the Tory sense of the word, remains so hopelessly up in the air that nobody yet knows how it will affect football transfers. While many of the more vocal and patriotic Union Jack-wavers among the fanbases of assorted clubs may be delighted that Boris Johnson and his cronies have succeeded in \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it remains to be seen how thrilled they\u2019ll be when they discover their team has been stymied in its attempt to sign some midfield schemer from Portugal or Germany because their CV doesn\u2019t tick the requisite boxes required for them to secure a work permit.\nAnd while that Chelsea fan who gatecrashed a live Irish news report to raucously eff and jeff his support for both his football team and the UK\u2019s withdrawal in Parliament Square last Friday might argue these restrictions would only apply to players who aren\u2019t much good, they would be wrong. Had he required one, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is just one of several hundred European players in English football\u2019s top two tiers who wouldn\u2019t have had enough international caps to qualify for a work permit before moving to England. One shudders to think how Chelsea would have fared in recent years without him.\n\u201cWe have identified inaccuracies in the translation of Sky Sports News\u2019 interview with Alfredo Morelos. We apologise to both football clubs as well as Alfredo Morelos for the issues caused by these errors. After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future.

One question: are their translations not normally up to a \u2018professional\u2019 standard? Anyhow, the Queen\u2019s Celtic have responded by lodging a complaint with Ofcom and publishing said letter in full.\n\u201cContinuing the thread of pre-match music (Fiver letters passim), I remember going to see the original Wimbledon playing my team, Stockport County, and listening to the DJ discussing how he had thought long and hard about the music to play to show empathy to Chelsea who had suffered a defeat that week in Big Cup. And then he played the \u2018chorus\u2019 of \n\u201d \u2013 Brian Ross.\n\u201cOnce went to a pre-season friendly between Leamington and Leicester.

Happily, that is often the best kind of all.\nIn February 1838 some 300 people congregated on the Harewood House fishpond, just outside Leeds, to see Harewood score a remarkable 447 runs, with Hugh Barrett at one point scoring 13 with a single shot.\n\u201cThe pond is 48 acres, and the ice that day was as smooth as glass,\u201d Barrett later recalled. \u201cWe had a board for the wicket, with bails on the top, and fine sawdust strewn all about the wickets and the 22 yards.\u201d\nAt stumps their opponents, the neighbouring Stank CC, were on 213 for four, with Holdsworth on 93 not out and the game due to resume the following morning, but an overnight thaw ensured there would be no more play on the fishpond that winter.\nIn early 1867 Robert Carpenter, one of the great batsmen of his age, starred in a match played in far from ideal conditions in Cambridge. \u201cSome part of the ground, or rather the ice, was covered with water, and a genius proposed to make a hole to draw it off,\u201d reported the Sportsman. \u201cOf course the proposal had the contrary effect, the weight of the skaters causing the water to pump up from the breakage.\n\u201cDoubts were now entertained by many as to the match being played, but, nothing daunted, the game was commenced in a fair inch of slush, some parts of the ice looking very much like sodden lump sugar.\u201d (That day\u2019s paper also contains a news story about \u201can ordinary-sized orange\u201d purchased in Dundee that contained \u201canother orange of a smaller size inside, perfectly formed\u201d.)\nA couple of weeks earlier (it sounds like a cold month) many of the great figures of Nottinghamshire\u2019s early years were involved in a game played entirely on skates. Jemmy Grundy, who represented the county for more than 20 years \u2013 playing his final first-class fixture in 1873, the year he died of gout aged 49 \u2013 organised (not very well) and played (only slightly better).\n\u201cWith the usual amount of blunder at the ball, owing to all using skates, the game proceeded merrily for an innings each,\u201d wrote the Nottingham Journal, \u201cthe only interference being that several of the numerous bystanders kept fielding the ball, and on the second innings being commenced many began sliding near the wicket, and the game had consequently to be abandoned.\u201d\nCharley Brown was on the other side and, according to the Sporting Life, he \u201ckept the players and spectators (of whom there were many) in very good humour, by his rough but lively jokes\u201d. Brown, commonly known as Mad Charley, was a genuine one-off, a wicketkeeper who could bowl, fast and accurate, by whipping his right arm behind his back to propel the ball from somewhere near his left armpit. His hands were said to be so swift that sometimes, when the ball narrowly missed the stumps, he could flick off a bail without anyone seeing a thing.\nBrown was a dyer by trade, but his employers found \u2013 according to his former teammate Richard Daft \u2013 that when cricket was discussed at work \u201cCharley got so excited that he would splash a lot of his dye into the tub of his fellow workman, whose cloth in consequence would come out a most remarkable colour\u201d. He was eventually told that he had to give up either his cricket or his job, and dumped the job.\nIn January 1880 Swansea and Cadoxton played on a frozen pond near Neath; Swansea were soundly beaten, and one member of the victorious team earned particular praise for his fielding: \u201cNot less remarkable than a cricket match on skates is the participation by a retriever in the game,\u201d read one report, which noted that Cadoxton \u201cwere much assisted by the admirable fielding of their canine comrade\u201d (Bob the Retriever appears on the scorecard as their No 11; he was dismissed without scoring).\nOn New Year\u2019s Day 1929 the journalist and writer JC Squire organised a game at Hambleton between his literary team, the Invalids, and one called the Hampshire Eskimos, in protest at the idea of football being played in August. Play was disrupted for a while by the Hambleton Hounds, who passed across the wicket while on a fox hunt.\nThe Athletic News cricket correspondent, an ex-player known cryptically as the Gentleman in Black, was a particular fan of ice cricket. \u201cMy experience of such events is that play generally proceeds in an unbroken roar of laughter, for in no other phase of the game is \u2018the glorious uncertainty of cricket\u2019 so much in evidence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFieldsmen, without the slightest warning or intention, are apt to stand suddenly on their head; a bowler, when delivering, is almost as likely as not to arrive before the ball at the striker\u2019s wicket; and the efforts of the batsmen to turn in an attempt to gain a second run for a hit are generally mirth-provoking.\n\u201cMatches in the depths of winter may not appeal much to our leading critics, yet they involve plenty of exercise for the players, provide fresh air for the lookers-on, who might otherwise be at home studying their favourite classics in a stuffy atmosphere, and \u2013 last, but by no means least \u2013 they give one an excellent opportunity of meeting old friends.\u201d\nYet, despite all of that, ice cricket has all but disappeared from Britain. Perhaps it\u2019s because public interest has cooled, perhaps because the climate has warmed, most likely a combination of the two, but these days anyone tired of studying their favourite classics in a stuffy atmosphere has little choice but to look to St Moritz instead.\n \n.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/footballers-who-share-their-names-with-film-titles-redux": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/footballers-who-share-their-names-with-film-titles-redux", "title": "Footballers who share their names with film titles redux | The Knowledge", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:14:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Plus: long-distance city namesake teammates, poor old Jon Macken, back-to-back Basque bosses and more</p><ul><li><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></li></ul><p><strong>\u201cPort Vale striker Leon Constantine appears to share his name with the titles of two films.

With the Oscars this weekend, what better time to revisit it?\nOur very own Stuart Goodwin gets the ball rolling with \n \n and \n \n, along with former Birmingham City skipper \n \n. He even has a referee in the shape of \n \nThe 1972 rat-based horror \n, according to Peter McIntyre, sets up some potentials: \n (Inter Miami) among them. From this we can get Ben \n (Watford) and Ben \n (Norwich City). \nTim Postins kicks things along. \u201c\n \n (goalkeeper at Exeter City) is a mix of an absolutely awful 1996 Francis Ford Coppola comedy starring Robin Williams and a slightly less awful 1981 Dudley Moore comedy that won two Oscars,\u201d he writes. \u201cEverton striker \n \n is a mash-up of the 2009 movie starring Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried and the slightly obscure 1981 drama Kelly. \n \n (Leiston) and \n \n (Brisbane Roar) also qualify, but just to be flash, here\u2019s a three-fer. If you take 2015 indie sci-fi thriller \n, Colin Farrell\u2019s ridiculous \u2018epic\u2019 \n and the 1973 Roddy MacDowell-starring black comedy \n \u2026 well, I\u2019m sure you can work it out.\u201d\nAnd Robin Clarke goes off on a tangent. \u201cThe question reminded me of another one about seeing things in the classified results,\u201d he begins. \u201cOn Wednesday 24 February 2016 Derby County beat Blackburn Rovers \n. The scorer was \n.\u201d\n asks Andrew Newton.\n \u201cLyon have a couple of good candidates,\u201d reckons Russell Yong. \u201cMemphis (Depay), Tennessee, is 15,622km from (Jeff Reine-) Adelaide. However, the only combination that beats Melbourne-Coventry was created when they signed Bruno Guimar\u00e3es last week; Guimaraes, Portugal, is 17,041km from Adelaide, Australia.\u201d Interestingly, Lyon\u2019s signing deprives Brazil\u2019s Club Athletico Paranaense of a 19,758km pairing, of Guimar\u00e3es alongside Wellington. Russell has more, though. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to fit the criterion of actual cities. Yeovil\u2019s (Courtney) Duffus is 18,162km from (Stuart) Nelson, New Zealand, but Duffus is a village (outside Elgin, Scotland) rather than a city. Similarly, Athletico Paranaense\u2019s Wellington \u2013 again \u2013 is 18,369km from Lucas Halter, a hamlet of Visbek, Germany. We could have had Palmeiras\u2019s Nino (El Nino being a suburb of Murcia, Spain) 19,521km from Wellington (Silva), but alas, the latter was loaned to Internacional earlier this season.\u201d\n Graeme Atkinson pipes up with \u201c(Sammy) Nelson and (Alan) Sunderland (teammates in the 70s and 80s at Arsenal)\u201d.\nAlas, we\u2019re not taking Dwayne Mars playing alongside Louis Moss in a 2011 World Cup qualifier for Barbados (Liam McGuigan) or 1999-2000 Ipswich teammates Mark Venus, Jamie Clapham, Matt Holland and Mick Stockwell\n(Graeme again).\n recalls Benjie Goodhart. \nNot quite, but there\u2019s definitely some embarrassment in this old favourite. \u201cNicky Weaver once replaced former USA international midfielder Claudio Reyna for Manchester City in the Premier League,\u201d recalls John Morgan. \u201cCity were playing Middlesbrough and needed a win to clinch a Uefa Cup place on the last day of the 2004-05 season. Manager Stuart Pearce decided David James would be an effective target man, and brought Weaver on in place of Reyna, \n in an outfield shirt bearing the No 1. James didn\u2019t score, but contrived to cause enough panic that City won an injury-time penalty for a Franck Queudrue handball \u2026 only for Robbie Fowler to miss and blow City\u2019s chance. The only person feeling worse in the entire ground must have been Jon Macken \u2013 a centre forward, one-time record City signing and unused sub watching the farce from the dugout.\u201d\n notes Oliver Farry. \n\u201cCypriot club AEK Larnaca replaced Imanol Idiakez with Athletic Club legend, Andoni Iraola,\u201d tweets GIoryHornet. \u201cThey then rehired Idiakez after sacking Iraola.\u201d\n wondered Justin Horton in 2014.\n were not the only ones to make some foolish promises in the heat of the moment. \u201cBBC WM presenter Paul Franks said \n\u201d reported Paul Waterfield. \u201cHe did it in the mankiest pair of underpants imaginable.\u201d \n\u201cI seem to remember Rodney Marsh, working as a TV pundit, made one that Bradford City would be relegated from the Premier League in their first season in it,\u201d recalled David Smith. \u201cThey stayed up improbably by beating Liverpool in their last game, and I believe Marsh fronted up at Valley Parade to have his head shaved to honour his bet.\u201d This would not be the last time that Marsh would make a rash promise. In 2013 \n: \u201cIf #Stoke are ever the 1st match on MOTD I will drive to Stoke & personally clean every players\u2019 boots\u201d. Days later, \n ensured Marsh was on his way to Stoke with sponge in hand. The former Manchester City man turned up at the club\u2019s training ground but some players turned their backs. \u201c\u2018I will clean my own boots,\u201d said Charlie Adam, \u201che will be too embarrassed to clean them.\u201d The clean boots were signed and auctioned for the Donna Louise Children\u2019s Hospice.\n\u201cHas a player ever picked up an injury during a medical?\u201d asks David McCarville.\n\u201cMark Walters\u2019 middle name is Everton, despite playing umpteen times for Liverpool,\u201d explains Alex Gowing. \u201cDoes any other footballer have a name (first, middle or surname) which was a direct rival of a club they played for?\u201d\n\u201cNigel Pearson looks to have revived Watford,\u201d begins Mike Tomkins. \u201cI discovered he was the boss when Jimmy Glass saved Carlisle in 1999; nine years later and he helped save Southampton from relegation to League One at the expense of future employers Leicester. Of course he went on to famously save the Foxes the season before they won the Premier League. And he was the assistant manager when West Brom beat the drop in 2005. Has any manager been involved in more great escapes?\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit", "title": "David Squires on \u2026 what football can expect in the aftermath of Brexit", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 10:48:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our cartoonist takes a look at the sunlit uplands that are doubtlessly in store for football after Brexit</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/david-squires/products/what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit\">Buy a copy of this cartoon in the Guardian print shop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/david-squires-on\">Take a look through David\u2019s archive of cartoons</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/04/golden-goal-clive-allen-qpr-v-west-ham-1984": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/04/golden-goal-clive-allen-qpr-v-west-ham-1984", "title": "Golden Goal: Clive Allen for QPR v West Ham (1984) | Rob Smyth", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 12:30:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>Allen\u2019s triple drag-back at a muddy Upton Park was the kind of instinctive brilliance that belonged on the Copacabana</p><p>For much of her glorious acting career, Edie Falco had a secret: she didn\u2019t know what she was doing.

It all stemmed from her time at college, when she was surrounded by polished students who could articulate what made for great acting. But Falco was the only one who could produce it.\nAfter sustained success, \n, Falco became comfortable with the fact that, \n: \u201cThere\u2019s certain people who know how to act from a more intrinsic level than an intellectual one.\u201d Probably more than she realises.\nThe principle applies to almost all professional creativity. Those who can, do. But most of them couldn\u2019t teach even if they wanted to. It\u2019s rare to find somebody who is equally accomplished in theory and practice. The great performers usually rely on something else \u2013 an instinct which, at its best, verges on the supernatural.\nTake the example of everyone\u2019s favourite improv theatre: association football. It is analysed like never before, but most of the really good stuff, the Emmy-winning stuff, remains almost impossible to articulate. Ask anybody who has produced a moment of individual brilliance and the chances are they will struggle to explain why or sometimes even how they did it.\nDennis Bergkamp, Kevin De Bruyne, Lionel Messi, Ryan Giggs and \u2013 if you want examples from a different sport \u2013 Ben Stokes and Michael van Gerwen are among the thousands of greats who attest to the importance of instinct. There\u2019s no I in team, but there are plenty in individual \u2013 and in instinct, improvisation, imagination and ingenuity. And every team benefits from the successful demonstration of those.\nQPR were certainly grateful when Clive Allen went on impromptu zigzag through the West Ham defence in 1984. It belongs to a subgenre of solo goal, in which a player abracadabras himself from a space the size of a phonebox through a combination of skill and improvisation. (\n.) But it shares the same quality as 99% of all solo goals: the I-word. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed me to do it.\u201d\nAllen, like all great goalscorers, spent his career trying to find space. That generally involved running on to the ball rather than trying to manufacture it while in possession. But he did a nice sideline in goals that involved the sort of imagination and spatial awareness associated with hipster darlings. Bergkamp or Dimitar Berbatov would have been very happy to score \n, and they would have loved the one at Upton Park.\nIt started with the mundane act of stretching away from goal to control Mike Fillery\u2019s cross, while trying to keep his balance on the muddy surface. Allen turned just outside the D and stopped to front up Billy Bonds, the West Ham captain. Bonds was leaning towards him like a sumo wrestler, waiting for the signal to engage. Their brief stand-off was interrupted when Neil Orr, appearing to Allen\u2019s right, decided to stick his surname in. As he approached, Allen dragged his studs over the ball to move it slightly away from goal, thus partially shielding it from Orr and buying himself a split-second to work out what to do next.\nAllen\u2019s instinct told him to drag the ball again, this time to move it completely away from Orr. As he did so, Bonds saw his chance and lunged optimistically towards the ball. Before he got there, Allen produced a third drag-back to take him out of the game. Orr, meanwhile, was transfixed just outside the area, engaging in a ferocious internal debate as to what day it was.\n\u201cAfter the second drag-back I still had my back to goal, so I had to move it again,\u201d says Allen. \u201cThat\u2019s why I did another drag-back. Each touch led to the next one.\u201d\nOne at a time. It\u2019s the footballer\u2019s cliche, usually used for taking each game as it comes. But most individual goals are created one step \u2013 or, in Allen\u2019s case, one drag-back \u2013 at a time. There\u2019s no bigger picture, no bird\u2019s-eye view or medium-term planning. It\u2019s like an arcade adventure game, where your only concern is to avoid being zapped by the nearest defender.\nFor all Allen\u2019s eye-catching drag-backs, the best touch might be the one that followed, an instant push into the space in front of goal. \u201cThe ball actually got away from me a little,\u201d he says, \u201cand I had to stretch to finish it.\u201d\nThe weight of the touch was less important than the angle. Had it been any straighter, Alvin Martin would have been able to beat Allen to the loose ball. Instead he arrived a split-second after the striker, who guided the ball past Phil Parkes and into the bottom corner.\nThe finish was admirably clear-headed; most of us would have been so high on our own skill as to over-excitedly leather it into Row Q. It was a goal of unique brilliance, a Zorroish swish through the West Ham defence, and even more striking in the context of 1980s English football. \n.\nOne of the most memorable things about Allen\u2019s goal was his anti-celebration. He walked away, almost po-faced, with nary a hint of a smile. At first we assumed this was faux-nonchalance, the pose we all struck when we fluked a screamer in the park as kids. But it was actually because of the match situation.\nWest Ham had battered \n and should have led by much more than 2-0 when Allen scored. Allen\u2019s wasn\u2019t a consolation goal, as there were 14 minutes remaining, but at the time it probably felt like it. \u201cIt was because of the way the game had gone,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd maybe, in the moment, I didn\u2019t realise quite how good a goal it was. I didn\u2019t see it as a spectacular goal that I was gonna go crazy about. Now I look at it and think, yeah, the drag-backs were quite something.\u201d\nAllen \ncelebrate wildly when he scored a tap-in nine minutes later to give QPR an unlikely draw. He had missed much of the season, but the West Ham double came near the start of a brilliant run of 10 in 10 games. It had a huge impact both on him and his team. At the end of the season he made his England debut against Brazil in the Maracan\u00e3, and soon after moved to Spurs.\nAllen\u2019s goals also helped QPR to finish fifth in their first season after promotion to the first division. Had they won their last two games, they would have ended up in second. Fifth was still good enough for Europe, which was a shock to one journalist who had written at the start of the season: \u201cThe only way this lot will qualify for Europe is through the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d\nMuch was made of their \u201cmagic carpet\u201d \u2013 the plastic pitch that rubbed so many opposing teams up the wrong way. Many away sides in the old Second Division moaned about having to play on it, and that didn\u2019t change when QPR were promoted to the top flight. \u201cThe only difference,\u201d said their manager Terry Venables, \u201cwas that, being the First Division, we got a higher class of complaint.\u201d\nThey had a higher class of riposte as well. QPR won as many away games as any team that season, including the champions Liverpool. They could play on plastic and grass \u2013 or, as Allen showed at West Ham, on mud.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/31/sport-in-2020-calendar-your-month-by-month-guide-to-the-year-ahead": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/31/sport-in-2020-calendar-your-month-by-month-guide-to-the-year-ahead", "title": "Sport in 2020 calendar: your month-by-month guide to the year ahead", "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 20:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>The Olympics and Paralympics head to Tokyo, Euro 2020 sends football fans around Europe, plus the return of the Ryder Cup</p><p>The month begins with the <strong>Six Nations, </strong>as rugby union\u2019s northern giants rebuild after an ultimately unsuccessful World Cup. <strong>Wales</strong> are the holders, but must travel to Dublin and Twickenham.

They sold two strikers, Carles P\u00e9rez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make space for another but, having briefed that it was all tied up, they failed to sign one. Carles Ale\u00f1\u00e1 had gone too, and Jean-Clair Todibo, and Moussa Wagu\u00e9, but still they had not raised enough. No matter, Seti\u00e9n said, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 would be the \u201csigning\u201d: he was on his way back to full fitness and would be \u201cflying\u201d. Then the news broke that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had torn a tendon in his thigh and would miss the rest of the season.\nThe squad are weaker, not stronger, than when Seti\u00e9n arrived; this is not what he was sold. On Wednesday morning only 16 first\u2011team players were named to travel to face Athletic in Bilbao \u2013 and that is everyone they have got. Samuel Umtiti would have to make his own way there: he was wanted in court in the morning, accused of doing almost \u00a3170,000 worth of damage to a flat he was renting. At the weekend, Ivan Rakitic admitted he was unhappy at how Barcelona had tried to force him out. Arturo Vidal\u2019s agents had already begun legal proceedings over a disputed bonus.\nAnd then, as if all that was not enough, on Tuesday night Abidal gave an interview to Sport. In it, he said he was optimistic Messi would sign a new deal and that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s star player was happy at Camp Nou. But what he said in response to that question was eclipsed by what he said in response to others, which in turn changed the veracity of that statement.\nAbidal had suggested some of Barcelona\u2019s players had been \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with the former manager Ernesto Valverde \u2013 \n, in other words. He also said they did not \u201cwork much\u201d. For Messi, long assumed to wield power, the heaviest of dressing\u2011room heavyweights and invariably burdened with responsibility, the accusation was intolerable. It took less than 90 minutes from the first brief advance of the interview going live for Messi to react: it was public and unequivocal, the division and resentment exposed.\nOn Messi\u2019s Instagram account a red circle was drawn around the quote: \u201cLots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much.\u201d Below it, Messi demanded Abidal take responsibility for his actions, accusing him of \u201cdirtying\u201d the players and challenging the sporting director to name names. Messi takes more responsibility than he should; he was not going to take this one, too. Many thought he was right and even those who thought Abidal might be did not consider it a good idea to say so. The damage was done and it awoke the greatest fear: Messi leaving.\nMessi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave at the end of the season \u2013 and for free. As Abidal admitted, all he has to do is communicate that in May. The 32-year-old has said repeatedly he wants to finish his career at Barcelona but has also said he wants to compete and over the past five years he has felt increasingly like Bar\u00e7a do not. Nor does he have long left: at December\u2019s \n for the first time he raised the question of retirement. There is a growing feeling his final years are being wasted and Messi is not immune to that feeling.\nMessi has not won the European Cup for five years. He has watched Barcelona fail to build around him \u2013 whether he is part of that problem is a broader, more complex question \u2013 and seen a generation slip into retirement and not be replaced. He has seen a lack of direction and certainty, four directors of sport and endless advisers under this regime. He has seen the president become vice-president as well and the team become weaker, despite spending \u20ac1,000m since the departure of Neymar. And now this. No wonder he snapped.\nMessi\u2019s response does not come in isolation: there have been small signs of distrust everywhere, glimpses of the divisions opening up, and not just from him. This is the player who stalled on posing for a photo with the president after his last contract renewal, as if reluctant to legitimise him; the player who said the director Javier Faus, who had suggested there was no reason why Messi should get a new contract every year, \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything about football\u201d; who saw his friend Dani Alves suggest that, by leaving, he had delivered a deserved and \u201cclassy blow\u201d to the board.\nSince Neymar left there has been a sense of the club reaching for something that has gone, desperate for a solution that never arrives. The only solution, it often felt, was Messi. He was a shield behind which many hid, a reason for complacency, conditioning everything. He wanted to share that burden, have a team constructed around him. Instead, he must have wondered what else he had to do, why it always seemed to come down to him. In the last few weeks even his best friend Su\u00e1rez has been absent, with Messi cutting an even lonelier figure.\nThis summer Messi watched his other great friend Neymar and Barcelona end up in court, even while they spent the summer supposedly courting each other. And then said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the club did everything they could to sign him.\u201d Messi wanted Neymar but he didn\u2019t get that wish, however much they say he runs the place. The irony of course is that if the response is to sack Abidal, which it might be if only because the alternative is so awful, another short-term fix, it would reinforce the idea Messi is all powerful. Another fire to put out, sparked by Abidal\u2019s hint that player power was too great.\nThere is no player like Messi; his reaction, at least, illustrates he felt the finger pointing at him and was not prepared to let it go. He asked for names: maybe some were not happy, maybe some were not working but do not look at me. And do not hide behind me, either. He has enough responsibility already to take on other people\u2019s errors as his own, to be made a participant of the problems piling up since Seti\u00e9n arrived and well beyond that, failure delivered to his doorstep again. Above all, to be blamed for this mess.\nThe AS journalist Santi Gim\u00e9nez on Wednesday offered a simple response to the accusation Messi runs Barcelona: if only.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/fearful-england-autonomy-paris-six-nations-france": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/fearful-england-autonomy-paris-six-nations-france", "title": "Fearful England need to play with autonomy or Paris may be just the start | Ben Ryan", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 13:34:57 GMT", "summary": "<p>Once again England \u2013 Jonny May apart \u2013 could not respond in adversity and the feeling that they are being over-managed and natural talent suppressed is never far away</p><p>It\u2019s a new chapter for France and the goal is 2023.

They are going to have some growing pains along the way but at the start of a difficult voyage you often get off to a good start. It gives you confidence for the journey to follow.\nIn his book, The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho calls it the principle of favourability or, in simpler terms, beginner\u2019s luck. Maybe because I believe in that, it came so readily to my mind as I watched on at the Stade de France and saw the game unfold.\nAll week in Paris there was a feelgood factor about the French team. The selection of \nwas welcomed across the board as a positive one and it was backed up with staff changes that also gave the feeling of something new afoot.\nAntoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack are the poster boys for the new wave but quickly followed by the likes of the injured Damian Penaud, Julien Marchand, Virimi Vakatawa and Charles Ollivon. I actually think you could keep naming many more \u2013 the production line is long and with lasting talent.\nMedia-wise it was all underplayed and understated. The results of all this were pretty evident in those first 40 minutes. Tackles stuck and momentum was made. The bigger picture is the 2023 World Cup in France and with the age and talent profile of the team they are on course to reach maturity at the right time.\nYou can see there is still more to do and I\u2019m sure France will have some bumps along the way, but the foundations are clearly being put in place. The togetherness was also evident and it was based firmly on effort and outcome. It looked natural, and it just didn\u2019t look like that on the other side of the pitch with England.\nI\u2019m lucky enough in my day\u2011to\u2011day working life to see some amazing high-performance environments. Many of them have so many moving parts that you always have to remind yourself of what really needs the focus. Get too close to everything and the \u201cnoise\u201d can just drown out the \u201csignals\u201d. It felt like that with England. It didn\u2019t always look authentic. It didn\u2019t look owned. Then on comes Ellis Genge and I see a player doing his thing the way he wants and I park that thought.\nMaybe I\u2019m the one that\u2019s over\u2011analysing it all. Then the feeling re-emerges when you notice a forced pat on the back after something on the field that didn\u2019t need that. So it continued. A loop of what looks natural and what looks coerced.\nYou look up at the England coaches\u2019 box and what sticks out is an England security guard who is standing up for the entire game as the coaches watch over their flock. It all just feels overly managed and, while not suffocating, short of breath.\nI don\u2019t think this England team have underperformed in various games for any other reason than they have lacked autonomy and freedom from external control. Having a bus not turn up on purpose or a meeting changed at the last minute is not creating autonomy. It\u2019s creating a false ownership. It\u2019s not creating a mental safety net for the players to really feel they can do what they want without fear.\nIt is not totally absent and you see snippets of ownership and freedom but it\u2019s not shining through as it does with the very best teams. Yes, create structure and clear black-and-white on and off the field. But make what\u2019s inside those guardrails full of autonomy and player-led decisions. That would give enhanced belief and purpose to allow this England team to move on and genuinely reach for the lofty goals they publicly set out last week.\nThis result wasn\u2019t about the French having freedom and England not. It was about a resurgent France that England couldn\u2019t respond to, bar Jonny May\u2019s individual efforts. Selection and Plan Bs are just a side story.\nThe real reason England are not always at the level they can be is autonomy. They need to be truly allowed to be in the driving seat. If it stays the same, well, the rollercoaster will continue.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/premier-league-winter-break-prime-content": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/premier-league-winter-break-prime-content", "title": "Who needs football when Premier League winter break provides prime content? | Marina Hyde", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 14:48:44 GMT", "summary": "The hiatus enables clubs to focus on their football-adjacent core functions \u2013 in association with official partners, of course<p>I cannot think of a more ideal innovation in the Premier League\u2019s consciously uncoupled relationship with football than the winter break.

Tactics, technique, deep analysis \u2013 these are niche interests and obsessions, in which most people largely feign vaguely respectful interest because they\u2019re regarded as being a traditional but clearly tangential part of the much larger experience.

A very small section of people really do care about those things, of course, which is why there is a very small amount of content among the vast tumult of football content to cater to them. But in the main, people would do anything to avoid this stuff.\nBy contrast, they \u2013 indeed, we \u2013 are unable stop talking about what might be termed football-adjacent matters. A huge part of being a football fan in keeping with the times is having well-aired views about things that are not football: people, money, all manner of social media dramas, the antics of a vast firmament of soap opera characters to hate, envy, occasionally even love \u2026 you know the sort of matters. The good thing for the content providers, as we now call the clubs, is those things are happening all week long. It\u2019s not just the odd 90-minutes here and there.\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with all that, you understand. But in this context the winter break is a stroke of absolute genius. It is a break from having to pretend to talk about football, because there is no football \u2013 only all the other, more popular football-adjacent stuff. Having said that, there is a small bit of football, it turns out \u2013 but that is far better discussed in terms of \n for it, as opposed to the actual football itself.\nI have hugely enjoyed the lengthy and lively coverage of the winter break kick-off on the various breakfast shows. I concede it might have been so vigorously discussed in part because it is a novelty. But my strong suspicion is that it was mainly embraced so enthusiastically because it freed everyone from even the pretence of having to discuss football.\nCertainly the absence of football has been remorselessly covered in all media outlets in the days and even weeks leading up to its temporary hiatus. You cannot move for sensational headlines seeking to put you inside the action of the lack of action. Even the headlines set my pulse racing. \u201cPremier League Winter Break Explained: What You Need to Know.\u201d \u201cArsenal\u2019s winter break UNCOVERED\u201d. \u201cHow does the Premier League\u2019s Winter Break Work?\u201d Well \u2026 I want to say that it\u2019s a break? Which happens in winter? But from everything I have managed to glean its mysteries would seem slightly more arcane than those of the Iowa caucus.\nEither way, top-flight football increasingly feels like a world in which football is a plot device \u2013 what Hitchcock called a MacGuffin. You need it for the story to happen, and to provoke the characters you care about into behaving in certain consumable ways \u2013 but in and of itself, it is relatively insignificant in the grand scheme. As Hitchcock explained it once: \u201cThe MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don\u2019t care.\u201d Rather like the FA Cup. In advance of Liverpool\u2019s Tuesday night \n Town, there must have been at least three times as much chat and three times as many articles about J\u00fcrgen Klopp not breaking his winter break to attend it as there were about the game and build-up itself. You could luxuriate in coverage of the row about him not being there, of his pushback against the row, of the technical process via which he might watch the match in absentia and phone in during it, and all the descriptions of how his spirit had permeated the Anfield setup so totally that it would be almost like he was there.\nFor Manchester United, meanwhile, the winter break offers a chance to beef up off-pitch output, particularly in concert with their many official partners. Admittedly, the current travails of the club\u2019s official football partner are unfortunate \u2013 but the break will allow a focus on those United plotlines and content items that are doing much better. \n, for instance, or sponsor relations.\nIt\u2019s all just a slightly different kind of output in the great football-adjacent universe \u2013 like Big Band week on the X Factor, or a camping episode in a popular sitcom. It just means that rather than appearing in content beamed from Old Trafford, this week Fred is appearing in content beamed from the Maldives. Look \u2013 here is an Instagram snap of him shooting off a waterslide! Meanwhile, Victor Lindel\u00f6f is in Morocco! Other dramas? Rising tensions in the Middle East mean United\u2019s \n; rising tensions elsewhere mean Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r must use the time off to solve the fiendish puzzle of how to win more football games.\nWhat a wondrous lot of this stuff there is. If you find yourself at any point wondering whether any of it could technically ever be branded as \u201cfootball\u201d, please don\u2019t. Just relax. Submit. Let the content wash over you like a rainfall shower by Kohler, the principal bathware partner of Manchester United. Give yourself a break. No \u2013 give yourself a WINTER break.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/04/olympic-hopefuls-work-life-balance": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/04/olympic-hopefuls-work-life-balance", "title": "Athletes on the brink: four Olympic hopefuls and a dream far from assured", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 09:00:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>Some athletes in Olympic sports live in a world of certainty with steady incomes and access to resources.

The following four athletes don\u2019t dwell in that world. They have a delicate balance of work and sports in their quest to earn a trip to the Olympics that is far from guaranteed.\nPitts\u2019 pursuit of an Olympic track and field berth has been made possible in part by a surprising activity.\nCalf roping.\nNo, the 5ft 8in triple jumper from Louisiana State University hasn\u2019t changed sports to try something that isn\u2019t on the Olympic radar. She has just trained a couple of rodeo athletes, all part of the employment scramble that has kept her going in the sport more than five years after graduation.\n\u201cTheir main thing was getting off the horse and running to the calf,\u201d Pitts said of her rodeo clients. \u201cYou have to think outside the box. We don\u2019t have a horse we can train on all the time.\u201d\nPitts is employable, having graduated from LSU in 2014 with a degree in kinesiology and a minor in psychology. She has trained athletes, not just in rodeo, who have a need for speed. She also has worked as a personal trainer in a retirement community and as a career counselor in middle schools.\nAnd she has been the bearer of bad news for a few people.\n\u201cBeing a career coach, I\u2019ve had to crush a lot of dreams,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cSometimes, unfortunately, I talk people out of being a professional track and field athlete.\u201d\nPitts isn\u2019t being mean. Just realistic. She knows how tough it can be to stay in the sport without top-tier USA Track and Field funding, big-time sponsorship or the prize money offered at the world\u2019s best meets.\nBut she\u2019s able to keep expenses down most of the time. She\u2019s able to use the facilities at her alma mater, where she works with Boo Schexnayder, one of the coaches in the powerhouse LSU program.\nShe also doesn\u2019t travel much for competition. LSU hosts a couple of meets each year, including an indoor meet that usually kicks off her competitive year in January. (She tends to win.)\nFor national championships, she can qualify for \u201cpre-allocation\u201d money if she gets the right results beforehand. For other meets beyond Baton Rouge, LSU\u2019s home city, she usually pays her own way.\nMedical bills are also a challenge. She has phased off her parents\u2019 insurance and gets Medicaid, but she had to pay a lot out of pocket to have ankle surgery to deal with bone spurs.\nGiven all these obstacles, she has had the passing thought of taking her own career advice and choosing another path, especially when she balanced training with a job that kept her on her feet all day.\n\u201cBoo even asked me, \u2018How are you doing this physically?\u2019\u201d Pitts said. \u201cI was working 32 hours a week and doing track and field. I was just coming back off surgery. I was frustrated with my marks.\u201d\nStill, she has made some national teams, thanks to a series of fourth-place finishes in the US championships. She hasn\u2019t been to the Olympics or world championships, but she has competed in the NACAC (North America, Central America and Caribbean) championships a couple of times. She took third in the 2015 NACAC meet with an official personal best of 13.83 meters and a wind-aided mark of 14.02.\nWith her fourth-place finish in the US championships last year, she earned a spot in The Match, a Ryder Cup-style competition between the USA and Europe.\n\u201cWe went to Belarus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really fun. It got pretty competitive in the end because Europe started pulling away. I was able to end my season on a seasonal best.\u201d\nNow she\u2019s looking toward the Olympics and next year\u2019s worlds.\n\u201c(The Match) gave me that kick in the butt, like, this isn\u2019t it. You have to get on your horse.\u201d\nJust like her training clients.\nGrossman is the fourth-ranked climber in \n and has earned a spot on \n.\nThe bad news for this year is that USA Climbing only gets two berths per gender in the 2020 Olympics, and \n.\nThe good news is that she has plenty of time to get to the Games down the road. She\u2019s a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado.\nShe didn\u2019t have to leave home to go to school. She and her family moved to Boulder, the city with the most appropriate name for a climber and a strong youth team in Team ABC, when she was young.\n\u201cI moved to Colorado right before I started high school,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of (climbing) gyms here. There\u2019s one here every 10 minutes.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a shorter commute than she faced growing up in Santa Cruz, California, where she sometimes had a two-hour trip. Getting back and forth between a gym and college quickly is important for someone balancing an elite climbing career with a couple of psychology courses, biology, ethics and philosophy.\n\u201cI have class every day, so I normally get out around 2.30ish,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cOnce I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll normally study for a little bit. Then I\u2019ll go to the gym after that, normally around 4, and I\u2019ll be there for around 3 hours. Then I go back to school to 7.\u201d\nHer three-hour workouts include some sort of conditioning \u2013 abs, arms or legs, depending on the day \u2013 and she bikes around campus for extra cardio work. But the bulk of her training is climbing, climbing and more climbing. Her gym sets new climbs on its walls twice a week, and she can dial up thousands of different climbs through the Moonboard, a wall that lets climbers pick their own routes through the multitude of holds.\n\u201cI go to the gym and have a plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way I can stick with it and be efficient and not just play around and go, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s been two hours.\u2019\u201d\nWeekends are spent on even longer workouts or competitions, which usually force her to miss Friday classes. She only goes to overseas competitions in the summer.\nSo in general, she has the time-management capability to train and study. What she doesn\u2019t have is financial support beyond the occasional bit of free equipment or prize money \u2013 perhaps $1,500 for a first-place finish somewhere.\n\u201cI have to pay for everything \u2013 my gym membership, flights to competition, hotels,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a shoe sponsorship.\u201d\nShe\u2019s unlikely to follow the Alex Honnold path and have a camera crew record something like Free Solo\nthe Oscar-winning documentary tracing Honnold\u2019s daring ascent up El Capitan.\n\u201cCompetition is my main focus,\u201d she said.\nImagine juggling a job with a sport.\nNow imagine juggling a job with \nsports.\nThat\u2019s the life of Sam Ruddock, an Olympic modern pentathlon hopeful who lives, works and trains in a city where you\u2019d expect to find more actors than athletes.\nNew York? Not Colorado Springs or one of the other hotbeds of Olympic sports training in the USA? Not someplace cheaper?\n\u201cThe way points are skewed, it\u2019s become more and more skewed toward fencing and the run-and-shoot,\u201d Ruddock said. \u201cIf you look at Olympic champions, the winners all won the fence. The best fencing in the country is in New York.\u201d\nBut Ruddock has to do more than fence. He has to swim, run, shoot and ride \u2013 a horse, not the subway.\nSo Ruddock\u2019s typical day may start around 6 or 7am in the pool at the New York Athletic Club. After he swims and stretches, he heads to work. After work, it\u2019s time to run and lift weights. By 6pm or so, he\u2019s fencing. That\u2019s not every day, but he generally swims five to six times a week and fences three to five times.\nRiding is a bit tougher. New Yorkers can\u2019t just hop on a horse and head to Central Park. Instead, he takes the occasional weekend at a friend\u2019s house north of the city.\nThe shooting aspect of the run-and-shoot is also a little tricky, but he can get a little bit of practice in the comfort of his own apartment, from one end of his bedroom to the fridge, or down a long hallway in a relative\u2019s house. Fortunately, the shooting competition was revised several years ago so that athletes use electronic \u201cguns\u201d rather than bullets, so he\u2019s not putting a few holes in the wall, Pulp Fiction-style.\nAnd about once a week, Ruddock heads to a track with his laser gun, a target and a bunch of duct tape, allowing him to mimic the pentathlon\u2019s mix of running and shooting.\nWhen he\u2019s not shooting, riding, swimming, running or fencing, Ruddock can be found putting his economics degree to work.\n\u201cI work at a small consulting firm,\u201d Ruddock said. \u201cWe\u2019re an incubator, essentially. We help start-ups scale quickly. I work mostly on the fund-raising side. For me, it\u2019s kind of like a dream job. The guy started the business about a year ago. He\u2019s fairly flexible with my training. I can go in and out as I please, almost. It keeps me intellectually stimulated as well.\u201d\nIn case all that\u2019s not enough, he recently started playing squash, which gives him a break from the more solitary pursuits of pentathlon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough socially because all I do is work and train mostly,\u201d Ruddock said. \u201cMost social life revolves around bars and drinking and staying out late, and I can\u2019t really do that.\u201d\nRuddock is a second-generation pentathlete who first competed in his teens. He\u2019ll be 27 this summer, and this may be his last attempt to reach the Olympics.\nBut after 2020, you may still find him in a pool in New York \u2013 or perhaps a squash court, tennis court or golf course.\n\u201cTo take a day without working out would be odd for me,\u201d Ruddock said.\nIn a Colorado gym last summer, some NFL players were put into a training group along with other athletes. Among them was a 33-year-old Colorado native who had just moved in with his girlfriend and worked at a start-up.\nThis group of men who make a living in a sport filled with violent collisions were stunned to learn what their training partner does in the colder months.\n\u201cThey all think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d said Stephen Garbett, who competes in the head-first sledding sport of skeleton. \u201cThey\u2019re all like, \u2018\n do you do?\u2019\u201d\nA decade ago, Garbett didn\u2019t know much about the sport himself. But then came a life-altering experience. On a trip home from Beverly Hills, where he was managing a gym, he started to feel ill. He wound up in the hospital for more than three weeks, with appendicitis just part of the problem.\n\u201cIt showed me how precious life was,\u201d Garbett said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve set high goals for myself.\u201d\nOne goal was straightforward \u2013 he would go to college aged 24 and become the first person in his family to earn a degree. The other goal had to do with what was on TV during his hospital stay \u2013 the 2010 Olympics. Skeleton was the sport that caught his attention.\nOff he went to the University of South Carolina, notably not near one of the USA\u2019s two sliding tracks but home to some business programs that appealed to him. He got his degree in sports and entertainment management, then headed for the hills to take part in a combine for prospective sliders.\n\u201cThey\u2019re normally looking for college athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was 27. I was the oldest age that they allow incoming athletes.\u201d\nWhen it was done, he became one of the handful of Americans who compete in skeleton. His status as an international competitor gets him free ice time at Lake Placid or Utah Olympic Park, but it doesn\u2019t give him a steady income. Nor does it pay for his summer training with NFL players and other athletes. Or his travel.\nGood thing he did the college part first.\n\u201cThat (education) has helped me understand gaining sponsorship,\u201d Garbett said. \u201cYou have to understand how to negotiate.\u201d\nHis personal sponsors, USA Bobsled and Skeleton\u2019s team sponsors, and a summer golf tournament help him generate the money he needs to stay on the ice. So does a novel job with a start-up called \n, which is opening hotels that cater to athletes \u2013 including esports stages and viewing areas, Garbett\u2019s department within the company.\nHis offseasons are important. Not only is he able to train, work and be with his girlfriend, but he\u2019s also able to get outdoors and away from the ice for a few months. All of that keeps him from burning out while making a run at being one of the older members of the US team headed for Beijing in 2022, when he would be 36 years old.\n\u201cIn high-level sports, there\u2019s a ton of pressure from the sport, and financially there\u2019s a huge burden,\u201d Garbett said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an escape, you\u2019re not able to perform as well as you could.\u201d\n"}}, "Entertaniment & Arts": {"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/sam-mendes-1917-best-director-oscars-male-dominated": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/sam-mendes-1917-best-director-oscars-male-dominated", "title": "Sam Mendes in final push for glory at male-dominated Oscars", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:00:11 GMT", "summary": "<p>Mendes\u2019s macho first world war drama 1917 is tipped for success on Sunday night, but one thing is certain: the best director winner will be a man</p><p>The Brits are coming back: every awards bellwether so far this season suggests Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama 1917 will scoop best picture and best director at the 92nd Academy Awards this Sunday.</p><p>The film, which was inspired by stories told to Mendes by his grandfather, Alfred, about his time on the western front, took the top prize at the Golden Globes, at last Sunday\u2019s Baftas, and at a wide range of smaller ceremonies including the Producers\u2019 Guild America, which has matched the Oscars\u2019 big winner 13 times already this century.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/sam-mendes-1917-best-director-oscars-male-dominated\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "he Brits are coming back: every awards bellwether so far this season suggests Sam Mendes\u2019s first world war drama 1917 will scoop best picture and best director at the 92nd Academy Awards this Sunday.\nThe film, which was inspired by stories told to Mendes by his grandfather, Alfred, about his time on the western front, took the top prize at the Golden Globes, at last Sunday\u2019s Baftas, and at a wide range of smaller ceremonies including the Producers\u2019 Guild America, which has matched the Oscars\u2019 big winner 13 times already this century.\nLate surges of momentum for Bong Jong-ho\u2019s Parasite and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood notwithstanding, Mendes seems a sure bet for this audaciously executed \u201cone-shot\u201d story of two soldiers\u2019 mission through no man\u2019s land.\nThat film \u2013 like so many others this year, but most notably co-nominees The Irishman, Joker and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2013 is striking for the lack of screen time given to women.\nIt\u2019s no surprise white male narratives continue to dominate, says Katey Rich, deputy editor of Vanityfair.com and host of the Little Gold Men awards podcast. \u201cThe definition of what makes an \u2018Oscar movie\u2019 has evolved over time, but it has almost always meant stories about white men, and it\u2019s going to take more time to shift that.\u201d\nWhen the nominations were announced in January, there was widespread disappointment about the all-male directors category (\n), with Little Women\u2019s Greta Gerwig failing to secure a nod, a decision even Hillary Clinton criticised during a recent interview with \n. \u201cI think that the directors\u2019 branch [of the Academy] could probably stand to bolster its lady numbers,\u201d Gerwig \n this week.\nOutside of the acting categories, \n, among them 32-year-old Scottish writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns for co-writing 1917. This is 5% more women than the year before, but still a long way from parity. \u201cEvery time I say I\u2019m the writer of 1917, people go, \u2018huh?\u2019, and those people are unfailingly male,\u201d Wilson-Cairns \n of her post-nomination experience.\n\u201cWe need to take the focus off the lack of accolades for women and look at the lack of opportunities,\u201d said Little Women star \n \u2013 who is tipped to win the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Marriage Story \u2013 at a lunch this week to honour female nominees. \u201cYou can\u2019t say five movies were made by women, and they got snubbed. Well, OK, but of the 300 guys who got to make them, there were a bunch of guys who got snubbed. We need to change the numbers.\u201d\nThere were also a number of perceived snubs for actors of colour, including Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Murphy and Awkwafina. Cynthia Erivo, who, thanks to her performance in \n, became the only nominee this year to prevent another #OscarsSoWhite, \n her inclusion \u201cbittersweet\u201d.\nThe nominations came despite a study showing that there was a notable improvement in representation of both women and people of colour in the 100 top-grossing movies of 2019. Since 2016, the Academy has been working to expand the diversity of its membership, and despite the whiteness of this year\u2019s nominations, president David Rubin is confident of making progress. \u201cThese programmes do work,\u201d he said at the annual nominees luncheon. \u201cThey are enormously effective \u2026 Excellence is enhanced when we widen our lens.\u201d\nBut there is still uncertainty about how to police what and how many films Academy members choose to watch before voting. Last month, Melina Matsoukas, who directed the racially charged romantic drama \n, \n that Golden Globe voters were declining to show up to screenings, while Little Women producer \n there was an unconscious bias that meant male voters were rejecting her movie.\nAt last month\u2019s Sundance film festival, which featured more female-directed films than ever before, Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan \na new way to prove viewership. \u201cI wonder if the system works in terms of getting sent 100 screeners,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote unless you can prove you\u2019ve seen every single one. There should be a test. The films that did get left out are indisputably brilliant.\u201d\nBut Oscar experts remain unsure. Rich added: \u201cIt feels like they\u2019ve tried a lot, but there\u2019s only so much you can do before you just have to wait for the passage of time \u2013 and for Hollywood to continue getting more diverse, too.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/07/crooked-preachers-and-sexy-priests-has-tv-got-a-problem-with-christianity": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/07/crooked-preachers-and-sexy-priests-has-tv-got-a-problem-with-christianity", "title": "Crooked preachers and sexy priests: has TV got a problem with Christianity?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:29:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>Christians on TV were once limited to ethical debates and Songs of Praise.

Broadcasting guidelines required both main networks to screen not only sacred song anthologies, but also live church services, and late-night \u201creligious and ethical\u201d discussion shows. The emphasis was almost always on respecting Britain\u2019s residual state religion, Christianity.\nIncreased competition for viewers caused by channel expansion led networks to pray successfully for release from days of holy obligation: Songs of Praise, though relegated to a BBC1 Sunday lunch-time slot, is the last relic of the old-time religion in the schedules, except for specials to mark Christmas, Easter and, now, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh festivals.\nBut, though the God slots have gone, religion seems to be achieving a televisual second coming. Two series about American Christian evangelical families have launched coincidentally in the UK this week: HBO\u2019s The Righteous Gemstones (Sky Comedy) and MGM\u2019s Perpetual Grace, Ltd (StarzPlay). On Netflix, \n, in which a Christ-like bearded preacher figure appears in the contemporary Middle East, proved a recent hit.\nNext month, when the 2020 Bafta TV award nominations are announced, there seems sure to be mass recognition of the second season of Fleabag, an agonised \u201clove story\u201d between Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s libidinous singleton and Andrew Scott\u2019s \u201chot priest\u201d. Netflix\u2019s The Young Pope, which won \n an Emmy nomination as a pontiff as likely to be seen in Speedos as white robes and papal tiara, has just been followed by a sequel, The New Pope.\nThe fear of faith-leaders and believers, though, is that this new religious broadcasting sees the obligatory reverence of earlier TV decades replaced by ritual ridicule.\nThe Righteous Gemstones and Perpetual Grace, Ltd are dark comedies that present American evangelical churches as cynical and hypocritical exercises in fleecing the vulnerable out of money while their pastors live like rock stars. John Goodman\u2019s Pastor Eli Gemstone has a fleet of three private jets, named The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit. Played by Ben Kingsley, who has curiously chosen to channel the accent of Anthony Hopkins, Pastor Byron Brown, CEO of Perpetual Grace, Ltd, says, when finances are mentioned: \u201cWe do alright \u2013our church,\u201d but we know to take this as severe understatement.\nThis suggestion of American evangelism as fraudulent cant and deception descends from Sinclair Lewis\u2019s influential 1927 novel Elmer Gantry, in which a con-man joins a revivalist preacher; it was filmed in 1960, with Burt Lancaster as the fraud for the Lord.\nA newer influence on the two new American TV variations on this narrative, though, is the present US president. Although Donald Trump has been married three times, and his frequent claims of not having time to read books were assumed to include the Bible, the Christian fundamentalist vote was key to his election, and, as he seeks a second term, he has been filmed praying with believers. So The Righteous Gemstones and Perpetual Grace, Ltd - in exploring the uses and mis-uses of piety - can be seen as part of liberal Hollywood\u2019s response to the shock of the 2016 election.\nIndeed, while the Bible shows Christ telling secular stories \u2013 about wise and unwise virgins, or the best way to serve wine at a wedding \u2013 to make religious points, this wave of TV dramas are often parables that use religion for secular purposes.\nBoth The Young Pope and The New Pope, Messiah and Riders of the Storm (a Danish church drama by Borgen creator, Adam Price, seen here on Channel 4) all use ecclesiastical power struggles as a proxy for contemporary politics. Each employs thriller tropes, such as conspiracy and espionage: in Messiah, the CIA and Mossad investigate who the rumoured second Jesus really is.\nLess generically, The Young Pope, \n and Riders of the Storm offer frequent parallels with parties and parliaments. This is tempting because the tensions in church leaderships between orthodoxy and reform, purity and pragmatism, are exactly those that play out in the Commons, Congress, and other legislatures.\nAlthough Roman Catholic cardinals are asked to \u201clisten to the Holy Spirit\u201d while choosing the next occupant of the throne of St Peter, director Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s sumptuous big-budget reconstructions make clear that the process is as prone as any other electoral process factions, tactics, and mistakes.\nBy having John Malkovich\u2019s John Paul III serve while Jude Law\u2019s Pius XIII lies in a coma, The New Pope contrives an ideological fight between supporters of two living pontiffs, a strand that would once have seemed absurd but is being played out in the real Vatican as the retired Benedict XVI shadows his successor Pope Francis. (A situation explicitly dramatised in Netflix\u2019s multi-Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes).\nYet Sorrentino\u2019s series, while properly referencing the paedophile and financial scandals that have damaged Catholicism, are not satirical about faith or religion. Law\u2019s Pius XIII is essentially a good man who may justify another character\u2019s description as \u201cthe only pure soul who ever set foot\u201d in the Vatican. In these shows, a Pope is seen as dangerous if he turns the work of the church towards God or human justice rather than priestly power.\nIn the Bible, Christ frequently warns that it is not possible to serve both God and Mammon. Though differing in tone and approach, The Righteous Gemstones, Perpetual Grace, Ltd, and both The Young Popeand The New Pope all critique the contemporary Christian churches for using God as a means to make money. Rightwing and evangelical believers may dismiss this as a leftwing economic agenda, but the message is Biblically respectful.\nEven Sorrentino\u2019s tendency to risk giving Jude Law a chill \u2013 he is seen wearing only swimming trunks in the first season, his genitals covered by a skimpy hospital towel in the second - might charitably be seen as an acknowledgment that Christ died not in a neck-to-foot cassock but nearly naked in a loincloth.\nAnd, although the second run of \n features a Catholic priest breaking his vow of celibacy, the show never doubts the faith of the Andrew Scott character. What is remarkable about the sex scene is that it is retrospectively revealed to have been the priest testing whether sex could ever bring him the rewards that his love of God does. It is a measure of the complexity of Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing that an act that is, in the terms of the character\u2019s professional contract, a sin, becomes an unexpectedly reverent affirmation of his beliefs.\nThe God slot may have been gone, but it seems the new slots religion is finding on TV can be a more intelligent and interesting exploration of faith and theology than the late Roy Castle or Sir Harry Secombe singing hymns in a cardigan on a Sunday afternoon.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/ryan-beatty-was-set-to-be-the-next-bieber-then-he-realised-he-was-living-a-lie": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/ryan-beatty-was-set-to-be-the-next-bieber-then-he-realised-he-was-living-a-lie", "title": "Ryan Beatty was set to be the next Bieber \u2013 then he realised he was living a lie", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:00:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>After an epiphany on a plane, the LA singer-songwriter came out and found the freedom he needed</p><p>Ryan Beatty was flying home to LA after a gig when he had an epiphany. \u201cI remember we were about to take off and I just told my manager: \u2018I can\u2019t do this any more,\u2019\u201d he says of that life-changing moment in 2013.

His lack of confidence was not helped by the fact he was locked in bitter legal wrangles with his old label and management, only free to release music again in 2016.

His punishing regime for depressed middle-class female patients involved strict bed rest with no reading, writing, painting and, if it could be managed, thinking.

Gilman wrote later of her treatment, which felt more like a prison sentence, \u201cI \u2026 came perilously close to losing my mind.\u201d\nWhich is exactly what happens to the narrator of \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d, as she discovers that having \u201cno congenial work, with excitement and change\u201d leaves her ravenous imagination at the mercy of unnamed terrors. As her mood darkens, she starts to notice unsettling things about her room: there are bars at the windows, iron rings on the walls and her bed has been nailed to the ground. More oppressive still is the sulphurous yellow wallpaper with its weird smell and sinister pattern.\nIt is at this point that the reader starts to wonder whether the narrator is to be trusted. Can it really be, as she is now suggesting, that her husband and his sister are acting, not as her caretakers, but as her jailers? And what about the figure of the woman whom she claims to have spotted creeping about under the noxious yellow paper? Are we to interpret this as a potent symbol of the narrator\u2019s repressed creative desires, her psychic shadow? Or is she simply insane?\nThe story\u2019s \u201crefusal to be reduced to a single interpretation is what makes it such a fertile work\u201d, says Gail Marshall, professor of Victorian literature and culture at the University of Reading. Indeed, in the hundred plus years since its publication, these 6,000 words, which so convincingly skewer female oppression at the hands of the patriarchy, have mutated into endless new forms. \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d has been staged countless times both as a one-woman show and as an ensemble piece. It has lent itself to radio drama and has made it several times on to television, once even providing the plot for an episode of \n. There have been at least eight cinema versions, the most recent by Kourosh Ahari, which transferred the action to 1950s America.\nIn the last three years, though, this seminal text has taken on a renewed urgency. \u201c\u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 speaks directly to our #MeToo moment,\u201d Marshall says; she points to the very particular kind of power that the husband in Gilman\u2019s story seeks to exert. There is no crude physical violence in evidence here, not even a cross word. Instead what the narrator describes is a kind of psychological torture, in which her own sense of reality is constantly assaulted: \u201cJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him.\u201d Here, Marshall suggests, is a textbook account of what we have only recently come to recognise, let alone give a name to: \u201ccoercive control\u201d. An older term for it might be \u201cgaslighting\u201d.\nIn such a rich context, then, it\u2019s no wonder that Gilman\u2019s tiny masterpiece is busy morphing into vibrant new forms. On 22 February a show by the American Nigerian artist \n opens at the William Morris Gallery in east London, consisting of a series of female portraits made explicitly in conversation with Gilman\u2019s classic feminist text. At first glance Wiley, who became well known in 2018 when he painted Barack Obama\u2019s portrait for the Smithsonian, might seem an unlikely fan of the story. The Yale-trained artist, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, is best known for his hyperreal portraits of mostly working-class men and women of colour dressed in vibrant streetwear. His monumental figures gleam with health and confidence, a world away from the pale, neurasthenic Wasp-ish woman whom we picture as the narrator of \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d \u2013 someone who looks a lot like Gilman in fact. \nFor his new show, Wiley and his team went looking for female subjects in nearby Dalston. \u201cThe streetcasting went extremely well,\u201d remembers the curator, Rowan Bain. \u201cWomen were invited back to the gallery to be photographed, and Kehinde worked from those images.\u201d Yet the figures that will go on show are much more than character sketches drawn from contemporary streetlife. Wiley\u2019s practice has always depended on self-consciously inserting his subjects into the formal traditions of European high art. \nThis is swagger portraiture, done in the tradition of a Rococo master such as \n or with the silky suggestiveness of a\n. The ornate gold frames resemble something \n might have ordered. And then there are the backgrounds. More often than not Wiley positions his figures, complete with tight black leggings, gigantic shades and Nike slogans, against a repeating floral trellis design reminiscent of a piece of classic\n, saturated with the colours of West African \n (prints). The point, Wiley suggests, is to bring together these clashing traditions as a way of thinking about the historical exclusion of certain kinds of bodies from the privileges of high art.\n\u201cThe question of race is hiding in plain sight in \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019,\u201d Marshall argues. The tendency, ever since Gilman\u2019s short story was rediscovered by second-wave feminists in the 1970s, has been to read it as the escape of a bourgeois white woman from the prison of the patriarchy. But look carefully, Marshall suggests, and you will see that something more complex is going on. The building in which the narrator is imprisoned is an old \u201ccolonial\u201d mansion, dating from the age of slave-keeping in America. The shackles in the room hint at the violent physical restraint of black bodies. And it is not just one woman crawling under the wallpaper. By the end of the story the narrator has spotted \u201cso many\u201d women who she believes have scrabbled free from the garish yellow prison. \u201cWhat we are looking at here is a powerful moment of women coming together to act collectively,\u201d Marshall says.\nIt is this resonance of Gilman\u2019s writing to contemporary women\u2019s lives that first caught the attention of Lindsey Mendick, a young artist and sculptor whose show \n has just opened at \n. \u201cThe moment I read Gilman\u2019s short story, the parallels with my own experience felt uncanny,\u201d Mendick says. At 18, felled by anxiety and depression \u201cwhich no one knew how to help\u201d, she dropped out of art school and retreated to a small bedroom in her parents\u2019 house in north London. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything, but the less I did, the more ill I became. Each day a new terror would seize hold of me and I would ruminate obsessively.\u201d\nAgoraphobic, insomniac and prey to constant panic attacks, Mendick\u2019s mental health deteriorated to the point where she feared that she had begun to hallucinate. \u201cOne night I looked out of the window of my bedroom and saw six men in black with walkie talkies swarming around our cul de sac. It was terrifying, like the realisation of all my worst fears.\u201d Mendick\u2019s parents assumed this was simply the latest symptom of their daughter\u2019s fragmented mental state, but a few days later, the news broke: the family\u2019s neighbour had been the former Russian spy \n, and he had been poisoned.\nMendick\u2019s new show sets her own chilling experience in conversation with that of Gilman\u2019s narrator. \u201cI wanted to explore a domestic gothic, the terror that can lurk within very familiar, homely objects.\u201d\nThere is yellow wallpaper here, but it is not the Arts and Crafts swirl described in the original story and even in Wiley\u2019s rendition. Instead, these are stark mid-20th century geometric shapes that come to resemble the repetitive bars of a grid, a grille or a prison. Mendick\u2019s family are referenced by a series of nesting Russian dolls, and Litvinenko\u2019s story is there too, in the form of a tiny Putin head and some sinister looking sushi rolls (the poisoning of the Russian defector was thought to have taken place in a central London Japanese snack bar). In Mendick\u2019s world, as in \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d, it is \u201cthose intimate, domestic, scaled-down spaces which are supposed to make you feel safe which turn out to be the most terrifying of all\u201d.\n \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/green-day-rocknroll-helps-you-dance-through-the-apocalypse": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/green-day-rocknroll-helps-you-dance-through-the-apocalypse", "title": "Green Day: 'Rock'n'roll helps you dance through the apocalypse'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:00:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Can the world\u2019s biggest punk band capture the zeitgeist on their new album like American Idiot once did?

How did that happen?\u201d Recently, he attended a show only to be confronted by a young punk with giant liberty-spiked hair, \u201clooking like he\u2019d just walked out of a squat\u201d, asking for a selfie on a brand-new iPhone. \u201cIt\u2019s cool and it\u2019s weird,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m just excited people are still doing cool shit.\u201d\nGreen Day\u2019s new album is titled Father of All Motherfuckers and yet, surprisingly for a band best known for delivering 2004\u2019s George Bush-baiting rock opera \n, they say Donald Trump had little influence on the new record. At the same time, they insist it is political.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all there in the songs,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI\u2019m singing about \u2018looking out for the jingoes and heathens\u2019 or \u2018another black kid shot in town\u2019.\u201d There\u2019s a lyric about bulletproof backpacks designed as protection during school shootings, \u201cone of the most absurd ideas I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. But Armstrong doesn\u2019t want to be on the nose. \u201cEverything that is happening in the world is right there on Twitter. It\u2019s so confusing and it\u2019s so depressing. I really wanted to create some kind of escape for people; I didn\u2019t want to be so obvious.\u201d Satirical punk site \n wrote a story the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration titled \n. \u201cIt was funny, but I didn\u2019t want us to do that. It wasn\u2019t where our heads were at \u2013 at all.\u201d Where were your heads at? \u201cI was listening to Little Richard.\u201d\nHe continues: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m ignoring it, it\u2019s just that the current political climate is something I just can\u2019t draw any \n from. I\u2019ve got tons of feelings about it. I think Trump is a piece of shit. I think [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell is pure evil. All they care about is looking after the rich and they don\u2019t care about the common people. But I find no inspiration there. It\u2019s so depressing. It\u2019s hard to dance when you can\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the world has become so divisive,\u201d says drummer and band goof Tr\u00e9 Cool. \u201cWe wanted to try to bring people together. It\u2019s become something of a far-out concept to love each other!\u201d\nThis year the band will turn 34. No punk band has made it this far. The Sex Pistols lasted three years, the Clash 10, the Ramones 22. Green Day are writing the blueprint while living it, so it is no surprise that they have sometimes made mistakes. \n on his covers album California Son \u2013 a terrible look in the wake of Morrissey\u2019s vocal support for far-right organisations and individuals.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware until the song came out,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cWe do the song, and he was very lovely, and then the song comes out and a lot of Brits were like: what the hell are you doing? I really did not have a clue \u2026 \u201d Bewitched by the singer\u2019s status as an 80s indie godhead, he simply failed in his due diligence. Cool pipes up, giggling: \u201cHey, we\u2019ve all got our Ted Nugents, right?\u201d \u2013 a reference to the US rocker and gun enthusiast.\n have endured major wobbles and are now in \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d as Armstrong puts it. \u201cPeople get over their high school bands. They don\u2019t go on to spend every day in their orbit for the next 20 years.\u201d\nAfter two records on the late, great East Bay punk imprint Lookout!, in 1994 the young band signed with major label Reprise. The punk scene was aghast. 924 Gilman Street, the puritanical Berkeley-based all-ages headquarters of said scene banned the group from performing. Green Day released Dookie in February of that year and it sold 20m copies. They wouldn\u2019t return to play Gilman Street until 2015.\nOld friends and fellow scenesters might not have wanted to talk to them any more, but everyone else did. Along with Smash, the third album by fellow Californians the Offspring (at 11m sales, the biggest-selling record on an independent label ever) and the rise to prominence of the Berkeley band Rancid, Dookie spearheaded an interest in American punk rock not seen since the birth of the New York CBGB scene 20 years earlier \u2013 but with the sales to match the cultural impact.\n\u201cWe were always thinking about legacy,\u201d Cool says. \u201cWe never wanted songs to sound like we\u2019d relied too much on whatever recording techniques were in vogue. We knew we were in this for the long haul.\u201d\nThen came, if not decline, then some cooling off. The excellent Insomniac arrived in 1995 and struggled on account of not being Dookie. Nimrod followed in 1997; another strong collection of songs that became most notable for featuring a coda, the purely acoustic \n, that suggested there might be more to Armstrong\u2019s songwriting than three chords and fuzz. The song soundtracked the Seinfeld finale and became a hit at US high school proms, its melancholy dovetailing with events that marked a passing of time. And yet by 2000\u2019s Warning, the mall had been relinquished to the nu-metal kids. Warning became the first release of Green Day\u2019s major-label career not to go multi-platinum. They wouldn\u2019t release an album for another four years.\n\u201cI find it hard between records thinking what I\u2019m going to write about,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cI get a lot of self-doubt. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever realistically thought the band might be done, but I have questioned whether I could do it any more.\u201d\nGreen Day re-emerged amid war in the Middle East under Bush. Young people who might once have been fans were returning in body bags. \u201cSieg heil to the President Gasman,\u201d Armstrong sang on \n from the album American Idiot, and if punks weren\u2019t supposed to sign to major labels, they certainly weren\u2019t supposed to release double albums \n.\nIt sent them stratospheric and the weight of expectation since has never truly lifted: 2009\u2019s 21st Century Breakdown felt ordinary in the shadow of its predecessor; the release of three albums in a year \u2013 2012\u2019s \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos! and \u00a1Tr\u00e9! \u2013 favoured quantity over quality. An ill-fated festival appearance saw Armstrong, his set about to be cut short, destroy his guitar and rant: \u201cI\u2019m not Justin Bieber!\u201d He subsequently went into rehab for the abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.\nThe band slunk into another period of near-irrelevance. They had emerged from the previous one with a genre-defying, generation-defining reboot \u2013 this time all they had was a good record, 2016\u2019s \n. Few bands harness the zeitgeist once, let alone twice. Is Father of All Motherfuckers that third moment? No, but it is the closest they have come since American Idiot. At 26min 16sec, it is their shortest album, featuring a collection of songs as fast and furious as any in their discography. It sounds as if they are having fun for the first time in years, without trying too hard.\nArmstrong says it is an \u201chomage to the roots of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music, the music that inspired us to do this. That doesn\u2019t just mean punk rock. It\u2019s Martha and the Vandellas and Mott the Hoople. Old bubblegum music like the Archies. Powerpop. Garage music \u2026 Playing Motown through Green Day, so to speak.\u201d\nYou might read the fizzing Father of All Motherfuckers as Green Day saying they are not done yet. Ask them if their forthcoming triple-header tour is an attempt to halt a downturn in the band\u2019s fortunes and Armstrong will laugh and say, in reference to 80s-themed package tours: \u201cThere are many differences between Green Day and Kajagoogoo \u2026 We\u2019re going to keep making records that matter. I always want whatever we do to feel like the first time we played at Gilman, or the first time we made a rock opera.\u201d \nBy embracing the band\u2019s love of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, Green Day are also trying to reclaim something at their nation\u2019s core. Instead of an overt appearance from Trump in the lyrics, there is positivity and make-do spirit; it feels like a record about a beloved US, not the US that presently exists. \u201cI think good rock\u2019n\u2019roll has always had this ability to be transcendent,\u201d says Dirnt. \u201cA song might be about losing your gal or whatever other misfortune has come your way \u2026 but the best stuff takes your hand and helps you dance through the apocalypse. I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\nRock as an act of resistance, I offer. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d they all chime. \u201cI like that!\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/ai-in-the-adult-industry-porn-may-soon-feature-people-who-dont-exist": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/ai-in-the-adult-industry-porn-may-soon-feature-people-who-dont-exist", "title": "AI in the adult industry: porn may soon feature people who don't exist", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:00:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Porn has often driven technological innovation, but research into deepfakes raises questions about its potential misuses</p><p>A professional headshot of a man with his face carefully poised in a neutral expression, the kind that might be used in an acting portfolio.

They are the product of an algorithm, a network of images competing against each other to create convincing fakes \u2013 and \n that they could soon replace pictures of real people in everything from the profiles that we match with on dating apps to the bodies that we watch in porn.\nDesigned by former Uber engineer Phil Wang, \n makes use of a code called StyleGAN (short for generative adversarial network). Wang has utilized this code to create a seemingly endless stream of faces.\n\u201cOur sensitivity to faces, when you really think about it, is a product of evolution for successful mating,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat the site really demonstrates is that even for a data distribution that we are so well crafted to understand as human beings, the machine can pick apart all the relevant features and recompose them in a way that\u2019s coherent.\u201d\nWang\u2019s innovation is fascinating and seemingly innocuous and yet it shares the same technological basis as much more sinister creations. Over the past few years GANs have been almost endemically misused to create \n, such as material mapping the faces of celebrities on to existing, often pornographic, footage \u2013 known as deepfakes.\n\u201cA \n found that 96% of all deepfake videos were pornographic and in many cases are being used to harass and terrorize women,\u201d says Rachel Thomas founder of \n and expert in applied data ethics. \u201cIn general, our legal system has been slow to catch up with addressing [this kind of] sexual imagery and the use of AI is deepening and accelerating this problem.\u201d\nWith this technology already inextricably and often problematically \n, some are predicting that even more spurious videos making use of the same fake-face technology might be the next avenue that the adult industry looks to.\nA growing body of research into \n also raises questions about the potential uses and misuses of GANs. In April 2019, a Japanese artificial intelligence company \n that can automatically generate entire bodies in motion. Although they envisaged this being used for advertising, the already disproportionate use of GANs for pornographic purposes means that it isn\u2019t much of a stretch to imagine how this new algorithm might be used in a similar way.\nThe expense and effort involved in creating such footage also means that full-body deepfakes, with real faces or otherwise, are unlikely to replace videos of actual adult performers on a significant scale any time soon, but industry insiders are nevertheless conscious of the potential implications of this technology.\n\u201cMany of the characters in our experiences are CGI generated so [full-body generated deepfakes] are similar to what we do,\u201d says Ela Darling, an adult performer and founder of \n \n, a platform which syncs adult toys to avatars (usually created using real models) to create a hyperrealistic pornographic experience.\n\u201cSome people are concerned that we\u2019re going to reach a place where we don\u2019t even need performers any more, because you can create AI humanoids, and I think that that\u2019s something that could be damaging to performers in the industry.\u201d\nFrom a producer\u2019s point of view, there are many potential benefits to full-body AI generated pornography. It opens up the possibility of experimenting with more innovative and interactive content in an era where free videos have ruptured a previously profitable industry. On the other hand, it makes it easier to create extreme content that consumers seek, but that some performers might not be prepared to participate in. But as with many new technologies, the possibility of creating sexual content featuring people who have never existed still throws up a host of ethical considerations.\nAs debate heightens on how adult content can warp our perception of consensual and enjoyable sex by showing scenes that objectify women and feature problematic sexual activity, and with concerns of \n growing, the idea of introducing life-like images of people who can be bent to the viewer or producer\u2019s will is somewhat worrying. By allowing artificial intelligence into the equation we could be opening up our screens to ever more extreme content, and perhaps making real-life performers feel that they have to compete with their cyber counterparts.\n\u201cThe whole deepfake situation is a deeply unsettling concept because it\u2019s mostly men using women to harm other women,\u201d says Ela Darling, whose site has put strict guidelines in place to ensure that nonconsensual deepfake technology is not used in any of their videos. \u201cWe really focus on the impact of the person being victimized and we don\u2019t consider the deeper power structures being drawn on to create these experiences. As we move into the future and nascent technology becomes more widespread and typical, we need, at the end of the day, to make sure that performers are stakeholders.\u201d\nThe situation is nuanced, and it seems that there is no clear answer on the ethics or desire for AI pornography, or how much closer the technology that Wang showcases on his website brings us towards it. But Wang himself remains positive:\n\u201cI certainly have concerns, but I also think it is better for the majority to be informed of this technology than it is to only have a handful of experts and bad actors make use of it,\u201d he says. \u201cMy goal with the site is modest. I want to share with the world and have them understand instantaneously, what is going on, with just a couple of refreshes.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/06/barrymore-the-body-in-the-pool-review-a-grim-search-for-answers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/06/barrymore-the-body-in-the-pool-review-a-grim-search-for-answers", "title": "Barrymore: The Body in the Pool review \u2013 a grim search for answers", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:50:51 GMT", "summary": "<p>The death of Stuart Lubbock was both a horrendous loss for a young man\u2019s family and a career-ending moment for Michael Barrymore.

Elsewhere, in an eclectic mixed bill, Acosta will perform a duet with Alessandra Ferri by Spanish choreographer Goyo Montero, alongside a world premiere from Brazilian-British choreographer Daniela Cardim and George Balanchine\u2019s Theme and Variations. The festival, which Acosta hopes will help the company \u201cposition ourselves as a brand that can entertain at all levels\u201d, will also include artist Conrad Shawcross\u2019s installation, The Ada Project, \n. \nAn important part of Acosta\u2019s vision for BRB is staging the work of international choreographers unknown in Britain. In the autumn the company will dance the first UK performance of a work by Uwe Scholz, former director of Leipzig Ballet. Scholz\u2019s interpretation of Beethoven\u2019s Seventh Symphony is programmed alongside Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s epic Forgotten Land, set to Britten\u2019s Sinfonia da Requiem. Acosta also plans collaborations beyond the ballet world, including Birmingham organisation \n.\nIn 2021, BRB will perform at London\u2019s Royal Opera House for the first time in 20 years and tour to smaller towns and cities that may not usually see ballet at this level.\nBRB was founded in 1946 as the Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre Ballet, which became the touring arm of the Royal Ballet before the company moved to Birmingham in 1990. David Bintley retired in 2019 after 24 years at the helm. In recent years, the company has been respected for the quality of its work and dancers, but has not always been considered the most artistically exciting troupe.\nOne of the challenges all major companies face is striking the balance between reliable titles such as Swan Lake and new works that don\u2019t always perform well at the box office \u2013 audiences for some shows in Birmingham have been as low as 40% capacity. Acosta aims to bring in wider audiences and take the company out into the community, projecting a trendier, younger image and promising more than 20,000 tickets available for \u00a320 or less.\nHe plans to change the type of ballets the company commissions to reflect 21st-century Britain. \u201cI want to come up with stories that represent Birmingham, a proposition that is completely different to the rest of the companies in the UK. Stories that are not the obvious ones, so people start looking at us in a different light. When you talk about a traditional company, some people might think, \u2018yesterday\u2019. I want people to see us as \u2018now\u2019.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum", "title": "Climate activists bring Trojan horse to British Museum in BP protest", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:28:33 GMT", "summary": "<p>Activists dressed as warriors protest against corporate sponsorship deal with oil firm</p><p>Activists have taken a Trojan horse into the grounds of the British Museum to protest against its sponsorship deal with the oil corporation BP.</p><p>Protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors snuck their 13ft-tall wooden horse through a side gate at 7.30am on Friday and pulled it on to the forecourt in front of the museum\u2019s entrance.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/07/climate-activists-bring-trojan-horse-to-british-museum\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Activists have taken a Trojan horse into the grounds of the \n to protest against its sponsorship deal with the oil corporation BP.\nProtesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors snuck their 13ft-tall wooden horse through a side gate at 7.30am on Friday and pulled it on to the forecourt in front of the museum\u2019s entrance.\nThe installation \u2013 based on the wooden horse in the ancient Greek myth of the siege of Troy \u2013 was timed to coincide with the museum\u2019s latest exhibition, \n, which is described as \u201csupported by BP\u201d.\n\u201cThe Troy exhibition has inspired us to create this magnificent beast, because the Trojan horse is the perfect metaphor for BP sponsorship,\u201d said Helen Glynn, an activist with the theatrical protest group BP or not \n?. \u201cOn its surface the sponsorship looks like a generous gift, but inside lurks death and destruction.\u201d\nThe activists have asked the museum to allow them to keep the wooden horse outside the front door until Saturday, when a bigger demonstration is planned.\nIn a letter handed to the museum, they said: \u201cHundreds of people have helped to crowdfund this horse because they feel so strongly that the museum should not be promoting and giving legitimacy to an oil company when we are in the midst of a climate emergency.\n\u201cThe museum has previously said that it will facilitate peaceful protest and we want to work with you to make sure that our interactive artwork enhances tomorrow\u2019s event.\u201d\nThe museum said it was awaiting advice from the police.\nSaturday\u2019s protests, which organisers say will be one of the biggest so far in the campaign against big oil\u2019s involvement in UK arts, will feature prominent voices from indigenous communities where BP has some of its operations.\nRaki Ap from the Free West Papua Campaign, who will attend the demonstration, said experts \u2013 including UN scientists at the IPCC \u2013 had recognised the key role indigenous communities play in the fight against ecological breakdown.\n\u201cThe most obvious solution to stopping climate change is to protect indigenous peoples and their rights, such as the Papuans in West Papua, where BP\u2019s activities are actively destroying their living environment.\u201d\nThe protest is the latest move in activists\u2019 campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship of the UK\u2019s leading cultural institutions.
