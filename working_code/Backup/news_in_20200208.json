but it is yet to appear. \nHe said on Wednesday that it would be disclosed after the committee, which was disbanded at December's election, is up and running again. \nBut former chair of the committee, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC the reasons for its non-publication are \"entirely bogus\". \nIt was set up in 1994 in order to allow Parliamentarians to scrutinise the work of the UK's security services.\nThe nine-member committee is made up of MPs and peers from different parties - ministers are not allowed to be members.\nUnder the Justice and Security Act 2013, they are allowed to examine the \"expenditure, administration, policy and operations\" of MI6, MI5, GCHQ, and the government.\nIn the last few years, the committee has published reports on issues including the terrorist attacks in 2017 and diversity in the intelligence industry.\nUnlike other committees in Parliament, the prime minister has power over who is a member - although the chair is chosen by members themselves. \nThe decision to start an inquiry into Russian interference in the UK was partly prompted by developments after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.\nThe committee's annual report mentioned the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible interference in the Brexit referendum.\nAfter the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March, the investigation became the \"primary focus\" of the committee in 2018.\nThe report was completed in March 2019, but then had to go through a process of redaction, where the government and security agencies make sure no confidential information is published.Mr Grieve told MPs that this process had finished and the report was sent to the prime minister on 17 October.\nUsually, once a report is signed off, it can be presented to Parliament - and therefore the public. \nDuring a BBC Question Time special in the run-up to the election, Mr Johnson said he saw \"no reason to interfere in the normal timetable for these things just because there's an election going on\". \nHe added that he had seen \"absolutely no evidence\" of interference in \"any British electoral event\". \nMinisters have also argued that it is not unusual for there to be a delay between sign-off and publication, which is why nothing was released before the general election in December.\nNow that a new Parliament has formed, the committee has to be set up from scratch. It is probably only once this has happened that the document can be released.\nWhen pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: \"The report will of course be published...when the Intelligence and Security Committee is reconstituted.\"\nHe went on to accuse SNP MP Owen Thompson, who said the lack of publication so far was unacceptable, of having a \"conspiratorial frame of mind\". \nBut the formation of the new committee is largely the responsibility of the government, which has to consult the leader of the Labour Party regarding its members.\nIt all comes down to how quickly a new committee can be formed. After the 2017 election, it took many months and there is no sign of progress at this stage.\nIt is unclear what - if anything - will come from the publication of the report itself. \nMr Grieve said the document had \"never been marketed by anybody as having smoking gun properties\", making the delay \"all the more mysterious\".\nHe added: \"I would be surprised if we were to see it before Easter\".\nAsked to comment, a UK government spokesperson declined to add anything beyond what Mr Johnson has previously told Parliament. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51413070": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51413070", "title": "Ministers pledge increase in children's cycle training", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 14:23:18 GMT", "summary": "The government is promising to make cycling proficiency lessons available to every child in England.", "story": "The government has pledged to make cycling proficiency lessons available to every child in England.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said an extra 400,000 training places per year would be delivered by a funding boost to the Bikeability programme. \nThe scheme offers more training on roads than the playground-based Cycling Proficiency Test it replaced in 2006.\nCycling UK said the government would not get millions more cycling without infrastructure investment.\nThe Bikeability scheme provides free or subsidised lessons through schools, councils and trainers. \nAccording to the Transport department, the timescale and cost for introducing the extra places has yet to be determined. \nHowever, ministers said spending on cycling and walking schemes had doubled since 2016, and was set to reach \u00a32.4bn. \nAnnouncing the commitment, Cycling Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said ministers wanted to inspire the \"next generation\" of cyclists. \nHe added that a boost in cycling would improve children's mental and physical health, and help the UK meet emissions reduction targets. \nExtending cycle proficiency training to every child was a commitment made by the Conservatives in their manifesto for December's general election. \nLabour also pledged to increase funding available to boost cycling, while the Lib Dems said a tenth of transport spending should go towards cycling and walking. \nCycling UK welcomed the announcement, but said encouraging significant numbers of new cyclists would require major investment.\nThe charity's chief executive Paul Tuohy said: \"We won't get millions more cycling unless there's further significant investment in infrastructure.\n\"Without it, the government is on a highway to failure in getting more people active.\"\nHe added \u00a36-8bn would need to be spent on cycling and walking projects over the next five years if the government's uptake targets are to be met. \nLessons through the Bikeability scheme are available to children in England as soon as they can ride a bicycle without stabilisers. \nSimilar schemes also exist in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

despite having the right to live in the UK for decades. \nThe fallout prompted criticism of the government's \"hostile environment\" approach to immigration and led to the resignation of Amber Rudd as

specifically for removing foreign criminals. \n\"Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing Class-A drugs.\"\nThe spokeswoman added that \"everyone on the flight will have had their cases fully reviewed to ensure there are no outstanding legal barriers, including trafficking and slavery claims, that would prevent their removal from the

It could instead mean it would become a civil offence similar to non-payment of council tax or an electricity bill. \nIn a speech on Wednesday, Baroness Morgan said many people thought it wrong that \"you can be imprisoned for not paying the TV licence and its enforcement punishes the vulnerable\".  \n\"We are launching a public consultation to make sure we have a fair and proportionate approach to licence fee penalties and payments, that protects those most in need in society,\" she added.\nThe culture secretary also announced a new flexible payment scheme, called the Simple Payment Plan, to help those struggling to pay, including the over-75s.\nIt will allow people to spread the fee out into a number of manageable instalments. \n\"This will help prepare the BBC and public service broadcasting for the future and make sure it continues to work for our society, our economy, and the public which funds it,\" said Baroness Morgan. \nLast year, Treasury minister Rishi Sunak said the Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ordered a review of the sanction for non-payment of the \u00a3154.50 charge, which funds the BBC.\nConfirmation of the consultation comes two days after it was announced \nIt also the fee is to increase by \u00a33, from \u00a3154.50 to \u00a3157.50, from 1 April 2020., a decision which saw a number of celebrities joining the call for the decision to be overturned. \nFrom June, only over-75s who are claiming pension credit will be eligible for a free TV licence.\nFormer BBC chairman Lord Grade's urged the government not to \"impoverish and weaken\" the corporation, which he described as the \"corner stone\" of the creative industries in the UK. \nHe said the BBC had \"huge success in promoting the brand of Great Britain around the world\", adding that any plan to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee \"feels like another attempt to impoverish the BBC and weaken it\" and should be \"abandoned immediately\".\nBaroness Morgan said her plans should not be seen as \"any kind of attack on the BBC\".\nThe broadcaster is an \"incredibly important organisation in the UK and around the world\", she said, but added it was the government's \"duty\" to look into the issue of funding.\nIn a statement, the BBC said \"a detailed government-commissioned review (in 2015) found the current system to be the fairest and most effective\". \n\"It did not recommend change - in part because the current system is effective in ensuring payment with very few people ever going to prison. \n\"If there are changes, they must be fair to law abiding licence fee payers and delivered in a way that doesn't fundamentally undermine the BBC's ability to deliver the services they love.\"\nIn 2018, more than 121,000 people were convicted and sentenced for evasion and issued with an average fine of \u00a3176.\nThere were around 26 million TV licences being used in the UK last year, generating \u00a33.69bn in income for the BBC.\nIf decriminalisation of the TV licence fee were to go through, it would have a considerable impact on BBC funding. \nThe DCMS (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) said the government would take into account the impact on the corporation in the context of the overall licence fee settlement, for which negotiations begin later this year. \nA previous government review in 2015 looked into whether a fine for non-payment could be issued under civil law instead, similar to the fees for breaking parking, bus lane and congestion charge rules.\nThe review also examined whether unpaid TV licence fees should be considered a civil debt in the same way as unpaid utility bills or council tax.\nHowever, it recommended against changing the criminal sanctions regime, saying decriminalisation could bring with it an increased risk of evasion. \nA consultation is a process used by public bodies that invites the public to provide their views and feedback on a particular proposal.\nThe members of the public who are asked are individuals and organisations that would be affected directly or indirectly by a project or a decision. \nThey include those who have the ability to influence the decision, both positively and negatively.

a net gain of 320.\nOpening the debate, Tory MP Mike Wood said the pub and beer industries were \"the greatest success stories of the past 20 years\" in UK business, with almost 900,000 jobs depending on them. \nBut he criticised the system of business rates, saying it was a \"basic fairness issue\" when pubs were responsible for 2.8% of all rate revenues collected - despite only accounting for 0.5% of rate-paying businesses.\nMr Wood also said beer duty in the UK \"remains much too high\" - despite government freezes and cuts since 2013.\nTo shouts of \"shame\", he said: \"If you bought a pint in each of the other [main] beer-producing countries - a pint in Germany, a pint in the Netherlands, one in Spain, one in Belgium and one in Poland - you would still have paid less duty on those fives pints than you would have on just a single pint bought in Britain.\"\nOther MPs joined in with stories of pubs and breweries in their constituencies, raising the concerns they have.\nLabour MP Lilian Greenwood praised The Plough in Radford - in her Nottingham South constituency - saying it was a \"nucleus for the local community\". \nBut she said the local Nottingham Brewery, which uses the pub as a tap room, \"worries that if action isn't taken on beer duty... the price of a couple of pints in the pub simply won't be able to compete with the supermarkets much longer\".\nThe SNP's Lisa Cameron called for \"common sense\" when deciding business rates for pubs, saying the Glassford Inn in her constituency of East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow was under threat of closure. \nTory MP Giles Watling reminisced about a \"beautiful pub\" called The Crown, near Stratford-on-Avon, where he had stayed 30 years ago during his previous career as an actor.\n\"I went back after 20 years or so... to the same village. The pub had closed and been developed into housing. I now found this place where people were no longer talking to each other. The heart had been torn out of the community. This village had fundamentally died.\"\nLabour's Bill Esterson raised problems around small brewery tax relief, citing the Neptune brewery in his Sefton Central constituency.\nUnder current rules, if a business produces less than 5,000 hectolitres of beer, it pays 50% of full excise duty - but it must pay the full rate if it makes a drop more.\n\"There is a very strong case for pressure to be put on the Treasury to change those rules and enable those brilliant manufacturers and employers to grow as they wish to,\" said the MP. \nThe SNP's Stephen Flynn warned any reform had to take into account issues with drinking, saying around 22 individuals die every week in Scotland due to alcohol abuse.\nHe added: \"That is a shocking figure that none of us can be happy about, and of course in Scotland we've seen action on that through the introduction of minimum unit pricing which we expect will save 392 lives over just five years.\n\"So when we look at taxation, and we certainly support the reform of beer excise duty, when we look at taxation we need to do so with a holistic view in terms of public health.\"\nTreasury minister Simon Clarke, responding for the government, praised the \"clear consensus\" among MPs, about the \"the centrality of pubs and beer industry and solutions that exist to make sure we help the industry to thrive\".\nBut, he said a cut in alcohol duties would would represent a significant loss in revenues for the Exchequer. \n\"The effective inflation means that in real terms, beer duty is being cut every time we have frozen [it] over the course of the last several years,\" added the minister.\n\"Even in nominal terms, beer duty is now lower than it was in 2012.

We need to keep pushing to get it through Parliament.\"\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb said: \"School uniforms should always be affordable and should not leave pupils or their families feeling that they cannot apply to a particular school.\n\"That is why we will be supporting the progress of this bill through Parliament, in order to make our guidance on the cost considerations for school uniform statutory at the earliest opportunity.\" \nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson tweeted that he was \"delighted\" the government would support the bill, adding: \"Uniforms should always be affordable and should never put families off applying to a particular school.\"\nLast year, a Children's Society survey of 1,000 parents saw nearly one in six families blame uniform costs for having to cut back on food and other basic essentials. \nA joint inquiry by Parliament's education and work and pensions committees last September also heard evidence that schools could cuts costs for parents by choosing to have non-branded uniforms. \nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, low-income families can claim support towards the cost of school uniforms. A similar scheme, based on whether pupils are eligible for free school meals, also exists in Wales. \nMr Amesbury will get the chance to introduce his bill after he topped a ballot allowing MPs to suggest ideas for new laws, known as private members' bills.\nWhile only a small number of these bills have ever become law, some have effected significant change, including the abolition of the death penalty in 1965 and change to the abortion laws in 1967.\nMore recently, a 2019 private member's bill extended the availability of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-51386155": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-51386155", "title": "Tracy Brabin: MP hits back at Twitter 'keyboard warriors'", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 15:13:59 GMT", "summary": "Batley and Spen MP Tracy Brabin said people needed to \"listen to what we say not what we wear\".", "story": "A Labour MP who faced criticism on social media for her off-the-shoulder dress said people needed to \"listen to what we say not what we wear\".\nTracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, said she had been \"startled by the vitriolic nature\" of some comments.\nShe told BBC Breakfast it was her responsibility to \"call it out\".\n\"Women around the world... are being demeaned everyday because of what they wear,\" she said.\nThe Batley and Spen MP had been raising a point of order in the House of Commons on Monday about journalists being asked to leave a Downing Street press briefing on the next stage of Brexit talks, when her shoulder appeared.\nShe said her slightly off-the-shoulder dress had slipped a little as she leant forward to speak.\nMs Brabin said she had been to a music event earlier in the day and was not expecting to be called to the dispatch box.\n\"But, the context of this is frankly pretty absurd,\" she said.\n\"I am here talking about a shoulder when it is an important time for the media,\" she told viewers to BBC Breakfast.\nMs Brabin, who played Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street for three years in the 1990s, said she tried not to take the comments too seriously, especially as they were likely from \"keyboard warriors sat in their mum's back bedroom eating Pot Noodles and having a pop at people they don't know anything about\".\nHowever, she said: \"This is everyday sexism where women are continually judged for what they wear, how they look and not what they say.\"\n\"Why is that?

which are called briefings. \nJournalists walked out of one at Downing Street this week after it's claimed they were put on two sides of the room - with one group asked to leave. \nInstead of letting this happen, all the reporters walked out in solidarity.\nThey have collectively decided not to give long interviews about what happened, but one has told Radio 1 Newsbeat that \"our actions speak for themselves and it's for the government to explain its actions\".\nThe Prime Minister's team deny this is how it happened. \nNewsbeat contacted Downing Street for a comment and was told to watch MPs sitting in the House of Commons when a minister would give the government's version of events. \nThe Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith told MPs that no journalists are barred from official briefings hosted by the Prime Minister's spokesman. \n\"It is entirely standard practice for the government to host additional technical specialist briefings, as was the case,\" she said. \nGovernments of all parties have always given information to parts of the media more likely to give them better coverage. \nHowever, journalists who have reported on politics for years feel we have seen a big shift recently.\nWe've seen lots of stories of how Boris Johnson's close team are preventing ministers from appearing on BBC 2's Newsnight and the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nPresenters on ITV's Good Morning Britain also say they are being ignored and senior ministers have refused to appear on Channel 4 since before the election.\nSome say this a deliberate tactic to avoid scrutiny, something President Trump is accused of in America. \nDonald Trump gave Boris Johnson his backing as Prime Minister at the last election and some journalists, who were at the briefing, say that this event feels like something that could happen under the American leader. \nThere has been a big shift in how any government gets its message to voters and a lot of that is about politicians of all parties using social media to directly connect with its audience.  \nLabour had success with this at the 2017 election. A strong social media strategy is central to modern politics. \nBoris Johnson faces questions once a week from MPs at Prime Minister's Questions - or PMQs for short - in the House of Commons. \nIt's an event loved by Westminster geeks but not that popular with the rest of the country. \nBoris Johnson and his team have started an event to follow it called People's PMQs where he answers questions sent in on Facebook. \nThe government say this is about answering questions that matter to voters, but critics say the questions are selected by his team and can be quite easy to answer. \nWe mentioned that Labour under Jeremy Corbyn has been seen as good at using social media but it has also been criticised for how it deals with the big media organisations. \nSome political observers say the party's leader has been reluctant to appear on mainstream media outlets. \nSo when Labour's spokesperson on the media, said the government was behaving like President Trump critics of Jeremy Corbyn were quick to highlight what they see as inconsistency. \nWe asked Labour for an official comment and so far they've not given us one.\nSome will say this is all a bit inward-looking and it's just big, established media organisations getting angry and feeling left out.   \nThere could be truth in that but others say this is a big issue because how the country works relies on the government being held to account and being scrutinised.\nCurrently the main opposition party Labour are in a weak position. They lost the recent election and are a long way from power. \nCritics of the government will be hoping the media is able to do a lot of the questioning instead and anything that pushes the press out prevents this. \nThe Prime Minister's team insist it is open to scrutiny.

They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. \nBut that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. \nTerms and conditions always apply and the EU says it has two main conditions.\nFirst and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. \nThese are known as level-playing-field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.  \nMost importantly, its draft negotiating mandate says a future partnership must \"ensure the application\" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. \nThe UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights. \nBut Boris Johnson has publicly ruled out any such commitment and said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. \n\"There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,\" Mr Johnson said in his speech in London.\nHe also pointed out the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.  \nThe EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada. \nThe UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference. But if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. \nEither way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January. \nHis critics accuse him of recklessness but the prime minister says he has \"no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper\".\nThe EU's second condition is a free-trade deal must include an agreement on fisheries - because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. \nThe UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\". \nThe EU sees things rather differently.\nIts draft mandate says a future deal should \"aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters\".\nThat's a lot of access and the EU seems prepared to link it to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.  \nFishing is a tiny part of the UK economy - well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.  \nWhen it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is more flexible. \n\"We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,\" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. \n\"What I am looking for is consistency.\"\nThe UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. \nThe more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. \nThat's true for both goods and services. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. \nInstead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. \nBut talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. \nIt doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.\nThis is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.   \nMr Johnson said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.  \nGaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. \nNow, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free trade agreement. \nIt wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they \"raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law\".\nBut the government's written statement says a future agreement cannot include \"any jurisdiction for the [ECJ] over the UK's laws\".\nThe ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.\nBut a future trade deal is a different matter. \nDevising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. \nIt's not just about trade, it's about internal security cooperation and access to databases too. \n\"Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,\" Michel Barnier said, \"obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full.\"\nThe EU's draft mandate also says there should be \"automatic termination\" of law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order \"must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way\". \nSo there are some big divides to be bridged. \nBoth sides say they would settle for a free-trade agreement but they have to work out how to get there and how to implement it.  \nIt is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. \nThere is a long way to go in a short period of time. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772", "title": "What is climate change?

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

Ceta does not do that.\nCeta gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs (that's taxes on imports) on goods traded between the EU and Canada. Tariffs remain on poultry, meat and eggs.\nIt also increases quotas (that's the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges) but does not get rid of them altogether. For example, quotas on EU cheese exports to Canada increase from 18,500 tonnes to 31,972 tonnes a year.\nIt does little for the trade in services and in particular almost nothing for the trade in financial services, which is very important for the UK economy.\nIt also does not remove border checks, so there is still a possibility that goods have to be examined at ports to make sure they meet regulatory requirements, and their paperwork is in order.\nCeta protects EU \"geographical indications\", meaning for example that you can only make Parma ham in Italy and camembert cheese in France, and Canada can't import something that calls itself camembert from any other country.\nThey have also agreed to open up government contracts to each other, so Canadian companies could bid to build French railways, for example.\nThere is also co-operation between the two countries on standards, so a piece of equipment made in an EU country can go through all its safety and quality checks there, without needing to have them repeated in Canada - and vice versa.\nCeta also allows professional qualifications to be recognised both in Canada and the EU, making it easier, for example, for architects or accountants to work in both places.\nAnd it aligns Canadian rules in some areas of copyright and patents with those of the EU.  \nCountries that are closer to each other tend to trade more, especially in goods, and this is the case with the UK and the EU.\nThe UK exported \u00a3291bn of goods and services to other EU countries in 2018, which was 45% of all UK exports.\nIt imported \u00a3357bn of goods and services from the EU, which was 53% of all UK imports.\nOn the other hand, Canada exported 46.2bn Canadian dollars (\u00a326.7bn) of goods and services to the EU in 2017, which was 7.9% of its exports.\nIt imported 63.6bn Canadian dollars of goods and services to the EU, which was 10.5% of its imports. \nThe prime minister also mentioned having an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's.\nThe EU does not have a free trade deal with Australia. They are in negotiations for one, but they currently operate mainly on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\nThere was an EU-Australia Partnership Framework agreed in 2008, which reduces barriers to trade, but was not a free trade agreement.\nSo, trading on a similar basis to Australia would be largely the same as trading under WTO rules. In other words, it's another way of saying the UK would leave with no trade deal in place. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987", "title": "Brexit: Five things the UK needs to resolve after leaving the EU", "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:01:52 GMT", "summary": "Why food, trade and security are some of the key challenges for post-Brexit Britain.", "story": "The UK might have left the EU but many questions remain unanswered. \nHere are just some of the hurdles facing the UK after Brexit.\nThis legal departure from the EU means the UK can finally start formal trade negotiations - both with the EU and countries around the world, like the US. \nThe government is determined not to extend the post-Brexit transition period - to discuss the future relationship with the EU - beyond the end of 2020. This means the timetable for getting an agreement with the EU is extremely tight. \nFormal talks are expected to begin in March, once the remaining 27 EU countries have agreed on instructions for their negotiators. \nGetting any agreement finally signed off and put into practice will take a couple of months towards the end of the year. So, realistically, that only leaves time for a fairly basic free trade deal to emerge, with plenty of issues still up for discussion once the transition period is over. accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs.% of total UK trade in 2018\nThe government talks about getting a \"zero tariff, zero quota\" deal on goods, with no border taxes and no limits on exports and imports. \nBut there are a host of issues to be dealt with if the aim is to keep trade flowing as smoothly as possible, and that is before we mention the services sector. \nFrom financial and business services to the food and drinks industry, this \nIt is of course in the interest of both sides to get a deal done, but it remains a massive task. Expect disputes about fisheries, fair competition, the role of the European Court of Justice and more.\nIt is possible that no deal will be done in time, which will generate a fresh crisis in UK/EU relations as 2020 draws to a close.    \nIf the challenge to get a trade deal within 11 months is not hard enough, the UK must also agree a treaty to paper over legal cracks in the way countries work together on security.\nPolicing and security experts in the UK and the EU agree that things will become harder after Brexit.\nFor instance, the UK no longer has a place on the team that manages Europol, the agency that co-ordinates major investigations into Europe-wide organised crime. \nThis means the UK's priorities - such as concerns about smuggling people or arms across the English Channel - may, slowly, fall down the pecking order. \nBritish police officers can, for now, still use EU systems to check criminal records of foreign nationals, or alerts on wanted people from around the continent. \nBut access to that information could either end or become harder, because many member states have their own specific laws governing data-sharing beyond the EU. \nThe government is trying to think ahead. \nIt has, for instance, pledged to pass laws to ensure the same fast service the UK has enjoyed from the European Arrest Warrant - which allows suspects to be sent to another country for trial - if a deal cannot be struck. Everyone, on both sides, wants that. \nThe question is whether it is legally doable - and if so, can it be done by January 2021?\nFrom farming and fishing to manufacturing and retail, the UK's food and drink sector adds \u00a3460bn to the UK economy every year, employing more than four million people. \nIt represents a fifth of UK manufacturing, by far the biggest chunk of the sector. \nSo there is some nervousness about what will happen to the complicated way that food and drink makes its way to consumers after the end of the transition period. \nA third of people in the industry are from outside the UK, with many from Eastern Europe. What happens if the number of such workers is restricted because of the introduction of a minimum salary being imposed for migrants? \nWhen it comes to trade, there is the prospect products may have to be opened and checked at borders which could add expense and cut the shelf life of fresh food. \nAnd the Food and Drink Federation, a body representing food manufacturers, says the most complex challenge is around trying to get a trade deal with Europe that satisfies what are called \"rules of origin\". \nUK manufacturers use a mixture of domestic and internationally-produced ingredients, which would not be allowed under rules included in recent EU trade deals.\nThe government has a huge task ahead to establish the UK's place in the world after leaving the EU. \nMinisters have to work out what the government's slogan \"Global Britain\" actually means. \nThe traditional role of providing a transatlantic bridge between Europe and the US will be put to one side. \nInstead, ministers must develop a more independent foreign policy. That could mean less automatic support from the UK for the US, as it focuses more on domestic issues and less on its relations with other countries.\nIt will mean a new relationship with European allies, not through EU structures, but through smaller existing groups. These include the E3, an informal group made up of the UK, Germany and France, which has worked together on issues like relations with Iran. \nThe biggest foreign policy challenge will be how to navigate a path between an increasingly stronger China and a defensive US, without the protective membership of the EU. \nTo that end, Boris Johnson has ordered what he calls an 'integrated review\" of the UK's security, defence and foreign policy which is expected to report later this year. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe protesters who turn up on Westminster's College Green are a lonely bunch these days. \nEven the most ardent fan of the EU would have to admit that the heat has gone out of the passionate, and often vicious, political fight of the last few years. \nThe challenge for Mr Johnson is now to show to the public that all the disruption, all the arguing, was actually worth it. \nThat will not be easy. Brexiteers are keen to make the most of the powers that will come back to the UK from Brussels as soon as possible. \nBut now we are in the departure lounge - the transition period where the status quo will stay pretty much the same. \nEven if you popped champagne on Friday night to celebrate the UK leaving the EU, when you woke up on Saturday morning not much would have actually felt very different. \nCan the enthusiasm and excitement on that side be managed?\nAnd even though the stay or leave debate is now at an end, some voters still believe we are setting off on a path of folly.

This gave the Leave side 52%, compared with 48% for Remain. \nThe EU is an economic and political union involving 28 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. \nThe UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and it will be the first member state to withdraw. \nAfter the UK formally leaves the EU on 31 January 2020, there is still a lot to talk about and months of negotiation will follow.\nWhile the UK has agreed the terms of its EU departure, both sides still need to decide what their future relationship will look like.This will be worked out during the transition period (which some prefer to call the implementation period), which begins immediately after Brexit day and is due to end on 31 December 2020.\nDuring this 11-month period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. \nThe transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while a new free trade agreement is negotiated. \nThis is needed because the UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of the transition. A free trade agreement will allow goods to move around the EU without checks or extra charges.\nIf a new one cannot be agreed in time, then the UK faces the prospect of having to trade with no deal in place. That would mean tariffs (taxes) on UK goods travelling to the EU and other trade barriers.\nAside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will also need to be decided. For example:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists the transition period will not be extended, but the European Commission has warned that the timetable will be extremely challenging.\nThe transition period and other aspects of the UK's departure were agreed in a separate deal called the withdrawal agreement.\nMost of that was negotiated by Theresa May's government. But after Mr Johnson replaced her in July 2019, he removed the most controversial part - the backstop. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe backstop was designed to ensure there would be no border posts or barriers between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. If needed, it would have kept the UK in a close trading relationship with the EU.\nUnder Mr Johnson's deal, a customs border will effectively be created between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

According to these polls, most Remain (88%) and Leave voters (86%) would vote the same way as in the 2016 referendum. However, those who did not vote in 2016 back Remain by two to one (53% to 26%).\nOne poll conducted since the election, by BMG Research, suggests opinion has not shifted significantly since the election. It put Remain on 52% and Leave on 48%. \nThe lead for Remain is too small to be certain that most voters would prefer Brexit was not happening. However, the evidence certainly does suggest the UK remains more or less evenly divided about Brexit.\nTwo key issues in the 2016 referendum were immigration and the economy. In both cases, Remain and Leave voters still have very different views about what Brexit will mean.\nAccording to research by NatCen, nearly two in five of all voters (38%) think immigration will fall. Just 7% believe it will increase after the UK leaves the EU.\nHowever, nearly half (46%) of those who voted Leave believe immigration will be lower, compared with only 34% of Remain supporters.\nThese figures have not changed much since the EU referendum.\nIn contrast, attitudes towards the economic consequences of leaving the EU have shifted. In September 2016, a few months after the EU referendum, under half (45%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit, while 30% believed it would be better.\nBut in a survey by NatCen during the election campaign, over half (56%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit. Fewer than a quarter (21%) believed it would be better. \nHowever, those who voted Leave are still more likely to say that the economy will be better off (46%) than worse off (21%). In contrast, as many as 84% of Remain supporters believe the economy will be worse off.\nImmigration and the economy will also be important in forthcoming talks about the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will have to decide what rules on immigration it wants and how much it wishes to depart from rules governing what can be bought and sold in the EU. \nConcern about immigration has fallen during the last three years. However, most voters reject current rules which mean anyone from the EU can live and work in the UK, but people from outside the EU must apply to do so.\nDuring the election, nearly three in five (58%) voters told NatCen that EU residents should also have to apply to live and work in the UK. Less than a quarter (22%) said they were against the idea. \nEven among those who voted Remain, nearly half (47%) said they were in favour of this approach.\nIt is figures like these that help explain why the government wants to end freedom of movement.\nMost voters seem keen to keep close economic ties with the EU.\nNo fewer than 86% agree that after Brexit, companies based in the EU should be allowed \"to sell goods and services freely in Britain in return for allowing British companies to sell goods and services freely in the EU\".\nTo realise that ambition, it is likely that the regulations on what can be made and sold in the UK will have to remain fairly similar to those in the EU.\nVoters are not always opposed to keeping to EU rules, particularly when those rules might be thought to favour consumers.\nEven after Brexit, NatCen's research found nearly three-quarters (72%) want UK companies to follow EU rules limiting the cost of using a mobile phone abroad. \nSimilarly, almost four in five (78%), think UK airlines should still follow EU rules requiring them to compensate seriously-delayed passengers.\nAs the UK government seeks the freedom to do things differently, it might well consider that voters could want some things to remain the same - particularly when it comes to their rights as consumers.\nThis analysis piece was More from Sir John Curtice is professor of politics, Strathclyde University, and senior research fellow at commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. and \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714", "title": "Sweets and football: How the UK celebrated joining Europe", "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:20:26 GMT", "summary": "A look at the 11-day \"Fanfare for Europe\" that followed British entry into the EEC in 1973.", "story": "A light show in Downing Street and a new 50p coin will be among official events marking Brexit on Friday. \nDespite some accusations of triumphalism, the tone marks a more muted contrast with British entry into the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. \nA new 50p was also minted back then - featuring nine interlocking hands to reflect the newly-expanded membership of the club. \nBut Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath went further, and organised 11 days of government-subsidised cultural events. \nBeginning three days after entry on 1 January, the \"Fanfare for Europe\" featured hundreds of musical, artistic, and sporting events. \nAs with Brexit in 2020, the occasion was not immune from political wrangling. \nMr Heath, a Europhile who had long dreamed of witnessing British entry into the EEC, known as the Common Market, took an active role in certain events. \nHe attended a special gala at the Royal Opera House, and personally presented prizes to British and EEC children who won free holidays in an essay competition.\nHe also brought down the starting flag on a rally of dozens of vintage cars from London to Brussels.\nThe decision to put himself at the centre of events did not come without risks, however, as some events saw protests from anti-market protestors. \nIn fact, the prime minister was stink-bombed as he arrived for the gala in Covent Garden alongside the Queen. \nIn total, seven government departments and two specially-created temporary committees were involved in devising the programme for the Fanfare.\nCrossbench peer and Arts Council chairman Lord Goodman led a committee responsible for cultural events - while a second committee, chaired by the Conservative peer Lord Mancroft, took the lead in other fields. \nCultural events dominated the schedule, with 25 art exhibitions on European themes arranged, as well as scores of concerts. \nThe Berlin Philharmonic were brought over for special concert, whilst groups such as the Kinks, Steeleye Span and Slade all had gigs. \nAt the Victoria and Albert Museum, an exhibition was put together featuring artwork loaned especially by each of the six existing EEC members. \nDenmark sent two Bronze Age wind instruments, while the Italian donation, a bust of Brutus by Michelangelo, was described in the programme as a \"highly expressive tribute to the fight against tyranny\".\nMeanwhile France, which had twice vetoed British entry into the EEC in the 1960s, sent a 17th Century depiction of card cheating by painter Georges de la Tour. \nHowever an attempt to bring the Mona Lisa to London reportedly failed when a request to send the Rosetta Stone to the Louvre in exchange was turned down. \nAmong the headline events was a special football match at Wembley, which pitted players from the six existing EEC countries against a team composed of players from the UK, Ireland and Denmark, who joined together in 1973. \nThe 'Three', selected by England World Cup-winning manager Sir Alf Ramsey, ran out 2-0 victors with goals from Danish international Henning Jensen and Coventry City striker Colin Stein.\nAmong the British stars who featured were England's Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton, and Scottish international Peter Lorimer. \nGerman international Franz Beckenbauer also took part, although he was taken off at half-time. \nDespite the star appearances, however, ticket sales were slow and only 36,500 fans turned up, not much more than a third of Wembley's capacity at that time.\nLack of enthusiasm did not stop there, with Lord Mancroft admitting to the Times three months before events began that some councils had refused to take part.\n\"But we found a much greater number, who, while not being very enthusiastic, have accepted that British entry is going to happen and are prepared to join us and do their best,\" he added. \nTaxpayer support of \u00a3350,000 - around \u00a34.2m in today's terms - also proved contentious, despite protestations from Lord Goodman to MPs scrutinising expenditure that it was a \"trivial sum of money for this festival\".\nLabour leader Harold Wilson - who had opposed the Conservative deal taking the UK into the EEC - called government subsidies \"an outrage\".\nHe suggested that instead of the festivities, it would have been more appropriate to give all British workers a bank holiday. \nApart from in Scotland, the UK was the only EEC country not to offer its workers time off on New Year's Day at the time it joined - but the first day of the year had long been marked by widespread absenteeism in certain sectors. \nPerhaps recognising the inevitable, Ford and British Leyland were among the firms that voluntarily gave staff that day off in 1973. \nNew Year's Day became a UK-wide bank holiday in 1974. \nEdward Heath also had to fend off accusations that the Fanfare was a propaganda exercise, dominated by highbrow events concentrated in London.\nThings were hardly helped by the timing of Britain's EEC entry, which took place in the midst of a government-imposed pay freeze to control inflation. \nJim Callaghan, a future Labour PM then serving as the party's shadow foreign secretary, made the link when the issue was debated in the Commons. \n\"It might be thought that because the government cannot give the people bread, they are giving them circuses,\" he quipped. \nDespite the differences with today's circumstances, Brexit has bridged the decades with the Fanfare in one respect - with the revival of one element of the EEC festivities that went rather awry back in 1973. \nA 1973 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, entitled \"Sweets\", was brought to an abrupt end on its final day when the display of European confectionary was devoured by schoolchildren who had overwhelmed a guard. \nThe exhibition was recreated to coincide with the expected date of the UK's exit in March last year, alongside a specially-commissioned film from German artist Ulla von Brandenburg. \nAhead of its opening, she told the gallery the exhibition offered the chance to reflect on both the political and culinary tastes of the two periods. \n\"What is funny is that a lot of sweets didn't change,\" she said at the time. \n\"The world has changed a lot since 1973, but not the sweets.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028", "title": "Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 11:52:43 GMT", "summary": "The rise of Euroscepticism - a political creed for so long ignored or ridiculed by the Westminster establishment.", "story": "It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream. \nSo how did Euroscepticism conquer Britain?\nThe word \"Eurosceptic\" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades.\nBritain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out.\nThey rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics.\nIt was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined.\nWith World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe.\nHis, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time.\nMany in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail.\nMost opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. \n\"I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,\" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee.\nThe first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. \nIt had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall.\nEuroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter.\nMaj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Party after being slow-handclapped at the party's conference, believed joining the \"protectionist\" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty.\nHis Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. \nOn 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt. Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided over Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum.\nThere was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum.\nThe vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. \nSome polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. \nWhatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. \nLabour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins.\nMargaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit.\nShe had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a \"social Europe\", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency.\nIt all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975.\nBritain's \"destiny is in Europe\", she stressed, but added: \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.\"\nIt was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier.\nWhich brings us to...\nIn 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: \"We are all Europeans now.\"\nIn November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - \"Up, Yours Delors\", said the headline - to \"tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU\" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro).\nThe rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics.\nIt began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to \"prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate\".\nThe tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to \"ever closer union\" and the free movement of people.\nThe League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact.\nMr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists.\nConservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. \nBut even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about \"reform\" or, if they were in a daring mood, \"fundamental reform\".\nThe mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe.\nHe spent more than \u00a37m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. \nIn many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament.\nUKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. \n\"Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,\" Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week.\n\"It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,\" he added, and UKIP used the \"wherewithal\" provided by the Brussels parliament to \"build a UK political movement\".\nThe same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. \nUKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it.\nA household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column.\nMr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map.\nIt's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's \"People's Army\".\nIn 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them \"extremists\" and \"cranks\".\nTwo years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry.\nSome 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. \nMr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron would announce plans for a referendum just under two years later.\nNigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy.\nUKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. \nThen Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. \nDavid Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party.\nBut he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters.\nIts recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment. Euroscepticism had finally shaken off its reputation as an eccentric fringe movement. \nRecalling UKIP's early days in the European Parliament in 1999, at a farewell press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Farage said: \"We were considered pretty odd. Perhaps we were, I don't know, certainly very eccentric.\n\"And as those years went by I did begin to wonder whether I might become the patron saint of lost causes.\"\nBut now, he added, \"far from being a minority sport, Euroscepticism had become the mainstream, settled view in the United Kingdom\".\n"}}, "business": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51417469": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51417469", "title": "Women hold third of board roles at FTSE 100 firms", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 02:21:34 GMT", "summary": "Boards of big companies have achieved the target almost a year early, say ministers.", "story": "One in three board positions at the UK's biggest companies is now held by a woman, a government-backed review has found.\nThe Hampton-Alexander Review latest report found 349 women currently sit on boards at FTSE 100 firms.\nThe government said the review's \"fantastic work\" had seen it hit the target almost a year early.\nBut the review also highlighted a lack of women in senior and executive roles - making up 15% of finance directors.\nThat compared with women making up 66% of human resource directors, the report said.\nThe review's chief executive, Denise Wilson, told the BBC that problems such as unconscious bias and gender stereotypes around what a leader should look like were preventing further progress.\n\"I think 33% is a very good start, but as we can see, we have a lot further to go before we see a good gender balance in the leadership of British business,\" she said. \nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom said that businesses had achieved the one in three target voluntarily and without the need for legislation or fines but called on firms to do more.\n\"The Hampton-Alexander Review has done fantastic work but it's clear that women continue to face barriers to success, whether that's through promotion to key roles or how they are treated by colleagues,\" she added.\nThe Institute of Directors welcomed the report as evidence that focusing the spotlight on diversity could change the behaviour of big companies.

The rise in the FTSE 250 was from 9% to 22%, still lagging the 33% target.\nIts successor, the Hampton-Alexander Review, encourages FTSE 350 companies to meet a 33% target by the end of 2020.

But if there is a significant change to the original arrangements, you don't have to accept and can ask for a full refund instead.\nKuoni Travel told us it was reviewing the situation daily and was contacting people who have bought holidays in China up until the end of April to discuss their options.\nBritish Airways will change or refund bookings to China and Hong Kong up until 29 February, while Virgin Atlantic flights to Shanghai are suspended until 29 March.\nYes, if you are in a country and while you are there the Foreign Office decides to advise against visiting except for essential travel, you should be able to make a \"curtailment\" claim on your policy. You would be able to claim for unused travel and accommodation and reasonable expenses for returning home.\nYou should ask the airline or tour operator to transfer you to an alternative route. If the airline or travel agent charges a fee to amend the flight then a travel insurance policy could come in handy because it may cover the extra charges or the overall cost of cancellation. \nCruise ships are refusing to take passengers who have passed through China, Hong Kong or Macau 14 days before embarkation.

If those companies can find colleges or training firms with existing contracts and spare places, they can take on more apprentices. \nBut Mr Daniels cannot do that. The course he needs is much too specialised.\nHis problem is part of a much bigger story. New apprenticeship rules introduced in 2017 see big businesses pay a levy, some of which is shared with smaller firms. \nMany big companies are investing more in their staff, but that means there is less money left over for apprenticeships elsewhere. \nWith apprenticeships costing more than expected, in the words of the National Audit Office, \"there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the programme\". That is an auditor's way of warning the money could run out. \nSince the reforms, the number of new apprenticeships in England has dropped.\nMark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, says: \"What we have done is create a system that has removed the very apprenticeships that are needed.\" \nMeanwhile, English further education colleges that deliver much of this training struggle to recruit after years of low funding. \nCroydon College's principal Caireen Mitchell says: \"We're having more and more problems recruiting specific areas such as plumbing and engineering, or even health and care, because the comparative wages are so low.\"\nIf further education colleges got the same attention as sandstone ones at ancient universities, this would be a bigger row.\nSo what changes now, those in the training industry ask, with a government that has promised to \"level up\" and create a high-skill economy?\nThey say that a little louder now with a Budget on the way. \nPeople are lobbying hard to get a little more cash from an administration that has pledged a \u00a33bn skills fund. Take the complaints of colleges and the training industry at face value though, and much of the \u00a33bn could be needed just to shore up the current system. \nSources say budget negotiations are still going on. But many in government are hopeful that there will be more money for further education. \n\"There is massive will behind this,\" says one. \nThe appointment of a prominent supporter of further education - crossbench peer Alison Wolf - as a Number 10 advisor is significant.\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"The apprentice levy means more money is available than ever before for employers of all sizes to invest in training and this year we have increased investment to over \u00a32.5bn, double what was spent in 2010-11 in cash terms.\"\nMeanwhile in Hull, sixty-something trainee docker Gerry Thompson is full of faith in apprenticeships.\nHe says: \"There's always jobs on the docks for everybody.

The prize money varies depending on the amount of weight a person has to lose.\nSomeone who wanted to lose a small amount of weight could bet \u00a3300 in total over 10 months, but make just \u00a333 if they succeeded. If they didn't hit their goal, they would lose all of their money.\nPeople who want to lose more win greater returns, assuming they achieve their stated goal.\n\"We've had about \u00a3250,000 of contracts in the UK in the first month of the year,\" said Mr Roddenbury. \nHe added: \"About one third of our participants accomplish their goal and get a prize at the end.\"\nDietBet, the company that Faith signed up to, say that about 50% of customers win their four-week bets. It did not however provide data for those signing up to longer, more expensive bets.\n\"I am quite a competitive person and the idea I could actually make money by losing weight really appealed,\" says Faith.\n\"A friend of mine set up a DietBet group. Everybody who took part put in $20 (\u00a315.46), because it's a US company. \n\"The aim was to lose 4% of your body weight within four weeks and whoever managed to achieve that target would share out the money at the end.\"\nDietBet's participants pool their money and the company takes a slice of that cash. If everyone wins, it foregoes its share so that no one gets less back than they put in.\n\"We got sent vaguely encouraging messages over the four weeks and there was a certain amount of chat among the group,\" says Faith.\n\"I had a bit of a panic at the end about whether I had actually done enough to win my bet. But actually, I lost a few pounds more than needed,\" she adds.\n\"Unfortunately, we must have been a really motivated group because it turned out everyone had won their bets. \n\"So I just got my $20 back. In fact, with the exchange rate I think I got slightly less back than I had put in at the beginning. But I had lost the weight and I think it did encourage me.\"\nOn the surface, this looks like one way tech firms are trying to disrupt an existing market - weight loss is big business in the UK.\nHowever, there are real concerns that because it is online and competitive, weight loss wagers could enable unhealthy and even dangerous behaviours. \nA spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association (BDA) told the BBC: \"The fact that they 'gamify' weight loss and add a competitive element to losing weight would be hugely detrimental to those with poor relationships with food. \n\"Those with eating disorders could use a website such as this to justify dieting and restriction for monetary gain. That could have significant impacts on both mental and physical health.\"\nThe eating disorder charity Beat says it is very worried about the potential impact of these wager websites.\n\"The evidence is pretty clear that fitness wagers, fitness apps, anything where the individuals are able to track their weight loss and use that in a competitive or a 'gamification' way is extremely dangerous for people with eating disorders,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"It's been shown to exacerbate their eating disorder behaviours and make recovery much harder.\"\nDifferent companies have different ways to stop people participating if they cannot do so safely. Those include \"flagging systems\" and referees, but none of them are fail-safe.\nAmanda Avery, an obesity specialist dietician and chair of the BDA's Obesity Specialist Group, said that motivation can often help with weight loss, though.\n\"But there are more accessible motivators. Somebody could put a pound in a pot for every pound they lose and then save up and buy themselves a nice new outfit or something.\n\"If they could find some support whereby their diet improves, they manage to increase their physical activity levels, they are going to be much more likely to maintain any weight loss they achieve.\"\nFor Faith, making a wager was simply an extra incentive. But she does acknowledge that a larger or longer wager than hers might have been an issue.\nShe said: \"I think with any process where you are being weighed, there's a danger that people might take it to extremes or not follow a healthy eating plan. But that applies whether it's a bet or a slimming club where you show up in person.\n\"There were bets on offer where you had to put in a significantly larger amount of money for longer periods of time. I was a bit more wary of that.\"\n\"Wagered\" weight loss worked for Faith, but did it last?\n\"Sadly no,\" she says. \"But I kept it off for a few months.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935", "title": "Poorer households may get help on energy bills", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:06 GMT", "summary": "The burden of paying for clean energy technology could be shifted to the tax payer.", "story": "Households struggling with energy bills may get help from a government review of clean technology funding.\nAt the moment, an annual levy is imposed on gas and electricity bills to fund renewables such as offshore wind.\nThe burden falls disproportionately on the poorest in society, and it will get worse as the UK expands clean energy to tackle climate change.\nThe BBC has been told the government may shift the cost onto tax payers to avoid anger at climate policies.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are definitely considering the way that costs are distributed.\"\nCurrently about \u00a310bn a year is being invested to support clean technology.

The industry is trying to figure out what to do with them.", "story": "Welcome to the wind turbine graveyard. It stretches a hundred metres from a bend in the North Platte River in Casper, Wyoming.\nBetween last September and this March, it will become the final resting place for 1,000 fibreglass turbine blades.\nThese blades, which have reached the end of their 25-year working lives, come from three wind farms in the north-western US state. Each is about 90m (300ft) long, and will be cut into three, then the pieces will be stacked and buried.\nTurbines from the first great 1990s wave of wind power are reaching the end of their life expectancy today. About two gigawatts worth of turbines will be refitted in 2019 and 2020. And disposing of them in an environmentally-friendly way is a growing problem.\nBurying them doesn't sound very green. Can they not be recycled?\nWind power goes as far back at least as 9th Century BC Persia, where sails were used to grind grain and draw up water on the windy Sistan plains.\nScottish professor James Blyth built the first windmill to make electricity in 1887, powering his holiday home in Marykirk.\nHis second powered the Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary in Montrose (later Sunnyside Royal Hospital).\nInstead of using cloth to catch the wind like Prof Blyth and the ancient Iranians, today's turbine blades are built from composite materials - older blades from glass fibre, newer ones from carbon fibre.\nSuch composite materials might be light and strong, but they are also extremely hard to recycle.\nThat doesn't mean they have to go into landfill, according to Don Lilly, chief executive of Global Fiberglass Solutions in Bellevue, Washington.\nMr Lilly has been transforming fibreglass composites into small pellets he calls EcoPoly.\nThe pellets can then be turned into injectable plastics, or highly waterproof boards that can be used in construction, he says.\nMr Lilly has received interest from \"several manufacturers\" for his pellets.\nHe's also developed a programme to track blades throughout their life cycle, and make it easier to recycle them at the end.\nIf we \"holistically think about the end of life, there are simple choices we could make now that could make fibreglass in the blade easier to recycle,\" says Richard Cochrane, professor of renewable energy at Exeter University.\nA second avenue for recycling turbine blades is called pyrolysis.\nAfter first chopping up the blades, pyrolysis breaks up the composite fibres in ovens with an inert atmosphere, at about 450-700C.\nThe process recovers fibres other industries can reuse for glues, paints, and concrete.\nOther products include syngas (synthesis gas) that can be used in combustion engines. And char (charcoal) which can be used as a fertiliser.\nThe problem is significant amounts of energy are needed to activate the pyrolysis, which might limit its environmental usefulness. It has mainly been done at a laboratory scale. Germany's subsidiary of the French recycling group Veolia is researching the technology.\nIn Rotterdam unwanted blades have been put to a different use. The Dutch city boasts a 1,200sq m children's playground called Wikado, with a slide tower, tunnels, ramps, and slides all made from five discarded wind turbine blades.\nDecommissioned blades have also been turned into another playground and outdoor seats in the Dutch city of Terneuzen, two bus stops in Almere, a seat beside Rotterdam's famous Erasmusbrug bridge.\nC\u00e9sare Peeren, an architect from Rotterdam's Superuse Studios is currently waiting for planning permission to turn two 55m blades into a bridge in Denmark's city of \u00c5lborg, he says.\nMeanwhile new rotors are only getting bigger.\n\"Twenty years ago, my colleagues and I used to ask ourselves what is the most powerful offshore wind turbine that we could imagine,\" says Vincent Schellings, who works for General Electric in the Dutch city of Enschede.\n\"We couldn't picture anything much more powerful than a three megawatt (MW) output, but even that seemed a challenge,\" he says.\nMr Schellings recently led the development team for GE's Haliade-X, now the world's largest wind turbine.\nIt produces 12MW - four times the amount he imagined 20 years ago. Its 107m blades yield 45% more energy than previous offshore turbines.\n\"So we are going to see much bigger turbines offshore in this decade, and the reason is size matters,\" says Rolf Kragelund, Danish-based director of offshore wind for the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.\nBigger onshore turbines can access faster wind speeds, higher in the sky. They can produce more energy, meaning you need fewer of them, which saves money on transport, installation and servicing. \nSiemens Gamesa says 20 of its new 10MW turbines, announced last year with 94m blades, could power Liverpool, with a population of half a million.\nBut large turbines bring along their own challenges, including what to do with them when they are no longer needed.\nBigger blades \"need bigger factories, bigger vessels, cables, foundations, and handling equipment,\" says Ray Thompson, global business development head at Spanish-headquartered Siemens Gamesa, one of the world's two largest wind turbine makers.\nLonger blades can make for bigger recycling headaches, too.\nThe composite fibreglass in blades is \"the most difficult, and the most expensive part\" of turbines to recycle, Mr Kragelund says.  And there's more of it.\nThere's some reselling of second-hand turbine components from Europe to the Middle East and Asia pacific, he says. Big data, leading to better maintenance regimes and more reliable components could also mean today's blades might last longer, says Siemens's Mr Thompson.\nRecycling has made more progress so far in the onshore than offshore industry, which is newer, he adds. \nBut while \"there is work being done to find ways to recycle materials from old turbines,\" it \"would be nice to see more design input now, so that's easier in the future,\" says Prof Cochrane. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010", "title": "The women who make argan oil want better pay", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:11:41 GMT", "summary": "Argan is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have, but the women workers want more of the money.", "story": "Whether it is being drizzled on salads or turned into face creams, Morocco's argan oil is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have. But with sales soaring around the world, concerns remain about the pay and conditions of the mainly female workforce that produces the oil.\nI watch as a group of women each use two rocks, one large, one small, to smash open the fruit to get to the seeds inside a very hard central nutshell.\nThey sit on cushions on the floor of a cool stone house, beside big piles of the fruit.\n\"I want a better job, with a better salary,\" says one of the workers, 37-year-old Samira Chari. \"But there is nothing else. This is my only option.\"\nWe are in the Moroccan countryside, some 25km (15.5 miles) inland from the port city of Essaouira, halfway down the country's Atlantic coast. It is warm and sunny, and lush green argan trees pepper the arid landscape.\nThe women are employed by a business called Marjana, one of around 300 small firms, mostly co-operatives, that now produce argan oil by extracting it from the seeds. The trees themselves, which are up to 10m (33 ft) tall, are found all over Morocco.\nOften called the country's \"liquid gold\", global sales of argan oil are soaring, helped by studies that suggest it has health benefits. Production, which is almost all from Morocco, is expected to reach 19,623 US tons or $1.79bn (\u00a31.4bn) by 2022 up from 4,836 US tons in 2014.\nIn Morocco argan is traditionally used as a foodstuff - a dip for bread or drizzled on couscous - and as a medicine. But the big growth in demand is being led by the worldwide cosmetics industry. In addition to face creams, it is now being added to products like lip gloss, shampoo, moisturisers and soaps.\nThe women who harvest the seeds are more often from the Berber ethnic group, and this is the case at Marjana, where staff manager Amina Bouna says they bring age-old skills.\n\"Only Berber women know how to extract the oil,\" she says. \"It's old Berber knowledge. Otherwise we have all types of women here - young, old, married and divorced.\"\nThe 80 women at the company are allowed to work as much as they like. But despite many working from early mornings until evenings, they normally make less than $221 (\u00a3170) a month, says Ms Bouna - below Morocco's recommended national minimum wage.\n\"But it's better than they stay at home,\" argues Ms Bouna. \"Before, they made the oil at home. Their husbands sold it on the market and kept the money. Now they don't need their husbands' money, as they make their own. It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe workers do get some health insurance and pensions provision, but Ms Chari wants to see wages go up. Divorced, she says she has to work long hours to afford medicine for her daughter. She says if she were paid more, she'd be able to spend more time with her child.\nAs the industry becomes more lucrative, the issue of the women's wages has become an increasingly hot topic. Zoubida Charrouf, a chemistry professor at Mohammed V University of Rabat is one of the leading advocates for higher salaries.\nProf Charrouf, who also helped to fuel the growth in argan oil sales after publishing studies into its health benefits, says that salaries can be as low as $50 a month.\nShe adds that some of the companies prefer to pay taxi and bus drivers to bring tourists to their facilities so that they can sell them the oil, rather than pay the workers properly.\nThe situation has become such an issue in the country that Morocco's minister of agriculture asked Prof Charrouf for help in forcing firms to join industry trade bodies, and commit to paying staff the minimum wage.\nProf Charrouf says that this work has now started near the city of Agadir, 175km south of Essaouira, and is due to expand north. \"The women are not happy, and need help to fight,\" she adds.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to requests for a comment.\nProf Charrouf says she is also concerned by the rise of industrial argan oil production, where the oil is extracted mechanically on a large scale, driving down prices. \nOil produced this way can cost as little as $22 a litre, less than half the cost of oil made by the small co-operatives.\nHowever, she adds that she is pleased that cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al \nMore from the \nBack at Marjana, 55-year-old employee Khadija Tiktoutj is much less downbeat about her job harvesting the seeds than her colleague Samira Chari. Ms Tiktoutj started working there in 2008, after previously being employed elsewhere as a cleaner.\n\"Argan is a local product, and I really wanted to work with that,\" she says. \"As a cleaning lady, I also did not have health or pension insurance.

The economic cost is also mounting, mainly, but not only, in China. \nThat damage is, for the most part, not due to the virus itself so much as efforts to prevent it spreading.  \nThere are strict restrictions on moving out of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, a city with a population of 11 million. \nThe lockdown, also now extended to other parts of Hubei province, prevents business-related travel as well as the movement of goods and workers.\nFear of the virus also means many people will choose to avoid activities they think might expose them to the risk of infection. \nSo restaurants, cinemas, transport providers, hotels and shops are all quickly feeling the impact.\nAnd the timing of the health crisis, during the lunar New Year break, means those industries have been particularly exposed to commercial losses. \nThe New Year holiday was extended for a few days by the national Chinese authorities and there have been longer extensions imposed by some provincial authorities, delaying the return to work for some businesses even longer. \nAny delay resuming production and selling goods is likely to lead to cash-flow problems, especially for smaller operations.\nMany companies will have to continue paying bills, including employees' pay.\nAnd for manufacturers selling goods abroad, there may be some issues with buyers becoming more reluctant to buy from China.  \nHerbert Wun, who owns Wing Sang Electrical, which makes products such as hair-straighteners and blow-dryers in Guangdong province, told BBC News many companies would not have much slack to take this kind of impact, coming, as it did, on top of the US-China trade war. \nAnd the epidemic \"will add to the pressure on customers trying to shift their supply chain away from China\". \nThe impact is not confined to China.\nInternational retailers have closed operations in China - the furniture seller Ikea and the coffee shop chain Starbucks, for example. \nSeveral overseas airlines have stopped flights to China and international hotel chains have been offering refunds. \nAnd beyond that, there is growing concern about integrated international supply chains. \nChina has a much bigger role in these networks than it did at the time of the last major health problem that emerged from the country - the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) virus 17 years ago. \nHyundai, of South Korea, has suspended its car production because of problems with the supply of parts from its operation in China - an early warning sign of possible extensive disruption ahead. \nChina is an important supplier for the global motor industry and the electronics sector. \nMany mobile phones and computers are made in China or at least have components manufactured there. \nFinancial markets have also felt the effect of the health crisis. \nStock markets around the world are lower than they were two weeks ago. China's market fell 8% on the first day of trading after the holiday.\nThere has been a particularly marked impact on the prices of industrial commodities, as China is such an important buyer. \nCrude oil hit its lowest level in more than a year. \nIt has dropped by about 15% in the past two weeks, reflecting declining demand from China - underlined by reports the country's leading refiner, Sinopec, is cutting back.  \nA group of oil exporting nations is considering production cuts in an effort to reverse the price fall. \nCopper is also cheaper - by about 13% over the past two weeks. \nIt is an important material for the construction industry, which is also sure to be affected in China. \nMany of the suppliers of these commodities are emerging and developing economies.\nIt is early days to attempt to quantify the likely economic effects.\nMuch will depend on how well the Chinese authorities are able to contain the virus. \nBut some forecasters have made rather tentative efforts to put some numbers on the impact.\nOne example is the consultancy Oxford Economics which predicts the Chinese economy will grow less than 4% in the first quarter of 2020 from a year earlier.  \nFor the full year, the forecast is average growth of 5.6%. \nFor both figures, the previous, pre-virus forecast was 6%. \nIt also expects the global economy to grow slightly less - by 0.2 percentage points - than it would have done otherwise.  \nBut Oxford Economic says this is all based on an assumption the \"worst case scenario\" will be avoided. So there is a risk of the economic damage turning out to be more severe. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51208592": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51208592", "title": "How McDonald's revolutionised business", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:10:56 GMT", "summary": "By successfully selling franchises, Ray Kroc turned a tiny hamburger restaurant into a global giant.", "story": "The way Ray Kroc tells the story, when he first encouraged the McDonald brothers to open more hamburger restaurants, they winced. \nThe year was 1954. The place: San Bernardino, California, then a quiet town on the edge of the desert, some 50 miles east of Los Angeles. \nKroc sold milkshake machines and Richard and Maurice (Mac) McDonald were among his best customers. \nTheir restaurant was small, but sold lots of milkshakes. Clearly, they were doing something right.\nBut they did not want to do more of it, and Mac explained why: \"We sit out on the porch in the evenings and watch the sunset. It's peaceful.\"  \nOpening more branches would be a headache - travelling around, finding locations, vetting managers, staying in motels. Why bother? They were already making more money than they could spend.  \nThis made no sense to Kroc. \"His approach was utterly foreign to my thinking,\" he later recalled. \nSo he convinced the brothers to let him expand their restaurant chain. By the time Kroc died, three decades later, McDonald's had thousands of restaurants bringing in billions of dollars.  \nWhich goes to show that successful entrepreneurs are not all the same. They have different talents, and want different things.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nTake Dick and Mac. They were brilliant at figuring out more efficient ways to make hamburgers. \nAs John F Love notes in his book McDonald's: Behind the Arches, the brothers worked with a local craftsman to invent a new kind of spatula, a new dispenser that squirted the same amount of ketchup and mustard every time, and a rotating platform to speed up the process of assembling of burger, bun and condiments.\nWhat Henry Ford had done for cars, the McDonald brothers did for hamburgers and French fries: they broke down processes into simple, repetitive tasks. \nThis meant they could churn out food quickly, cheaply and consistently. There was nothing else like it. \nBut when it came to the wider world, the brothers seem to have been fairly clueless.\nWhen competitors started peering through the windows, taking out notepads and sketching plans, Dick and Mac laughed about it. When anyone asked about those ingenious condiment dispensers, they cheerfully named their craftsman friend. None of them had bothered to patent the design.  \nSome people wanted more than snatched sketches, so the brothers sold franchises - after a fashion. \nFor a one-off fee, you could buy blueprints to their building, with the golden arches, a 15-page description of their \"Speedee Service System\", and a week's training. After that, the franchisees were on their own.  \nDick and Mac did not expect that their trainees would serve the same menu, or even use the same name. When their very first franchisee mentioned that he would also call his new restaurant \"McDonald's\", Dick replied: \"What the hell for?\"  \nInto this smooth-running kitchen and half-baked franchising operation walked a man with different skills and desires. \nRay Kroc was in his 50s, and managing health problems from diabetes to arthritis.  \nBut he was keener on money than peaceful sunsets, and he loved life on the road. \nKroc later wrote that \"finding locations for McDonald's is the most creatively fulfilling thing I can imagine\".  \nWhere the brothers had rethought French fries, Kroc would rethink the franchise concept.  \nThe idea itself was not new. The word \"franchise\" comes from the old French \"franche\", meaning \"free\" or \"exempt\". \nIn ages past, a monarch might have granted you a franchise which would have given you the exclusive right to do a certain thing - to sell armour, or run a cattle market - in a defined area for a set time. \nIn the 19th Century, for instance, you might have bought the exclusive right to sell Singer sewing machines in your local area. \nNowadays franchise operations are everywhere. Stay in a Hilton or Marriott hotel, rent a car from Hertz or Europcar, or shop at a 7-Eleven or Carrefour grocery store, and you are likely to be dealing with a franchise owner.  \nThe idea of the business format franchise seems \nShe built an international network of beauty salons. A former servant, her franchises transformed the lives of many other servant girls. \nBut it was 1950s fast food that gave the franchise its modern form, with not only McDonald's but Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and many now-forgotten brands.  \nKroc's big insight was the importance of conformity. \nYou were not just selling the right to use the company's name and learn its methods - you were imposing an obligation to do things in a certain way. \nMcDonald's opened a full-time training centre, \"Hamburger University\", which drilled students in subjects such as which kind of potatoes to buy.   \nInspectors wrote 27-page reports on whether franchisees cooked food at the right temperatures and kept the bathrooms clean.\nAt first glance, the appeal to the budding restaurateur is not obvious. \nWouldn't you want to design your own branding and develop your own menu? to have started in the 1890s with Canadian Martha Matilda Harper.  just so it can send an inspector to watch you scrub your own toilets? \nWell, much of what you are paying for is the benefit of the brand - and if you are being monitored to make sure you do not cut corners that damage the brand, you can feel reassured that your fellow franchisees are too.\nAs for the franchisor, why not own and operate new branches yourself? Many companies do both - McDonald's owns about 15% of its 36,000-odd outlets.  \nBut franchisees bring a lot to the company, like hard cash: a McDonald's restaurant can cost more than $1m (\u00a3768,000) to launch.  \nFranchisees also provide local knowledge, especially important if you are expanding into a new country with an unfamiliar culture.\nAnd there is motivation: an owner-manager with their own money at stake might put more effort into keeping costs down than a manager on a corporate salary. \nThe economist Alan Krueger found evidence that may support this idea: workers and shift supervisors apparently earn more in company-owned fast food outlets than franchised ones.  \nOf course, both sides bear some risk. The franchisor has to trust that the franchisee will work hard; the franchisee has to trust that the franchisor will create and advertise exciting new products. \nWhen both sides worry about the other side shirking, it's known as \"double-sided moral hazard\". A branch of economics called agency theory tries to understand how franchise contracts solve this problem through their mix of upfront fees and percentage payments.  \nBut it seems to work, perhaps because - like Kroc and the McDonald brothers - different entrepreneurs want different things. \nSome people want the freedom to run their own business, day-to-day, but are not interested in developing products or building a brand. \nOne of the McDonald brothers' early franchisees decided he did not much like their golden arches, so he got his builders to make them pointy and named his restaurant \"Peaks\" instead.  \nThose were freewheeling times. These days, the division of entrepreneurial labour is more likely to be as regimented as a carousel full of hamburgers.  \nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51379061": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51379061", "title": "Tesla: Is the car firm really worth $150bn?", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 21:56:32 GMT", "summary": "The carmaker's market value has grown by about a third in less than a month.", "story": "When Tesla's market value crossed $100bn (\u00a376.7bn) two weeks ago, overtaking Volkswagen, sceptics scoffed.\nBut on Tuesday, it zoomed past $150bn as shares gained more than 13%, rising to more than $887 apiece.\nThe jump means the firm's share price has more than tripled in the last three months, outpacing the predictions of even some of the most optimistic analysts tracking the company.\nIt now ranks as the world's second most valuable car company. So what's behind the turnaround?\nLess than two years ago, things weren't looking quite as rosy for the carmaker.\nThe firm, which has reported losses every year since its start, faced a cash crunch amid production delays and heavy spending. \nDoubts about performance also dogged chief executive Elon Musk, who had a reputation for making promises but failing to deliver.\nTesla's numbers have since improved. The firm has now reported two quarters of profit and its new factory in Shanghai was up and running more quickly than expected. \nSigns also suggest buyer demand has remained healthy, despite fears of a slowdown. Its new Cybertruck drew in about 200,000 orders, \nThe firm has also avoided self-inflicted mistakes, like the tweets from Mr Musk in 2018, which drew allegations of price manipulation, forcing him to step down as chair of the company.\n\"It has become very clear to investors that Tesla has a number of long-term sustainable growth drivers that are very difficult to dispute,\" says Rolf Bulk, an analyst at New Street Research.\nWolfe Research analysts also said they were \"a little surprised by the magnitude\" of the share price increase but \"the abundance of positives explains the move\".\nIn a note to clients last week, they wrote: \"There may be ups and downs, but our view is the stock has found a new range.\"\nRolf Bulk believes that the recent share price increase suggests that some investors betting against the firm have been squeezed, or forced to cut losses and close out positions - a process that involves buying shares, which drives up prices.\nBut S3 Partners, which tracks such activity, said its research shows that recent buying has mostly been done by a mix of everyday investors and big firms with long-term investment goals.\nTesla's stock has been subject to big swings historically and analysts said prices could dive again. Its performance may take a hit, as it spends to open a new factory in Europe. The coronavirus outbreak has also forced its Shanghai factory to shut down temporarily. \nThe prospect of a weak first quarter is \"something that is not fully appreciated by Wall Street today,\" Mr Bulk said. \nTesla delivered more than 367,500 cars last year - up 50% from 2018. It has forecast sales of about 500,000 this year and analysts project that Tesla could hit two million by 2030.\nIts deliveries remain far smaller than its rivals.even after an embarrassing incident where its \"tough\" windows smashed during an on-stage demonstration., while Volkswagen delivered almost 11 million vehicles last year in the first 11 months of 2019. \nHowever, experts say Tesla's electric car technology continues to lead the industry. The firm might be able to sustain that lead for longer than they had expected, even as demand for electric vehicles grows.\nThere is even speculation that the company's investment in battery power could put it in a position to be a supplier to other leading automotive companies.\nIn a recent note to clients Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said if Tesla could achieve all those outcomes, it might be worth about where it is trading today. \nBut he added that that was \"an aggressive 'blue sky' scenario that could take 10 to 20 years to achieve, if it could even be done at all\".\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40726868": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40726868", "title": "How will the petrol and diesel car ban work?", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 13:54:00 GMT", "summary": "A ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be brought forward by eight years to 2032, MPs say.", "story": "A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars is to be brought forward, the government says.\nSo how could the move help the UK meet its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050? And what does it mean for drivers?\nThe ban is being introduced in 2035 - five years earlier than previously planned.\nExperts said the original target of 2040 would be too late if the UK wanted to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050.\nThe ban is also being expanded to hybrid cars and plug-in hybrids, which had not been included under the original proposals.\nAs a result, people will be able to buy only electric or hydrogen cars and vans.\nAbout a third of CO2 emissions in the UK come from transport. \nSo the ban on conventional car sales will certainly help move the UK towards the net-zero target the government announced in 2019.\nThe Committee on Climate Change, which advises government, said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended temperature rise of 1.5C by 2100. This is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change.\nHowever, banning new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars won't be enough on its own.\nThe government will also need to tackle the emissions coming from energy generation. These are almost as high as from transport and come from things such as industry and people's homes.\nEmissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) - which come from car exhausts - regularly exceed safe levels in many cities.\nDiesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of roadside Nox gases. So removing petrol and diesel vehicles from the roads should help bring air quality within the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nAir pollution has been a concern for decades. But the issue gained renewed urgency when the UK government lost court cases over its plans to reduce nitrogen-dioxide levels. \nAs a result, ministers were ordered by the courts to produce a new plan to tackle Nox levels.\nThe discussion was complicated when carmakers were found to be cheating emissions tests.\nBut in recent years, scientists have become more certain about the ways air pollution harms people. Studies have linked it to heart disease and lung problems, as well as other conditions.\nThe Committee on Climate Change believes the cost of electric cars will be similar to that of petrol or diesel vehicles by 2024-25.\nBut for now, electric cars are more expensive than their petrol or diesel counterparts. \nThat's because battery technology is still developing and production requires expensive raw materials and engineers.\nThe UK's most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf, costs \u00a326,000 for a basic model. The government does provide a \u00a33,500 subsidy but for many motorists, the cost is still too high. \nSome experts say a more radical approach, such as no VAT on electric cars, would create a surge in demand. \nA scheme like this exists in Norway, where 2019 saw a huge increase in people opting for electric cars. \nAt present, there is a very small second-hand market for electric cars. \nThat's because they make up less than 1% of the total number of cars on UK roads. \nIf we're to switch to electric cars, the speed of installing charging points will have to radically increase, to cope with demand. \nIt has been estimated the UK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles. \nThere are now nearly 11,000 places in the UK where you can charge electric vehicles. \nWhile there are parts of the country where the number of charging points is keeping up with demand, more are needed in many places.\nAnd there are other potential problems. \nFor example, where will power points be sited? Will roads have to be dug up for cabling? Will drivers have to share power points, and so be restricted to certain charging times?\nPeople who live in flats, or houses without driveways, could struggle to charge their electric cars at home. \nIt is hoped charge points installed in lampposts next to parking bays could help but rollout so far has been limited.\nThere is also a need for more rapid-charging points, for people on long journeys and those who haven't charged overnight.\nThere is currently no UK-wide scrappage scheme in place for petrol and diesel cars and it is unclear if the government is considering this.\nIn London, the city's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a \u00a325m scrappage scheme to take older polluting cars and motorbikes off its streets, to reduce CO2 pollution.\nYou will still be able to buy a second-hand petrol or diesel car in 2035 and drive one you currently own. \nThere could even be a boom in petrol or diesel sales in 2034, as motorists prepare to buy combustion engines for the final time. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51357030": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51357030", "title": "Coronavirus: 'We may have no clothes left to sell'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 01:34:48 GMT", "summary": "We talk to UK firms affected by the disruption caused by the deadly virus.", "story": "\"At the moment, we'll have no products to sell and we could miss Fashion Week in Europe,\" says Xuzhi Chen, a fashion designer who runs just one of the UK businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. \nThe London-based designer is best known for his luxury womenswear collections. \nHe employs 10 workers in Shanghai who focus on operations and creating samples.

We've seen an increase in sales to China of about 80% year-on-year,\" he said.\nTulip's sales to wholesale businesses and restaurants located in China have seen a boost, where pork is often a staple in diets.\nBut Mr Purnell said the company anticipates congestion in Chinese ports could see a \"short-term impact\" on trade, potentially putting a dampener on strong sales.\nExtra safety measures are in place at Chinese ports. The coronavirus originated in the port city of Wuhan in the Hubei province. \nAs for consumer demand being impacted, Mr Purnell said: \"Things are changing day by day, and we're working under the assumption that the outbreak will be bought under control at some point.\"\n\"Usually, we factor in the Chinese New Year and plan our production around that,\" says Tracey Dawson, the managing director of Daletech Electronics. \nThe company is based in Pudsey outside Leeds, and makes circuit boards. \n\"But, we were surprised to hear that that the factory that was due to send us materials this week is in one of the affected provinces - and is on lockdown,\" she says. \nMany UK technology firms depend on suppliers in China for electronics, but the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted production for some.\nMs Dawson told the BBC's Today programme that most of the materials the company uses are imported from China and other Asian countries.\nShe said that her team were sourcing some products from elsewhere, increasing costs and adding a \"business pressure\".\nShe said: \"The impact is of course, on our customers. We're fighting to maintain delivery, and we will absorb the costs in the short term. \n\"But, if this isn't resolved in a timely manner, we anticipate there could be problems.\"\nCharlie Netherton, UK managing director at Marsh Risk Consulting, said smaller firms often don't have the resources to map out their supply chains and think of alternatives should something go wrong.\nMr Netherton said: \"Now is the time to be proactive, now is the time to plan.\n\"That way, it might be unpleasant but it's not as much of a shock.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51019178": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51019178", "title": "Keeping rats out of kitchens and bedbugs out of hotels", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:13:22 GMT", "summary": "Mouse traps and poison are being replaced by internet connected traps and thermal imaging.", "story": "When construction work disturbed a pack of rats near his commercial kitchen business in County Wicklow, Ireland, Shane Bonner knew he needed a savvier approach to pest control. \nHis existing contract, which used a no-frills bait box and regular site inspections, was falling short at Newmarket Kitchen, a rented facility shared by 17 food producers, and giving the wrong impression.\n\"It's not great business having pest controllers on site regularly - people assume there's a problem rather than an inspection; plus we found they were either around when not needed or if there was an issue, the response wasn't fast enough,\" says the entrepreneur.\n\"If an animal was caught (in the trap) we also had no idea how long it had been there, or when or how it got into the building - which affects our peace of mind when running a food business.\"\nSo he opted for a more hi-tech approach.\nPest Pulse traps use pressure sensor technology to identify a catch and alert the company straight away over the internet.  \nPest Pulse is just one of many businesses looking to disrupt an industry worth \u00a3463m and $13.9bn (\u00a310.6bn) annually, in the UK and US respectively. \n\"By knowing exactly when something was caught you can then start look at the bigger picture by checking cameras to see if one of the loading bay doors was left open,\" says Mr Bonner. \n\"It also means our annual pest management charge has come down by 20% because we're not paying for the labour involved in the usual service; and we don't have people coming around unnecessarily.\"\nTim O'Toole, who co-founded Pest Pulse after working at Google and Ebay, believes the makeover is long overdue in an industry he describes as \"reactive, rudimentary and stuck in 1987\". \n\"All other compliance-based industries, for example, food storage using smart fridges, have embraced the IoT [internet of things]. But with pest management we still had a guy checking a box in the corner every 12 weeks and writing the result down on a piece of paper which isn't good enough - rats can multiply very fast.\n\"We've got rising levels of infestation so traditional pest control contracts are having to increase the number of visits from controllers - additional labour costs that will be passed onto the customer,\" he says. \n\"Plus, we're seeing much tighter legislation on the use of biocides [poisons]. Increasingly, its use has to be based on evidence of infestation. So a cost-effective, targeted, tech-led approach with reduced environmental impact becomes much more critical.\"\nBut what if the infestation is harder to find?\nThermal imaging cameras have become a popular tool to detect pests at night or in cavity walls, floors and roofs, illuminating their outline and pinpointing the source for faster, efficient removal. \nPest controller Thomas Bonny in Noyers, France, became aware of the technology's potential in his previous role as a firefighter where it was used to improve visibility in heavy smoke. Using a solution from US manufacturer, FLIR systems, the camera has transformed how he removes wasp nests, by cutting costs and time. \n\"In the past, we relied on sound rather than sight to find a nest, but locating this very faint noise can be very difficult and time consuming,\" he says. \n\"For a single inspection, a thermal imager can save you one or more hours depending on how difficult it is to reach. But it also allows you to quickly find the exact spot of the nest, which means that you only do the minimum required damage. There is no need to rip out entire walls or ceilings to find the right location.\"\nIt explains the growth of thermal imaging in the hotel sector, where the need to detect bedbugs the size of an apple seed, is an increasing problem. Here, the impact of stringent pesticide controls is making it harder to eradicate bed bugs - affecting hotels' reputations and their profits.\nA 2016 study by pest control company, Orkin, of US hotels found that eight of 10 had dealt with an infestation over the previous year, with the average cost per outbreak of $6,383 in replacement of soft-goods, treatment and lost business.\nThe traditional reliance on a diligent housekeeping is no longer cutting it, says Robert Fryers, the chief executive of Spotta, a Cambridge-based business which has developed a more advanced way of tackling such infestations.\nDesigned by entomologists, the Spotta pod, is positioned in the bedbug's sweet spot between the mattress and bedframe, the pod contains a synthetic pheromone that draws the insects into the trap usually within hours of their arrival.\n\"Bedbugs have always been a problem for hotels but with climate change and the rise in international travel from hot countries it has become much worse - although it isn't talked about much in the industry. \n\"Historically, hotels could only deal with this reactively, when a guest complained, and by that point the damage is done,\" says Mr Fryers.\nAlgorithm analysis identifies the insect, distinguishing between a tropical bedbug, carbon beetle or silverfish and a camera takes a picture with all data emailed to the hotel. The contents of the pod are then sealed in and returned to Spotta's laboratory for sterilization. \n\"People assume these bugs are down to a hotel's poor cleanliness. But they are brought in by people from their clothes and bags, which is why we're finding the greatest traction with city and airport hotels that have a high turnover of international guests,\" says Mr Fryers. \n\"In the US, lawsuits and compensation claims on the issue are becoming more prevalent. Hotels need to be able to demonstrate they are doing everything they can.\"\nSo while it might seem expensive to employ hi-tech pest control, it could save some even bigger legal bills.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073", "title": "The medieval knight who went into space", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:07:16 GMT", "summary": "Multimillionaire computer games veteran Richard Garriott is also a pioneer of space tourism.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Richard Garriott, computer games veteran, and space tourism pioneer.\nBlasting into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket, Richard Garriott says it was \"the most intense eight and a half minutes\" of his life.\nLaunched from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan, it took just that amount of time for the rocket to hit 28,000 km/h (17,000mph) and reach orbit.\nThis was back in October 2008, when Richard became only the sixth person to go into space as a paying traveller. He spent 12 days on the International Space Station. \"It was a truly profound and life-changing experience,\" says the 58-year-old.\nThe trip was the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition for Richard, who, thanks to making a fortune in the computer games industry, could afford the price - a whopping $30m (\u00a323m). It also allowed him to follow in the footsteps of his father Owen, an astronaut who twice went into space with Nasa, in 1973 and 1983.\nRichard had wanted to join Nasa, too, as a younger man, but his ambition was blocked because his eyesight was not good enough. Instead he started to design computer games as a teenager. \nRaised near Houston, Texas, Richard remembers his high school getting its first computer in the mid-1970s.  As he was an excellent science student, he says that the teachers let him use it as often as he liked.\n\"They basically said 'well, we have this computer that we don't know what to do with - it's yours, do what you want with it'.\"\nDiscovering that he was something of a natural at computer programming, he started to design his own games. In 1979, aged 18, one of his games was released commercially.\nWorking part time in a computer store, Richard had shown his role-playing game - Akalabeth: World of Doom - to his manager. The man was so impressed that he asked Richard to make copies that he could sell from the shop.\nIt caught the eye of one of the first gaming distributors, who said he wanted to ship them nationwide. Some 30,000 copies were sold, from which Richard was paid $150,000 in royalties \"for a few weeks of afterschool time at high school\". \nThat amount of money was nearly three times his father's annual Nasa salary. \"I sat down with the rest of the family, who said 'well, this is a good idea, maybe you should do more of these', and I started my career.\"\nHis parents did, however, insist that he still went to university, and so he enrolled on a degree at the University of Texas at Austin. While at college he released the first instalment of his fantasy world, role-playing game series Ultima. Think dungeons and dragons, medieval knights, and wizards. \nWith Ultima 1 selling 50,000 copies, Richard ultimately dropped out of college to focus on making computer games full time. And together with his brother he set up a business called Origin Systems to release the later versions of the game.\nThe Ultima series went on to sell millions of units, and gained a dedicated following within the growing gaming community. Richard would connect with devotees by going to fan conventions dressed in medieval costume, as a character from the game called Lord British. \nHowever, on one occasion things took a dark turn when a crazed fan broke into his Texan house, and Richard had to fire off warning shots from his Uzi machine gun to defend himself before the police arrived.\nIn 1992, Richard and his brother sold Origin to gaming giant Electronic Arts for $35m. Richard stayed with Electronic for eight years, before leaving to create a new business called Destination Games. A number of other gaming firms then followed, with his current company - Portalarium - formed in 2008.\nConsidered a pioneer within the gaming community, it is widely accepted that Richard was the first person to use the term \"avatar\" to apply to the on-screen representation of a person playing a computer game.\nHe says he still loves working in the industry. \"I am a very light-hearted person,\" he says. \n\"I'm a devout believer in work should be fun. If work is not fun, you are doing the wrong work.\n\"Maybe that's idealistic, and it's not fair to presume everyone in life can have that opportunity. [But] if you can enjoy the work you're doing, it makes life better, and so that's one of the markers of success, being able to do that.\"\nTo help get himself into space, Richard co-founded a company called Space Adventures in 1998. Unlike the continuing efforts of Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's Space X, Space Adventures didn't set out to build its own spacecraft. Instead it would arrange for its customers to hitch a ride on the flights of the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Nasa was also asked, but said \"no\".\nThe first person to get into space thanks to Space Adventures was American businessman Dennis Tito, who in 2001 became the world's first space tourist. Richard's trip came seven years later, and although he co-owns the company he still had to pay the full price. Space Adventures has so far put seven people into space.\nFred Schmidt, a Texan technology consultant, says that \"Richard's number one trait in his ongoing entrepreneurial journey is how his boundless imagination plays in tandem with his insatiable curiosity\". \nMeanwhile, Richard Wiese, president of the Explorers Club, a professional society that promotes scientific exploration, says that Richard \"is often the smartest and most creative person in the room\".\nHe adds: \"The idea that Richard would figure a way to get himself into space when ordinary paths proved impossible speaks volumes on how he views the possible. I often wonder if Richard gets the proper credit for being one of the first pioneers in private space.\"\nLooking ahead, Richard says he wants to return to space. \"I dream about my past and future space flights,\" he says. \"Having travelled once to space only deepens your desire to spend more time there.\n\"I experienced what many astronauts refer to as 'the overview effect', which makes your bond and care of the Earth greatly deepen.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376101": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376101", "title": "Food Chain: Pumping up gluten

year will see big batches of platforms going up on a near monthly basis.\nThe aim is to have the full network in operation by the end of 2021.    \nOneWeb is in a race with a number of other companies that want to provide the same kind of service.\nCalifornia entrepreneur Elon Musk is developing his Starlink constellation which envisages thousands of connected satellites. \nLikewise, the boss of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, the world's wealthiest individual, has proposed a system he calls Kuiper.\nBut OneWeb CEO Adrian Steckel says his start-up has nothing to fear from these \"100lb gorillas\". \n\"I  think they're going to do great; we're going to do great,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's room for three or four of us. The world is a big place and the appetite for data is insatiable. This won't be a game of 'winner takes all'.\"\nThe Soyuz rocket left Baikonur at 02:42 local time on Friday, 7 February (21:42 GMT on Thursday, 6 February).\nIts mission was to drop its satellite batch into one of 12 planes planned for the constellation. Next month, another Soyuz will loft a further 34 spacecraft to begin populating two more planes.\nEventually, the full network will comprise 648 satellites (60 of which will be in-orbit spares ready to fill behind any failures).\nIt's an ambitious roll-out made possible by high volume manufacturing at a factory set up in Florida by OneWeb and the aerospace giant Airbus, who are partners on the the project.\nUp to two spacecraft a day are now rolling off the production line.\nBut while the media are very focused on the numbers of satellites and rockets involved, these elements won't define the west London company's future success or failure.\nThis will depend more on the relationships OneWeb is able to establish with the telcos and other organisations that will be exploiting and distributing its internet service around the world.\nIt's partly because of this that OneWeb is emphasising its \"Britishness\".\nAlthough founded by an American with backing from some big international brands, the firm believes the UK association will help it obtain the \"landing rights\" necessary for its service to be allowed to operate in different countries.\n\"We consider ourselves as an international project, but we navigate in a difficult world where not everybody gets along,\" Mr Steckel said. \"And our sense is that the UK's flag and approach allows us to have dialogue with partners that we otherwise might not have the ability to do.\" \nElon Musk and his SpaceX company have already entered a high cadence of launches, with 240 Starlink satellites placed in orbit since May last year. But the rapid deployment means this American project has walked first into the backlash that may ultimately confront all the coming mega-constellations.\nAstronomers have been complaining that the internet satellites are too bright. They fear that if thousands of spacecraft are put in orbit, it could seriously impede their view of the cosmos. \nOneWeb has so far avoided much of the flack because until Friday's flight, it had put up only six test satellites. This could now change with the monthly roll-out.\nBut Mr Steckel believes his company's spacecraft won't attract the same ire.\n\"It's our understanding that our satellites will be less visible - one, because they're higher in the sky; and, two, because of their design. But we're engaging with the astronomical community. And that's not just PR - we really want to see what we can do.\"\nLast month, both OneWeb and SpaceX met with European scientists for discussions at the Royal Astronomical Society in London. @BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-51279607": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-51279607", "title": "Why is there less snow on Scotland's mountains this year?", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:00:51 GMT", "summary": "Enthusiasts say they have noticed a difference in conditions on the hills in recent years.", "story": "But enthusiasts say they have noticed a difference in recent years, with milder weather leading to less snow cover.\nIt has snowed this year, and is expected to do so again when Storm Ciara hits Scotland in the coming days, but lots of what has fallen has melted in thaws or been stripped away by strong winds.\nBen Dolphin, president of Ramblers Scotland and a winter walking enthusiast, said it wasn't unusual for conditions to vary from year to year on the hills.\nBut he added: \"I don't know any Scottish winter enthusiast who'd feel at ease with what's happened for the last two years, or who would think those winters fit into the 'normal' pattern of mild and cold winters. \n\"It's not just the lack of snow, it's the high night-time temperatures, and the longevity and persistence of mild weather patterns.\"\nHe said warm air was being drawn up from the Azores for weeks at a time. \n\"These recent winters do feel different.

For welfare reasons, he does not run the sled dogs at temperatures of over 10C.\n\"It's not rocket science,\" he said. \"It's climate change.\"\nHe added: \"The temperature is the main thing.

They make planes fall out the sky and bridges fall down. On a more mundane level they trip you up on a badly-maintained pavement.  \nNow Strathclyde University in Glasgow is claiming a world-first with a centre dedicated to a new science of cracking-up.\nThe concept of peridynamics - from the classical Greek words for \"around\" and \"force\" - emerged from the United States at the turn of the century.  \nIt uses sophisticated computational models to simulate and analyse these fissures that can mean the difference between triumph and disaster.  \nBut the director of Strathclyde's Peridynamics Research Centre, Dr Erkan Oterkus, says cracks are not always a bad thing.  \n\"Think about a chocolate bar,\" he says. \"If you want to enjoy this bar you have to open the package.  \n\"To open the package, what you need to do is tear the package. So you need to create a crack.\" \nSo far, so delicious.  \n\"Then your teeth need to split this chocolate bar into smaller pieces. Your teeth are actually creating lots of cracks in your mouth. If you think about it, cracks are everywhere.\"\nDr Oterkus came to Glasgow from Turkey via Nasa in Virginia. His co-director Dr Selda Oterkus is also his wife.  \nThe peridynamics centre is part of Strathclyde's engineering faculty but it is not all bridges, planes and ships. \nSelda explains that they have been working with the Japanese giant Samsung to examine cracking in electronic components.  \nThese cracks appear because of steam in unexpected places.  \n\"The electronic package has polymer components,\" she says. \n\"During storage and shipping these components absorb moisture. Then during the soldering process, when you want to combine the electronic components together, the temperature rises and it creates vapour pressure - it creates a crack.\"  \nShe has a food-based analogy - popcorn.  \n\"It's the same idea. If you want to make popcorn in your home, it has a shell and it has content in it,\" she says.  \n\"And when you heat it, the shell gets broken because of high vapour pressure inside.\"  \nOther methods already exist for studying how cracks form and spread but each tends to focus on a different scale: very small things or quite big ones.  \nThe computer modelling used in peridynamics means it can be used to simulate cracks of any size in often complex materials like composites.  \nA fundamental principle is that the same equation can be applied to a material whether or not it has a crack.  \nOne challenge to which it is being applied is global heating. \nAs the climate warms it is opening shorter shipping routes between the Far East, America and Europe through seas on the edge of the Arctic.  \nThe sea ice on these northern routes can be cracked but ships can crack too. Peridynamics can simulate the behaviour of both as they interact.  \n\"What we know from history, for example the Titanic accident, is that if we are just designing ships without considering the effect of ice impact, it can create big damage to the ship's structure,\" Erkan says.  \n\"By using peridynamic methodology we are trying to simulate what is happening in this particular process.  \n\"We are modelling ice as a material and the ship as a material, and we are trying to simulate what happens when these two different objects are in contact with each other.\"  \nPeridynamics can also simulate how aircraft behave when they are struck by hail or lightning. \nBut it can also be applied to softer objects too. Like us. \nIt can be used to calculate the damage a bullet would do to a human body.  \nThermal flows, whether in an aircraft struck by lightning or a cold glass suddenly filled - and cracked - by hot water can be calculated.  \nThe discipline challenges not just existing techniques, but tenets of physics that have prevailed for more than 2,000 years.  \nThe Aristotelian view was straightforward: to move something you must touch it.  \nThat works but it's not the whole story. \nLet's say you want to smash a wine glass.  \nYou could throw it at the wall. You've touched it and it's moved - that's what's called a local force.  \nOr you could just drop the glass on the floor. You haven't thrown it - gravity did the work this time, without touching it.

They are killing the next generation,\" Prof Lewis says.\nIn Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, the industry has existed for a few decades, but is usually poorly-managed, she explains.\nCongregating Mangrove fireflies live exclusively in mangrove trees along rivers.\nMales gather in huge numbers to attract females, producing the appealing glowing swarms that tourists desire.\nMotorised boats are driven up the rivers, creating water swells that erode the banks, killing the trees where the fireflies live.\n\"Operators also crash boats into the banks to disturb trees and make fireflies fly out, creating a swarm for tourists to see,\" Prof Lewis explains. \n\"There is evidence that even just camera flashes disturb fireflies and interfere with their reproductive success, in addition to the flashlights used by tourists\".\nProf Lewis is keen to emphasise that firefly tourism is often crucial to local economies and should not be banned.\nInstead tour operators and tourists can develop eco-friendly practices.\nTravel blogger Katie Diederichs and her husband, both from the US, chose an eco-friendly tour operator in Bohol, Philippines for their firefly experience in 2015. \nTravelling in a small group at night in kayaks with just one light, the experience was designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, Katie explains.\n\"The amount of light from the fireflies made the mangroves look like Christmas trees - it was really magical. \n\"The male fireflies were flying around, giving the illusion of twinkling, while the females blink.\" \nThe company is run by locals who love the fireflies and want to protect their environment, she explains.\nBut Katie says they witnessed other operators with \"large motorboat of tourists\" passing by them \"sending waves in our direction.\"\nIn Taiwan, the tourist board has invested in sustainable firefly tours and created \"thoughtful and effective\" firefly eco-tourism, Prof Lewis explains.\nSites have regulated guided tours with raised walkways that allow small groups of people to walk through the habitat without trampling on fireflies. \nInstead of flashlights or headlamps that would disturb the insects, white paint illuminates the routes.\nA group of scientists will meet in 2020 to set down guidelines for how to run a sustainable firefly tourism company, Prof Lewis says.\n\"It is very important to not disturb the fireflies' habitat while photographing,\" \nShe regularly photographs the Big Dipper firefly, as well as other wildlife, where she lives in the Catskill mountains in New York.\nWatch where you walk, she says, and be careful with your light sources.\n\"And for goodness sake, please don't ever capture them!\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51403935", "title": "Poorer households may get help on energy bills", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:01:06 GMT", "summary": "The burden of paying for clean energy technology could be shifted to the tax payer.", "story": "Households struggling with energy bills may get help from a government review of clean technology funding.\nAt the moment, an annual levy is imposed on gas and electricity bills to fund renewables such as offshore wind.\nThe burden falls disproportionately on the poorest in society, and it will get worse as the UK expands clean energy to tackle climate change.\nThe BBC has been told the government may shift the cost onto tax payers to avoid anger at climate policies.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are definitely considering the way that costs are distributed.\"\nCurrently about \u00a310bn a year is being invested to support clean technology.

Both are expensive.\nA few years ago, government economists predicted that gas plants equipped with CCS would be producing 30% of the UK\u2019s clean electricity in the future. Nuclear and renewables would produce another 30% each.\nTom Burke, an expert on climate change, forecast at that time that only CCS could save the climate. When I reminded him yesterday, he admitted: \u201cI was wrong\u201d.\nThe equation radically changed because the nuclear renaissance didn\u2019t happen; the government pulled funding from CCS projects; and the cost of renewables plummeted. \nThe government has now offered new CCS funds - but for tackling carbon emissions from industrial clusters, rather than from power generation. \nThe new technology report comes from a government-funded consortium of academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London.\nIt\u2019s being debated in the Lords on Thursday. The debate\u2019s sponsor, Baron Browne of Ladyton, said it carries important messages that should be heard. \nThe report says: \u201cBusinesses and the public want to act to eliminate emissions, but exaggerated claims about the speed at which new technologies can be introduced are holding back progress.\"\nIt continued: \u201cRelying on breakthrough technologies to achieve zero emissions by 2050 is risky and delays action. \n\u201cInstead, with today\u2019s technologies we can meet the target for almost all activities, but we have no substitutes for cement, shipping, flying, lamb or beef.\u201d \nThe report says the UK can anticipate having four times as much emissions-free electricity in 2050 as today if current rates of renewables expansion continue. \nThis, it says, is enough to supply 60% of today\u2019s energy-using activities, if they are electrified. \nIt says to close the remaining energy gap, we could make incremental changes to the way we use technologies - such as buying smaller cars rather than SUVs.\nAnother option is to take the train instead of the car, or put more passengers in fewer cars (ride sharing).\nYet another possibility is to only heat rooms where people are sitting, and swap gas boilers for heat pumps when they need to be changed. \nThe government, the report says, should start a debate on these issues.\nIt says the two outstandingly difficult areas to de-carbonise are shipping and cement manufacture.\nJulian Allwood, lead author and professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, told BBC News: \"The problem with delivering climate mitigation is the tension between the government wanting to deliver solutions based on technology and protestors and scientists asking for fast action that bites much more rapidly than we can bring new technologies into place. \n\"So although new technologies may become relevant by 2100, the number operating at scale in 2050 will be very few. Probably we\u2019ve got to deliver on climate change with today\u2019s technologies.\"\nThe message contradicts several comments from the Prime Minister putting faith in technology to deliver 2050 targets. Recently, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no one needed to fly less, and that technology would solve the problem.\nThe government has committed to having CCS in industrial clusters from the second half of the 2020s and CCS at scale by 2030.\nThe net zero scenario from the Committee on Climate Change includes 75-175 Megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 being captured and stored per year by 2050.\nThe report's authors say it typically takes 30 years for a major new technology such as carbon capture to solve all its complexities, including legal and safety implications; and public concerns, before it begins to be widely adopted. \nBut this will be too late to hit the government's 2050 targets.\nA government spokesperson said: \"Achieving net zero by 2050 requires decisive action across the economy, including developing a range of approaches and technologies. \n\"Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), for example, can play an essential role as part of a balanced approach.

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic.

She held a simple sign, black letters on a white board, that said \"School Strike for Climate.\"\n\"It felt like I was the only one who cared about the climate and the ecological crisis,\" she told the BBC. The 15-year-old was by herself, but not for long.\nWithin a year, her school strike, carried on through all weather, had inspired millions of young people around the world to take to the streets and demand action on climate change. \nAs thousands of students again protest in major global cities, here's a look at what we know about the teenager who started it all.\nMs Thunberg, the elder of two girls, was born on 3 January, 2003. She grew up in Stockholm with her mother Malena Ernman, an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant, and her actor father Svante Thunberg. Her father is a descendant of Svante Arrhenius, a scientist who came up with a model of the greenhouse effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. \nMs Thunberg said her parents were \"as far from climate activists as possible\" before she made them aware of the issue. She persuaded her parents to become vegan, and in 2016 convinced her mother to stop flying, despite her mother frequently travelling overseas for work. \nThey have co-written a book with their daughter called Our House is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis. It is set to be released in March. \nMs Thunberg has Asperger's Syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift and a superpower.\nShe says she first learned about climate change when she was eight and couldn't understand why people weren't taking action. \n\"I remember thinking it was very strange that we were capable of changing the entire face of the Earth and the precious thin layer of atmosphere that makes it our home. Because if we were capable of doing this, then \n\" she wrote in the Guardian.\nIn May 2018, Ms Thunberg won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper. Three months later, she decided to start protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue until the government met the why weren't we hearing about it everywhere?. \nMs Thunberg said her parents weren't enthusiastic about her protest at the start, and told her that she would have to do it without their help. \nAfter she was pictured outside the Swedish parliament building with her sign, the teenager's protests went viral on social media. \nAs support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world, and the message spread with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. \nMs Thunberg travelled to some of the strikes in Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment. \nIn April, she made an appearance at the Extinction Rebellion protests in London, telling the crowd: \"For way too long, the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.\"\nIn September, Ms Thunberg travelled to New York address the UN Climate Conference. She made her way there on a zero-emissions boat in a journey that lasted two weeks. \nThe week of her arrival, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence.  \nDuring her address at the UN, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. \n\"How dare you,\" she said. \"I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? \n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We will be watching you.\"\nAt the end of 2019, she was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. \nHer message has not been well received by everyone, carbon emissions target set out by world leaders in Paris in 2015. But she has responded defiantly and often with humour.\nAfter her UN appearance, US President Donald Trump appeared to mock her by saying she \"seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\".\nMs Thunberg then changed her Twitter biography to include Mr Trump's words. She did the same weeks later when Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\".\nIn January, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the teenager to most notably prominent conservative voices. His comments came after she called on world leaders to abandon fossil fuels at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nAs for the teenager's schooling, she took the whole of 2019 off school to be able to attend the climate conference in New York and the world's major annual climate summit in Madrid in December.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317", "title": "Mud wasps used to date Australia's aboriginal rock art", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:18:54 GMT", "summary": "Scientists use the remains of wasps\u2019 nests to date Australia\u2019s ancient aboriginal rock art.", "story": "When the veteran telecoms engineer Damien Finch went on a three-week bush walk in Australia's Kimberley region, he became enthralled with its rock art.\nOn his return home, he tried to find out more about these enigmatic aboriginal paintings and engravings.\n\"I couldn't believe how little was known about them; we didn't even know how old they were,\" Damien said.\n\"It seemed disrespectful that scientists hadn't studied this stuff more; it was downplaying the importance of the culture,\" he told BBC News.\nNow, 10 years on and in his 60s, Damien is putting that right.\nHe's approaching the end of his doctoral research on the topic, and \n, has published his own efforts to age the Kimberley's so-called Gwion figures.\nThese feature finely painted human forms, often in elaborate ceremonial dress and carrying spears and boomerangs.\nIt was thought they were painted some 16,000 years ago, but the University of Melbourne investigator has been able to show the likely age is nearer in time - at about 12,000 years ago. \nDating rock art is really hard. Aboriginal artists use iron oxide pigments (ochre) which contain no organic material and are therefore resistant to any radiocarbon analysis.\nDamien has got around this by studying instead the scraps of organic matter stuck on top of and underneath the paintings.\nAnd for this, he's working with wasps. In particular, the ones that build nests out of mud. There's a wide group of these.\nSome will enclose their prey - such as a paralysed spider or caterpillar - inside an earthen box. Before sealing the lid, the wasps lay an egg on the unfortunate victim. The developing larva then consumes the immobile spider or caterpillar, eventually digging its way out of the nest as an adult to carry on the cycle.\nFrom Damien's point of view, when the female wasp gathers her mud supplies she inevitably picks up fragments of charcoal from the Kimberley's fire-prone landscape. And this charcoal can be radiocarbon dated.\nHe's examined the remains or more than 20 ancient nests at various rock art sites. \nMaterial that smothers pigment gives a minimum age; underlying material provides a maximum age.\nA distribution of dates from many locations enables an estimate to be made for when the Gwion style was in vogue. \n\"All this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea-levels. Things like that.\"\nThe paintings he and his team have been working on are, of course, sites of immense cultural significance. \nAll the sampling was guided and approved by representatives from the traditional owners of the artwork.  \n\"We couldn't have done what we did without their active support and encouragement,\" Damien told BBC News.\nHe's hopeful the mud-wasp dating technique can now be used at more locations right across the north of Australia, and perhaps at other rock art locations in the Americas and Europe. \nGavin Broad is the principal curator in charge of insects at London's Natural History Museum. He described the Australian research as \"very smart\".  \n\"There was a paper about this some years ago, but the techniques seem to have improved since then,\" he told BBC News.\n\"In this study, the nests are made by \n, which are wasps of the family Sphecidae, superfamily Apoidea.  \n\"These are well-known mud-daubers in much of the warmer parts of the world.  \n\"However, the real diversity of potter wasps is in the Eumeninae, a subfamily of Vespidae (superfamily Vespoidea).  Their nests range from holes in mud to simple cells (like \n) to ornate little pots.  \n\"There are also some spider-hunting wasps (family Pompilidae), which represent at least a third evolution of making clay nests.\"\n and follow me on Twitter: \nin this week's Science Advances journal\n@BBCAmos\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382", "title": "The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 21:16:05 GMT", "summary": "When Li Wenliang warned about a Sars-like virus at his hospital in Wuhan, authorities tried to silence him.", "story": "Dr Li Wenliang, who was hailed a hero for raising the alarm about the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak, has died of the infection.\nHis death was confirmed by the Wuhan hospital where he worked and was being treated, \nDr Li, 34, tried to send a message to fellow medics about the outbreak at the end of December.

In comparison, more than 40 male scientists or their discoveries were mentioned.\nMeanwhile, a separate poll conducted by the charity revealed half of people are unable to name a single female scientist, alive or dead.\nBut it is not just Britain's men who have made pioneering scientific discoveries. Here are some of the overlooked British women whose research changed the world.\nSomerville was named the 19th Century's \"queen of science\" after her death.\nHer popular books linked up and explained different areas of scientific study, and her detailed work on the solar system was influential in the discovery of Neptune.\nShe made history in 1835 when she jointly became the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society in London.\nSomerville has been on the Royal Bank of Scotland's \u00a310 notes since 2017.\nA self-taught pioneer, Anning discovered Jurassic remains in her hometown of Lyme Regis.\nShe came across her first find - an ancient reptile later named an Ichthyosaurus - at the age of 12.\nThe Natural History Museum calls her the \"unsung hero of fossil discovery\", as the scientific community was reluctant to recognise her contributions to science during her lifetime.\nShe was not allowed to be part of the Geological Society of London, for example. In fact, it did not admit women until more than half a century after her death.\nAda Lovelace was a leading 19th century mathematician credited with creating early computer programs.\nShe worked with her friend Charles Babbage, an inventor and mechanical engineer, on his proposals for an \"Analytical Engine\".\nThe device was never built, but the design had the essential elements of a modern computer.\nHer notes described how codes could be created for the handling of letters, symbols and numbers. \nShe also created a method for the machine to repeat a series of instructions - a process known as \"looping\", which computer programs still use today.\nGarrett Anderson was the first woman to qualify in the UK as a doctor - but it wasn't easy to get there.\nIn her mid-20s, she enrolled as a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital in London.\nShe attended lectures and observed the male medical students, but no university would let her take the exams to become a doctor.\nHowever, after finding that the Society of Apothecaries couldn't legally refuse her, she qualified in 1865. \nShe subsequently opened the St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children in London and co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women. \nShe was the sister of Suffragist leader Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and campaigned for women's right to vote.\nWiddowson devoted her life to improving people's diets in Britain and overseas.\nIn 1940, when food was being rationed during World War Two, she published a book called The Chemical Composition of Foods that contained details of the nutritional values of many foods.\nShe was one of the dieticians who oversaw the addition of vitamins to food during wartime rationing.\nHodgkin was born in Cairo to a British couple who were working in the north African country during a period when it was under British control.\nBut she herself largely spent her childhood in Norfolk and was educated at a state school in Beccles, Suffolk, \nShe used X-ray technology to discover the structures of penicillin, insulin, and vitamin B12.\nIn 1964 she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry - and is still the only British woman to have done so.\nShe also lectured former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who studied chemistry at Somerville College in Oxford in the 1940s.\nFrom 1976 to 1988, Hodgkin was president of the Pugwash Conference, an international organisation set up in the 1950s to assess the dangers of nuclear weapons.\nProfessor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell is credited with one of the most important discoveries of the last century: the discovery of radio pulsars.\nPulsars are the by-products of supernova explosions that make all life possible.\nProf Bell Burnell was overlooked for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974, even though the award went to two male academics who worked alongside her.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50757073", "title": "The medieval knight who went into space", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:07:16 GMT", "summary": "Multimillionaire computer games veteran Richard Garriott is also a pioneer of space tourism.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Richard Garriott, computer games veteran, and space tourism pioneer.\nBlasting into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket, Richard Garriott says it was \"the most intense eight and a half minutes\" of his life.\nLaunched from the Baikonur space centre in Kazakhstan, it took just that amount of time for the rocket to hit 28,000 km/h (17,000mph) and reach orbit.\nThis was back in October 2008, when Richard became only the sixth person to go into space as a paying traveller. He spent 12 days on the International Space Station. \"It was a truly profound and life-changing experience,\" says the 58-year-old.\nThe trip was the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition for Richard, who, thanks to making a fortune in the computer games industry, could afford the price - a whopping $30m (\u00a323m). It also allowed him to follow in the footsteps of his father Owen, an astronaut who twice went into space with Nasa, in 1973 and 1983.\nRichard had wanted to join Nasa, too, as a younger man, but his ambition was blocked because his eyesight was not good enough. Instead he started to design computer games as a teenager. \nRaised near Houston, Texas, Richard remembers his high school getting its first computer in the mid-1970s.  As he was an excellent science student, he says that the teachers let him use it as often as he liked.\n\"They basically said 'well, we have this computer that we don't know what to do with - it's yours, do what you want with it'.\"\nDiscovering that he was something of a natural at computer programming, he started to design his own games. In 1979, aged 18, one of his games was released commercially.\nWorking part time in a computer store, Richard had shown his role-playing game - Akalabeth: World of Doom - to his manager. The man was so impressed that he asked Richard to make copies that he could sell from the shop.\nIt caught the eye of one of the first gaming distributors, who said he wanted to ship them nationwide. Some 30,000 copies were sold, from which Richard was paid $150,000 in royalties \"for a few weeks of afterschool time at high school\". \nThat amount of money was nearly three times his father's annual Nasa salary. \"I sat down with the rest of the family, who said 'well, this is a good idea, maybe you should do more of these', and I started my career.\"\nHis parents did, however, insist that he still went to university, and so he enrolled on a degree at the University of Texas at Austin. While at college he released the first instalment of his fantasy world, role-playing game series Ultima. Think dungeons and dragons, medieval knights, and wizards. \nWith Ultima 1 selling 50,000 copies, Richard ultimately dropped out of college to focus on making computer games full time. And together with his brother he set up a business called Origin Systems to release the later versions of the game.\nThe Ultima series went on to sell millions of units, and gained a dedicated following within the growing gaming community. Richard would connect with devotees by going to fan conventions dressed in medieval costume, as a character from the game called Lord British. \nHowever, on one occasion things took a dark turn when a crazed fan broke into his Texan house, and Richard had to fire off warning shots from his Uzi machine gun to defend himself before the police arrived.\nIn 1992, Richard and his brother sold Origin to gaming giant Electronic Arts for $35m. Richard stayed with Electronic for eight years, before leaving to create a new business called Destination Games. A number of other gaming firms then followed, with his current company - Portalarium - formed in 2008.\nConsidered a pioneer within the gaming community, it is widely accepted that Richard was the first person to use the term \"avatar\" to apply to the on-screen representation of a person playing a computer game.\nHe says he still loves working in the industry. \"I am a very light-hearted person,\" he says. \n\"I'm a devout believer in work should be fun. If work is not fun, you are doing the wrong work.\n\"Maybe that's idealistic, and it's not fair to presume everyone in life can have that opportunity. [But] if you can enjoy the work you're doing, it makes life better, and so that's one of the markers of success, being able to do that.\"\nTo help get himself into space, Richard co-founded a company called Space Adventures in 1998. Unlike the continuing efforts of Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's Space X, Space Adventures didn't set out to build its own spacecraft. Instead it would arrange for its customers to hitch a ride on the flights of the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Nasa was also asked, but said \"no\".\nThe first person to get into space thanks to Space Adventures was American businessman Dennis Tito, who in 2001 became the world's first space tourist. Richard's trip came seven years later, and although he co-owns the company he still had to pay the full price. Space Adventures has so far put seven people into space.\nFred Schmidt, a Texan technology consultant, says that \"Richard's number one trait in his ongoing entrepreneurial journey is how his boundless imagination plays in tandem with his insatiable curiosity\". \nMeanwhile, Richard Wiese, president of the Explorers Club, a professional society that promotes scientific exploration, says that Richard \"is often the smartest and most creative person in the room\".\nHe adds: \"The idea that Richard would figure a way to get himself into space when ordinary paths proved impossible speaks volumes on how he views the possible. I often wonder if Richard gets the proper credit for being one of the first pioneers in private space.\"\nLooking ahead, Richard says he wants to return to space. \"I dream about my past and future space flights,\" he says. \"Having travelled once to space only deepens your desire to spend more time there.\n\"I experienced what many astronauts refer to as 'the overview effect', which makes your bond and care of the Earth greatly deepen.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51097309": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51097309", "title": "Antarctica melting: Climate change and the journey to the 'doomsday glacier'", "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 05:00:03 GMT", "summary": "Thwaites Glacier, also known as the \"doomsday glacier\", is reported to be melting quicker than previously thought - scientists are now trying to find out why.", "story": "Sediment sweeps past the camera as Icefin, a bright yellow remotely operated robot submarine, moves tentatively forward under the ice.\nThen the waters begin to clear.\nIcefin is under almost half a mile (600m) of ice, at the front of one the fastest-changing large glaciers in the world.\nSuddenly a shadow looms above, an overhanging cliff of dirt-encrusted ice.\nIt doesn't look like much, but this is a unique image - the first ever pictures from a frontier that is changing our world.\nIcefin has reached the point at which the warm ocean water meets the wall of ice at the front of the mighty Thwaites glacier - the point where this vast body of ice begins to melt.\nGlaciologists have described Thwaites as the \"most important\" glacier in the world, the \"riskiest\" glacier, even the \"doomsday\" glacier.\nIt is massive - roughly the size of Britain.\nIt already accounts for 4% of world sea level rise each year - a huge figure for a single glacier - and satellite data show that it is melting increasingly rapidly.\nThere is enough water locked up in it to raise world sea level by more than half a metre.\nAnd Thwaites sits like a keystone right in the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet - a vast basin of ice that contains more than 3m of additional potential sea level rise.\nYet, until this year, no-one has attempted a large-scale scientific survey on the glacier.\nThe Icefin team, along with 40 or so other scientists, are part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a five-year, $50m (\u00a338m) joint UK-US effort to understand why it is changing so rapidly.\nThe project represents the biggest and most complex scientific field programme in Antarctic history. \nYou may be surprised that so little is known about such an important glacier - I certainly was when I was invited to cover the work of the team.\nI quickly discover why as I try to get there myself.\nSnow on the ice runway delays my flight from New Zealand to McMurdo, the main US research station in Antarctica.\nThis is the first of a whole catalogue of delays and disruptions.\nIt takes the science teams weeks just to get to their field camps.\nAt one stage, the entire season's research is on the point of being cancelled because storms stop all flights to West Antarctica from McMurdo for 17 consecutive days.\nWest Antarctica is the stormiest part of the world's stormiest continent.\nAnd Thwaites is remote even by Antarctic standards, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from the nearest research station.\nOnly four people have ever been on the front of the glacier before and they were the advance party for this year's work.\nBut understanding what is happening here is essential for scientists to be able to predict future sea level rise accurately.\nThe ice in Antarctica holds 90% of the world's fresh water, and 80% of that ice is in the eastern part of the continent.\nThe ice in East Antarctica is thick - more than a mile thick on average - but it rests on high ground and only creeps sluggishly to the sea.\nSome of it has been around for millions of years.\nWestern Antarctica, however, is very different. It is smaller but still huge, and is much more vulnerable to change. \nUnlike the east it doesn't rest on high ground. In fact, virtually the whole bed is way below sea level. If it weren't for the ice, it would be deep ocean with a few islands.\nI've been in Antarctica five weeks before I finally board the red British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter that takes me to the front of the glacier.\nI will be camping with the team at what is known as the grounding zone.\nThey are camped on the ice above the point where the glacier meets the ocean water, and have the most ambitious task of all.\nThey want to drill down through almost half a mile of ice right at the point where the glacier goes afloat.\nNo-one has ever done that on a glacier this big and dynamic.\nThey will use the hole to get access to the sea water that is melting the glacier to find out where it is from and why it is attacking the glacier so vigorously.\nThey do not have long.\nAll the delays mean there are just a few weeks of the Antarctic summer left before the weather starts to get really bad.\nAs the members of the drilling team set up their equipment, I help out with a seismic survey of the bed beneath the glacier.\nDr Kiya Riverman, a glaciologist at the University of Oregon, drills down with an ice auger - a large spiral stainless-steel drill bit - and sets small explosive charges.\nThe rest of us dig holes in the ice for the \"georods\" and \"geophones\" - the electronic ears that listen to the echo of the blast that bounces back from the bedrock through the layers of water and ice.\nThe reason the scientists are so worried about Thwaites is because of that downward sloping submarine bed.\nIt means the glacier gets thicker and thicker as you go inland.\nAt its deepest point, the base of the glacier is more than a mile below sea level and there is another mile of ice on top of that.\nWhat appears to be happening is that deep warm ocean water is flowing to the coast and down to the ice front, melting the glacier.\nAs the glacier retreats back, yet more ice is exposed.\nIt is a bit like cutting slices from the sharp end of a wedge of cheese.\nThe surface area of each one gets bigger and bigger - providing ever more ice for the water to melt.\nAnd that is not the only effect.\nGravity means ice wants to be flat. As the front of the glacier melts, the weight of the vast reservoir of ice behind it pushes forward.\nIt wants to \"smoosh out,\" explains Dr Riverman. The higher the ice cliff, she says, the more \"smooshing\" the glacier wants to do.\nSo, the more the glacier melts, the more quickly the ice in it is likely to flow.\n\"The fear is these processes will just accelerate,\" she says. \"It is a feedback loop, a vicious cycle.\"\nDoing science of this scale in such an extreme environment is not just about flying a few scientists to a remote location.\nThey need tonnes of specialist equipment and tens of thousands of litres of fuel, as well as tents and other camping supplies and food.\nI camped on the ice for a month, some of the scientists will be out there for far longer, two months or more.\nIt took more than a dozen flights by the US Antarctic programme's fleet of huge ski-equipped Hercules cargo planes just to get the scientists and some of their cargo to the project's main staging post in the middle of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nThen smaller planes - an elderly Dakota and a couple of Twin Otters - ferried the people and supplies on to the field camps, hundreds of miles down the glacier towards the sea.\nThe distances are so great they needed to set up another camp halfway down the glacier so the planes could refuel.\nThe British Antarctic Survey's contribution was an epic overland journey that brought in hundreds of tonnes of fuel and cargo.\nTwo ice-hardened ships docked alongside an ice cliff at the foot of the Antarctic Peninsula during the last Antarctic summer.\nA team of drivers in specialist snow vehicles then dragged it more than a thousand miles across the ice sheet through some of the most inhospitable terrain and weather on earth.\nIt was tough going, the top speed was just 10mph.\nThe scientists at the grounding zone camp plan to use hot water to drill their hole through the ice.\nThey need 10,000 litres of water, which means melting 10 tonnes of snow.\nEveryone sets to work with spades, hefting snow into the \"flubber\" - a rubber container the size of a small swimming pool.\n\"It'll be the most southerly jacuzzi in the world,\" jokes Paul Anker, a British Antarctic Survey drilling engineer.\nThe principle is simple - you heat the water with a bank of boilers to just below boiling point and then spray it onto the ice, melting your way down.\nBut drilling a 30cm hole through almost half a mile of ice at the front of the most remote glacier in the world is not easy.\nThe ice is about -25C (-13F) so the hole is liable to freeze over and the whole process is dependent on the vagaries of the weather.\nBy early January, the flubber is full and all the equipment is ready but then we get a warning that yet another storm is on its way.\nAntarctic storms can be very intense. It is not unusual to have hurricane force winds as well as very low temperatures.\nThis one is relatively mild for Antarctica but still involves three days of wind gusting up to 50mph. It blows huge drifts of snow into the camp, swamping the equipment, and all the work stops.\nWe sit in the mess tent playing cards and drinking tea and the scientists discuss why the glacier is retreating so rapidly.\nThey say what is happening here is down to the complex interplay of climate, weather and ocean currents.\nThe key is the warm seawater, which originates on the other side of the world.\nAs the Gulf Stream cools between Greenland and Iceland, the water sinks. \nThis water is salty, which makes it relatively heavy, but is still a degree or two above freezing.\nThis heavy salty water is carried by a deep ocean current called the Atlantic conveyor all the way down to the south Atlantic.\nHere it becomes part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, flowing deep - a third of a mile (530m) - below a layer of much colder water.\nThe surface water in Antarctica is very cold, just above -2C degrees, the freezing point of salt water.\nThe deep warm circumpolar water travels all the way around the continent but has been increasingly encroaching on the icy edge of West Antarctica.\nThis is where our changing climate comes in.\nThe scientists say the Pacific Ocean is warming up and that is shifting wind patterns off the coast of West Antarctica, allowing the warm deep water to well up over the continental shelf.\n\"The deep Antarctic circumpolar water is only a handful of degrees warmer than the water above it - a degree or two above 0C - but that's warm enough to light this glacier up,\" says David Holland, an oceanographer with New York University and one of the lead scientists at the grounding zone camp.\nI was supposed to leave Antarctica at the end of December but all the delays mean the drilling only begins on 7 January.\nThat is when the satellite phone call comes from the United States Antarctic Program HQ in McMurdo.\nWe are told we cannot delay our flights off the continent any longer and must leave on the supply plane that is due to arrive at the camp in an hour or so.\nIt is very frustrating to be forced to leave before the hole is finished and the instruments have been deployed, especially given how long it took to get here.\nWe say our goodbyes and board the plane.\nI look back and see the wheel at the top of the drill turning, the black hose spooling out steadily.\nThey are almost half way down through the ice.\nThe plane flies up over the camp and directly north, out towards the ocean. \nThe scientists had told me that we had been camped on what is basically a small bay of ice protected by a horseshoe of raised ground.\nAs we fly out over the front of the glacier, I realise with a shock just how fragile a fingerhold it is.\nThere is no mistaking the epic forces at work here, slowly tearing, ripping and shattering the ice.\nIn some places the great sheet of ice has broken up completely, collapsing into a jumble of massive icebergs which float in drunken chaos. \nElsewhere, there are cliffs of ice, some of which rise up almost a mile from the sea bed.\nThe front of the glacier is almost 100 miles wide (160km) and is collapsing into the sea at up to two miles (3km) a year.\nThe scale is staggering and explains why Thwaites is already such an important component of world sea level rise, but I am shocked to discover there is another process that could accelerate its retreat even more.\nMost glaciers that flow into the sea have what is known as an \"ice pump\".\nSea water is salty and dense which makes it heavy. Melt water is fresh and therefore relatively light.\nAs the glacier melts, the fresh water therefore tends to flow upwards, drawing up the heavier warmer sea water behind it.\nWhen the sea water is cold, this process is very slow, the ice pump usually just melts a few dozen centimetres a year - easily balanced by the new ice created by falling snow.\nBut warm water transforms the process, according to the scientists.\nEvidence from other glaciers shows that if you increase the amount of warm water that is reaching the glacier the ice pump works much faster.\n\"It can set glaciers on fire,\" says Prof Holland, \"increasing melt rates by as much as a hundred-fold.\"\nThe small plane takes us to the camp in the middle of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet but more bad weather means more delays and it is nine days before a Hercules comes to take us back to McMurdo.\nBy then we have been joined by some of the scientists.\nIt has been a very successful season.\nThey have confirmed that the deep circumpolar warm water is getting under the glacier and have collected huge amounts of data.\nIcefin, the robot submarine, has managed to make five missions, taking a host of measurements in the water beneath the glacier and recording some extraordinary images.\nIt will take years to process all the information the team has gathered and incorporate the findings into the models that are used to project future sea level rise.\nThwaites is not going to vanish overnight - the scientists say it will take decades, possibly more than a century.\nBut that should not make us complacent.\nA metre of sea level rise may not sound much, particularly when you consider that in some places the tide can rise and fall by three or four metres every day.\nBut sea level has a huge effect on the severity of storm surges, says Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey.\nTake London.\nAn increase in sea level of 50cm would mean the storm that used to come every thousand years will now come every 100 years.\nIf you increase that to a metre then that millennial storm is likely to come once a decade.\n\"When you think about it, we shouldn't be surprised by any of this,\" says Prof Vaughan as we are preparing to board the plane that will take us back to New Zealand and then home.\nEver-increasing carbon dioxide levels are putting a lot more heat into the atmosphere and the oceans. \nHeat is energy, and energy drives the weather and ocean currents.\nIncrease the amount of energy in the system, he says, and inevitably big global processes are going to change. \n\"They already have in the Arctic,\" says Prof Vaughan with a sigh. \"What we are seeing here in the Antarctic is just another huge system responding in its own way.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366", "title": "Coronavirus: How worried should we be?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:30:04 GMT", "summary": "Tens of thousands of people have been infected with a newly-discovered virus.", "story": "A virus - previously unknown to science - is causing severe lung disease in China and has also been detected in other countries.\nPeople are known to have died and the outbreak shows no sign of stopping soon. \nA new virus arriving on the scene, leaving patients with pneumonia, is always a worry and health officials around the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency. \nCan this outbreak be contained or is this something far more dangerous?\nOfficials in China have confirmed the cases are caused by a coronavirus. \nThese are a broad family of viruses, but only six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people. \nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which is caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002.\n\"There is a strong memory of Sars, that's where a lot of fear comes from, but we're a lot more prepared to deal with those types of diseases,\" says Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust.\nIt seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath and some patients needing hospital treatment. \nThe World Health Organization says data from 17,000 patients suggests 82% have mild disease, 15% are severe and 3% critical.\nNotably, the infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose or sneezing.\nThe coronavirus family itself can cause symptoms ranging from a mild cold all the way through to severe lung problems, which can kill.\nWhile the ratio of deaths to known cases appears low, the figures are unreliable.\nIt is far too simplistic to divide the number of deaths by the number of cases to calculate the death rate to get a figure of around 2% at this stage of the outbreak.\nThousands of patients are still being treated and we do not know if any of those cases will die - so the death rate could be higher. \nAnd it is unclear how many unreported mild cases are out there - so the death rate could also be lower.\nThis virus is not really \"new\" - it is just new to humans, having jumped from one species to another.\n\"If we think about outbreaks in the past, if it is a new coronavirus, it will have come from an animal reservoir,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. \nMany of the early coronavirus cases were linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan. \nSars started off in bats and then infected the civet cat, which in turn passed it on to humans. \nAnd Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which has killed 858 out of the 2,494 recorded cases since it emerged in 2012, regularly makes the jump from the dromedary camel.\nWhile some sea-going mammals can carry coronaviruses (such as the Beluga whale), the South China Seafood Wholesale Market also had live wild animals, including chickens, rabbits, snakes, which are more likely to be the source. \nThe new virus is closely related to one found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\nHowever, South China Agriculture University has suggested the virus could have moved from bats to pangolins and finally to humans. \nTwo reasons - people coming into close contact with animals harbouring viruses and dense urban populations that allow it to spread. \n\"No-one is surprised the next outbreak is in China or that part of the world,\" says Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh.\nIt largely spreads when infected people cough droplets containing the virus into the air that infect those nearby.\nInitially, the Chinese authorities said the virus was not spreading between people.\nBut now we know each infected person is passing the virus on to between two and three other people.\nThis figure is the basic reproduction number of the virus - anything higher than one means the virus is self-sustaining.\nIn other words, this is not an outbreak that will burn out on its own and disappear.\nMostly when people are coughing, however, Chinese scientists have suggested some people may be infectious even before their symptoms appear. \nThe time between infection and symptoms - known as the incubation period - lasts up to 14 days. \nSars and Ebola are contagious only when symptoms appear. Such outbreaks are relatively easy to stop: identify and isolate people who are sick and monitor anyone they came into contact with.\nBut \"symptomless spreaders\" are much harder to stop. \nThere are thousands of new cases being reported each day.\nHowever, outbreak analysts believe these are only the tip of the iceberg.\nTheir mathematical models suggest the true scale of the outbreak could be 10 times larger than the official figures. \nMultiple groups have estimated the number of cases is doubling every five to seven days. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says the virus is a public health emergency of international concern - as it did with swine flu and Ebola.\nIt said it has done so in order to provide extra support to lower and middle-income countries with weaker health systems that might not be able to spot or isolate cases of coronavirus.\nThe virus seems to be quite stable, so far.\nHowever, it is possible for viruses to mutate and that is something scientists will be watching closely.\nThe World Health Organization say the outbreak can be contained, but this is not a universally shared view.\nExperts, including the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control, argue the virus could become a pandemic - a global epidemic.\nThe only way it can be stopped is to prevent people who have become infected from spreading the virus to others. \nThat means:\nA massive feat of detective work will also be needed to identify people who have been in close contact with patients to see if they have the virus.\nNo.\nHowever, the work to develop them is already under way and it is hoped there will be human trials before the end of the year. \nAnd hospitals are testing anti-viral drugs to see if they have an impact. \nA combination of two drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - was successful in the Sars epidemic and is being tested in China during this outbreak.\nBut at the moment, treatment relies on the basics - keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight the virus off.\nColds and flu tend to do their main business in the winter months, so there is hope that the turning of the seasons may help stem the outbreak. \n\"Schools are closed for a long time in the summer and that helps limit the spread of many of these respiratory infections,\" said Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nHowever, Mers-coronavirus emerged in the summer in Saudi Arabia. \n\"These viruses can certainly spread during the high temperature seasons, but the extent of the spread is what's important,\" said Prof David Heymann.\nChina has done something unprecedented anywhere in the world - effectively putting entire cities into quarantine.\nThe central province of Hubei, which includes Wuhan, is in lockdown with around 60 million people affected. \nBeijing has banned group dining for events such as birthdays and weddings while cities such as Hangzhou and Nanchang are limiting how many family members can leave home each day.\nHubei province has even switched off lifts in high-rise buildings to discourage residents from going outside.\nDr Golding says: \"At the moment, until we have more information, it's really hard to know how worried we should be.\n\"Until we have confirmation of the source, that's always going to make us uneasy.\"\nProf Ball says: \"We should be worried about any virus that explores humans for the first time, because it's overcome the first major barrier.\n\"Once inside a [human] cell and replicating, it can start to generate mutations that could allow it to spread more efficiently and become more dangerous. \n\"You don't want to give the virus the opportunity.\"on Twitter.\nUse this form to ask your question: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51296585": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51296585", "title": "Capella Space radar company chases persistent vision", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 17:00:12 GMT", "summary": "The American start-up Capella says it's now ready to deploy its fleet of all-weather Earth observers.", "story": "When one of your \"companies to watch\" goes quiet for a period of time, you begin to wonder what's going on. \n\"Have you heard from Capella Space recently? Weren't they supposed to have launched more satellites by now?\" I asked a journalist colleague in December. \"Yeah, I was thinking the exact same thing,\" she replied. \nAnd then up pops the US company and all is explained. \"Ah, so that's what they've been doing.\" Capella is developing a commercial constellation of small, low-cost Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. These will be capable of sensing the Earth's surface in all weathers, day or night. \nIt's an activity that has traditionally been dominated by Big Government - the national space agencies and the military - because of the expense and complexity of doing radar from orbit. \nBut the technologies being exploited now by so-called \"New Space\" companies are challenging the old ways of doing things. \nCapella put up one 48kg \"demonstrator\" spacecraft called Denali in late 2018 and was expecting to follow that with two more operational platforms in 2019 and a further 12 in 2020. \nWith this gradual roll-out would have come steadily improving performance. \nBut then, as CEO Payam Banazadeh told me, a few hands started to go up from prospective customers who said they'd rather skip straight to the better quality images of the later satellites. \nAnd so the company took the difficult decision to halt its roll-out and bring forward future upgrades. Hence the period of quiet in 2019 as Capella sought to rebuild its next batch of satellites. \n\"We heard the market,\" the former Nasa engineer said. \"Our initial customers will be in defence and intelligence, and they're hooked on high quality and high resolution. And so we need to be sure that from the get-go, we are known for that as well. \n\"Because we've seen it before with other players - it's very difficult to change customers' perception of you after you've already given them a product. You'll be flagged and known for that product, whatever that is, even if your next iteration is much improved.\" \nLast week, at the Global Geospatial Intelligence Conference in London, Capella revealed details of its new spacecraft. They're bigger (although still under 100kg) and with greater performance. They should now deliver narrow strip scenes of Earth up to 4,000km in length at a ground resolution of 50cm - and better, down to 30cm for US government-approved customers.\nThe first satellite in this new batch, Sequoia (named after another US National Park), is booked onto a SpaceX rocket for a March lift-off. The hope then is to get another six up before the year's end. However, this will depend strongly on launcher availability.\nI've written quite a bit recently about the European \"competitor\" to Capella - the Finnish company Iceye. Both are trying to break the mould by opening a market for persistent radar imaging where the same spot on the Earth's surface is imaged every hour or so. It's achieved by having multiple spacecraft flying overhead - 36 in the case of Capella; 18 in the case of Iceye. \nI say \"competitor\", but in truth these companies seem to be focussing in different areas at the moment. If Capella is going to major on defence and intelligence, Iceye is building a reputation in the maritime sector. Evidence of this is the new service Iceye is offering to find ships that try to hide illegal activity, such as unregulated fishing. \nBut such is the newness of what both companies are doing, they probably need their combined efforts right now to build better awareness of what SAR is all about. \nWorking in the news business, I certainly recognise this. Satellites that can see the Earth's surface even through thick cloud and in the dark are first with those pictures of the volcano that's just blown its top or the oil tanker that's been attacked in the Gulf. \nBut there will be many commercial sectors that simply haven't clocked yet what SAR can do for them. \nOne other issue before I close. You'll probably have seen the kerfuffle surrounding the constellation of Starlink broadband satellites being launched by SpaceX. \nTheir brightness in the sky has caught the ire of astronomers who worry these artificial points of light will impede their view of the cosmos. \nThe SAR constellations haven't escaped this scrutiny, although the questions being asked take a different tack. \nAt the recent American Astronomical Society meeting in Hawaii, Dr Harvey Liszt from the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory raised the concern that powerful radar pulses from orbit could damage the radio receivers that scientists employ in their ground observatories.\nPayam Banazadeh told me Capella was taking this matter very seriously and was keen to co-ordinate his company's activities with the AAS. \n\"We have also been in contact with Dr Liszt and are actively working to safeguard their mission when operating our SAR constellation. \n\"Whether it is observing Earth or deep space, Capella believes in exploration and scientific discovery. We also believe in and support protecting the mission of the radio astronomy community.\"  @BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49836270": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-49836270", "title": "Nambi Narayanan: The fake spy scandal that blew up a rocket scientist\u2019s career", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:01:02 GMT", "summary": "Falsely charged with selling secrets to Pakistan, Nambi Narayanan's life was knocked off course.", "story": "One winter afternoon a quarter of a century ago three policemen arrived at a house in a narrow lane in the southern Indian city of Trivandrum, the capital of the state of Kerala.\nThe officers were polite and respectful, Nambi Narayanan remembers.\nThey told the space scientist that their boss, a deputy inspector general of police, wanted to talk to him.\n\"Am I under arrest?\" Mr Narayanan asked.\n\"No sir,\" the officer said. \nIt was 30 November 1994. The 53-year-old scientist led the Indian space agency's cryogenic rocket engine project, and was responsible for acquiring the technology from Russia. \nMr Narayanan walked out to the waiting police vehicle. He asked whether he should sit in the front or the back - suspects were usually dumped in the back seat.\nThe policemen asked him to sit in the front, and the Jeep rolled out of the lane.\nWhen they arrived at the police station, the boss wasn't there, so Mr Narayanan was asked to wait on a bench. Policemen gaped at him as they passed by.\n\"They had that look as if they were looking at someone who had done some crime,\" Mr Narayanan says. \nHe waited and waited. The boss didn't turn up.\nAs night fell, he dozed off on the bench. When he woke up next morning, he was told he was under arrest.\nA scrum of journalists had arrived, and within hours newspapers were describing him as a traitor - a man who had sold rocket technology to Pakistan, after falling into a honey trap set by two women from the Maldives. \nHis life was never the same again.\nNambi Narayanan was the first boy in a middle-class family, after five girls. His father was a businessman, trading in coconut kernel and fibre. His mother stayed at home to look after the children. \nYoung Nambi was a good student and topped his senior class. He went to an engineering school, got a degree and worked in a sugar factory for a while, before joining the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). \"I always had a fascination for aircrafts and flying objects,\" he says. \nAt the agency, he rose rapidly through the ranks until he won a scholarship to study rocket propulsion systems at Princeton University. He rejoined the space agency when he returned home a year later. \nAt Isro Mr Narayanan worked with the stalwarts of India's space programme: scientists like Vikram Sarabhai, its founder and first chairman, Satish Dhawan, his successor, and Abdul Kalam, who later became India's 11th president.\n\"When I began working with Isro, the space organisation was in its infancy. We never really had a plan of developing any rocket systems. We were planning to use rockets from the US and France to fly our payloads,\" Mr Narayanan says. \nBut the plan changed, and Mr Narayanan became a key figure in the project to develop homegrown Indian rockets.\nHe worked diligently as a scientist until his life was turned upside down in November 1994.\nA month before his arrest, the Kerala police had arrested a Maldivian woman, Mariam Rasheeda, on charges of overstaying her visa. Weeks later, they picked up her friend, Fauziyya Hassan, a bank worker visiting from Male, the capital of the Maldives. A major scandal then erupted.\nInspired by police leaks, local newspapers reported that the Maldivian women were spies stealing India's rocket \"secrets\" and selling them to Pakistan, in cahoots with scientists at the space agency. \nMr Narayanan, it was now claimed, was one of the scientists who had succumbed to the women's charms.\nThe day he was formally arrested, Mr Narayanan was produced in court.\n\"The judge asked me whether I would confess to the crime. I asked, 'What crime?' They said, 'The fact that you have transferred the technology.' I couldn't understand anything,\" he remembers.\nThe judge remanded him to judicial custody for 11 days. A memorable image from that time shows the scientist walking down the steps of the court building, dressed in a dark-coloured shirt and light grey trousers, surrounded by policemen.\n\"I was in a shock, and then a trance. At one instance it appeared to me that I was watching a movie - with me as the central character,\" Mr Narayanan wrote in his memoirs.\nOver the next few months, his dignity and reputation were torn to shreds. He was charged with violating India's official secrets law and corruption, among other things.\nHis interrogators beat him up and handcuffed him to a bed. They forced him to stand and answer questions for 30 hours on end. They made him take lie-detector tests even though the results are not admitted as evidence in Indian courts.\nThen they took him to a high security prison, where one of his co-prisoners was a \"serial killer\" who had bludgeoned his victims to death. (The man told Mr Narayanan that he had been reading about the case and that he could tell that the scientists were innocent.)\nMr Narayanan told the police that rocket secrets \"could not be transferred by paper\" and that he was clearly being framed. The fact that India was still struggling to obtain cryogenic technology to make powerful rocket engines didn't cut any ice with the detectives.\nIn the end, Mr Narayanan spent 50 days in captivity - including nearly a month in prison. Whenever he was taken to a court hearing, crowds appeared shouting that he was a spy and a traitor.\nBut a month after his arrest India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the case from Kerala's Intelligence Bureau. Mr Narayanan told federal detectives that none of the information he dealt with was classified. \"I don't know how this whole thing has come to this stage. We are terribly sorry,\" one detective told him.\nAfter finally securing bail on 19 January 1995, he arrived home shortly before midnight.\nHe went upstairs to break the news to his wife. She was sleeping on the floor in a dark room, and responded only after he called out her name twice.\n\"She turned around slowly, raised her head and stayed still, staring into my eyes. She had a strange expression, as if she was watching me doing something horrible,\" Mr Narayanan recounted later. \n\"Then she let out a shriek that I had never heard - from a human or an animal.\"\nThe cry coursed through the house. Then she fell silent.\nHer husband's incarceration and absence had severely affected Meenakshi Ammal's mental health. The couple had been married for nearly three decades and had brought up two children together, but after Mr Narayanan's arrest the austere temple-going woman had slipped into depression and stopped talking.\nApart from Mr Narayanan, five others had also been accused of espionage and transferring rocket technology to Pakistan. One was his colleague at Isro, D Sasikumaram; there was also Ms Rasheeda and her friend (neither of whom Mr Narayanan had met, before he was arrested); and two other Indian men, an employee of the Russian space agency and a contractor. \n1994 - Narayanan arrested and remanded in custody, then bailed in January 1995\n1996 - Exonerated by the Central Bureau of Investigation\n1998 - Supreme Court finally dismisses Kerala government's appeal\n2001 - Kerala government ordered to pay compensation\n2018 - Supreme Court orders investigation into fabrication of case \nIn 1996, the CBI's final 104-page report exonerated all of them. Federal detectives said there was no evidence of any confidential documents being stolen from the space agency and sold, or of money being exchanged for drawings of engines. An internal investigation by Isro also found that no drawings of the cryogenic engines were missing.\nMr Narayanan went back to work for Isro - though now in an admin role in Bangalore - but his travails hadn't come to an end. Even after the detectives closed the case, the local government tried to reopen it, and dragged in the Supreme Court, which finally dismissed the case in 1998.\nWhen Mr Narayanan sued the Kerala government for framing him, he was awarded five million rupees ($70,000; \u00a353,000). Last month, the government said it would \n rupees as compensation for his illegal arrest and harassment. \nBut from the 78-year-old's point of view, the story is not finished yet. In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into the role of the Kerala police in the fabrication of the case against him, and Mr Narayanan is keen to see the results. \"I want people who fabricated this case against me to be punished,\" he says. \"One chapter is over, but the next chapter is still there.\"\nThe motive for the plot against him and the five others remains a mystery. \nWas it a conspiracy by a rival space power - as Mr Narayanan suspects - to scuttle India's development of cryogenic rocket technology, which eventually became the backbone of the country's successes in space? Did it have to do with rivals who were nervous about India forcing its way into the commercial satellite launch market with competitive prices? Or was it purely a product of corruption with India itself?\n\"It was born out of one conspiracy. But the conspirators were different with different motives, and the victims were the same set of people,\" says Mr Narayanan.\n\"Whatever it is, my career, honour, dignity and happiness were lost. And the people who were responsible for this are still scot free.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nCan you guide a spacecraft into orbit around Mars and cook for eight people morning and night?

But just how green are your fingers? \nFrom cutting down on \"plant miles\" to reusing plastic pots, British gardeners, botanists and environmental campaigners have shared ways to keep your horticultural hobby sustainable.\nHouseplants are on the rise, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says average sales in the second half of last year were up 60% on the previous year. \nThe trend has been attributed to eco-friendly, health-conscious millennials who want to bring the great outdoors into their inner-city flats and nurture something \"real\" in an increasingly virtual world.\nAbout four in five 16 to 24-year-olds own at least one houseplant and a fifth of owners bought them to boost their health and wellbeing, a RHS survey suggests.\nIf they can get some good photos along the way, even better. The hashtag #plantsofinstagram has been used more than 4 million times.  \nWith the craze has sprung up a number of specialist online retailers that deliver straight to your door.\nPatch, which says it is London's biggest online plant retailer, is one example. It gives its plants nicknames like \"Chaz\" and \"Big Ken\" to endear them to prospective \"plant parents\".\nChief executive Freddie Blackett says that part of the appeal is that plants make people feel \"calmer, happier and more at ease\".\nPatch's plants are grown in the Netherlands and shipped to the UK as and when they are ordered, which avoids excess plants being shipped.\nBut ordering online could rack up \"plant miles\", says Fay Kenworthy, co-founder of PlantSwap, a Sheffield-based community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally.\n\"As many plants are brought in from overseas, their transportation represents a significant ecological footprint,\" she says, noting that while most come from Holland, orchids can be shipped from Indonesia and \"light-loving\" plants from Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\"You may have decided to reduce your international travel to protect the environment but your plants are still shipping across the world.\"\nShipping from abroad isn't too much of a concern for botanist and BBC presenter James Wong, the proud owner of 500 houseplants.\n\"You're going to be [ordering plants] on a much smaller scale compared to outdoors, so, by definition, it's going to have a lower carbon footprint,\" he says.\nHe argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car, and that \nHe adds that growing certain plants in hotter climates and shipping them to the UK can eliminate the need for heated greenhouses closer to home. \nHowever, Wong agrees that exchanging unwanted plants, cuttings, and seedlings at plant swaps is a sustainable option for houseplant buyers.\nAnother benefit, according to Ms Kenworthy, is that it avoids the excess packaging that comes with new plants - including plastic pots.\nPots can be a \"nightmare\" to recycle, says anti-plastic campaigner Amy Meek, 16.\nOnly about 10% of local authorities in the UK accept them, according to analysts at the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). \nSometimes they are not collected because they are considered contaminated. But many are also made from black plastic, which often cannot be detected by sorting machines at recycling centres, and so end up in landfill or incinerated.\nMany local authorities reject even non-black plastic pots, which has led to the development of more easily-recyclable many UK buyers live closer to Amsterdam than British-based suppliers. and even biodegradable pots.\nThe Horticultural Trades Association and RHS Gardens offer plant pot recycling or \"take back\" schemes, and B&Q says it is trialling a recycling scheme.\nMiss Meek, who runs environmental charity Kids Against Plastic with her younger sister, Ella, wants buyers to think about plants' packaging.\nShe encourages people to ask: \"Will I be able to  I use it again, or is there somewhere else I could look to buy these plants from that are using more sustainable packaging or one that could be used for longer?\"\nBut being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered  - it is also about what it is grown in. \nThe main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts. \nThe earthy substance, found in waterlogged areas in the UK, is made of decomposed plant matter and can take thousands of years to form. \n\"Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year,\" says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife.\nHe encourages people to check with retailers about the use of peat, or to stick to plants that don't need it, like orchids or cacti.\nBecause plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air.\nPhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove \"significant amounts\" of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil.\n\"The amount the plant is watered affects its ability to function and remove CO2, in the same way as with people - if you're dehydrated or have drunk too much water you will not function as well,\" he says.\nDracaena \"Golden Coast\" plants and peace lillies performed best in his research, but he says you'd still need to buy a lot of them - even installing a vertical garden or \"green wall\" - and have extra lighting in order for them to reduce CO2 levels.\nSo, are houseplants bad for the environment?\nWong says that everything we do has a carbon footprint and that, in the scheme of things, people shouldn't \"freak out\" about their environmental impact.\nHowever, he advises that if buyers want to be as sustainable as possible, they should talk to their suppliers about the use of peat, avoid buying houseplants that are \"designed to die\" like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti, and propagate plants from cuttings and seeds to offset any environmental concerns.\n\"Not that those things are a huge issue,\" he says. \"But every little bit helps.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51422970": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51422970", "title": "What do a coyote and badger tell us about animal relations?", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 12:04:59 GMT", "summary": "A zoologist explains why footage showing the two animals working together, might be more common than you think.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51361582": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51361582", "title": "'A turtle inspired us to tackle plastic pollution'", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 06:39:51 GMT", "summary": "A couple who met while travelling say seeing the \"scary\" impact of rubbish spurred them into action.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-51357526": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-51357526", "title": "Portsmouth academic develops 'perfect espresso' formula", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 23:57:37 GMT", "summary": "A team of mathematicians and physicists say they have the formula for consistently good coffee.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51371250": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51371250", "title": "O'Neill: PM 'doesn't really get' climate change", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 09:42:08 GMT", "summary": "Former minister Claire O'Neill has said the prime minister \"doesn't really get\" climate change.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368482": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51368482", "title": "Sir David Attenborough: 'Now is the moment'", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 11:12:34 GMT", "summary": "The broadcaster and naturalist says the Glasgow climate summit later this year is \"extremely important\".", "story": ""}}, "technology": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360645": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360645", "title": "Portl's 'holoportation booth' lets users beam-in live and life-sized", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:57:25 GMT", "summary": "The projection display is able to show pre-recorded video or live images broadcast from another location.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51424352": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51424352", "title": "Facebook's Twitter and Instagram accounts hacked", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 03:09:04 GMT", "summary": "The social media giant restores its account after a Dubai-based hacking group temporarily took over.", "story": "Facebook's social media accounts were temporarily taken over by a group of hackers on Friday afternoon.\nThe hacking group OurMine posted on the Twitter and Instagram accounts for Facebook and Messenger, writing \"even Facebook is hackable\".\nThe accounts have now been restored.\nOurMine claims its attacks are an attempt to show cyber vulnerabilities.

The firm's founder has said he would \"shut the company down\" rather than aid \"any spying activities\".\nThese are not the first MPs to raise worries about Huawei's involvement in the 5G network.\nAnd the arguments they make were well-aired before the government decided to give the Chinese company up to a 35% share of the infrastructure project.\nBut the fact the six politicians - including four former cabinet ministers and the chair of the Commons defence committee - are continuing to battle against the plan, underscores that this remains a live issue.\nSo does the comment from the US vice president, Mike Pence, who told a US broadcaster he is \"profoundly\" disappointed with the decision to proceed with Huawei.\nHis \"we'll see\" answer to questioning on whether a UK-US trade deal will be jeopardised will also not go unnoticed by British officials.\nBut Downing Street doesn't wish to respond to the letter, save only to remind that Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he does want to reduce Huawei's involvement.\nHe didn't say by how much - and the government looks somewhat hamstrung by what it says is a lack of other companies able to step in to the breach.\nThe letter-writing MPs think other firms could be brought in and, in part, that's why they've written this letter, to get other parliamentarians on board and coming up with ideas on how to proceed.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51413724": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51413724", "title": "Apple fined for slowing down old iPhones", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:49:07 GMT", "summary": "Apple agrees to pay a \u00a321m fine in France for not making it clear that it slowed down old iPhones.", "story": "Apple has been fined 25 million euros (\u00a321m, $27m) for deliberately slowing down older iPhone models without making it clear to consumers.\nThe fine was imposed by France's competition and fraud watchdog DGCCRF, which said consumers were not warned.\nIn 2017, Apple confirmed that it did slow down some iPhones, but said it only did so to \"prolong the life\" of the devices.\nApple said in a statement that it had resolved the issue with the watchdog.\nMany customers had long suspected that Apple slowed down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade when a new one was released.\nIn 2017, the company confirmed it did slow down some models as they aged, but not to encourage people to upgrade.\nIt said the lithium-ion batteries in the devices became less capable of supplying peak current demands, as they aged over time.\nThat could result in an iPhone unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.\nSo, it released a software update for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE which \"smoothed out\" battery performance.\nThe practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged, but had suddenly speeded up again after the battery had been replaced.\nThe French watchdog said iPhone owners \"were not informed that installing iOS updates (10.2.1 and 11.2) could slow down their devices\".\nAs part of the agreement, Apple must display a notice on its French-language website for a month.\nIt says Apple \"committed the crime of deceptive commercial practice by omission\" and had agreed to pay the fine.\nYes.

it brings a whole new dynamic to esports.\"\nTitles like Counter Strike, League of Legends and DOTA 2 are traditionally perceived by the gaming industry to be the most prestigious esports, with more viewers, bigger prize money and a deeper heritage than their competitors. \nBut Call of Duty developers hope this new format and having home teams will make their league easier to follow and offer a point of difference from those titles to appeal to new fans as well as existing ones. \n\"Before you'd have esports organisations pick up teams to compete, but they weren't from a specific area or grounded to a specific place,\" Lottie explains.\n\"Fans were only getting behind teams that were really good, and you weren't getting people supporting Call of Duty teams outside the Top 4 and that was an issue.\n\"You want teams to be driven to success by the fans and that wasn't really happening before.\"\nEsports organisations have each reportedly paid around \u00a320 million pounds to run a team in this new-look Call of Duty League. \nTen are based in North America with The London Royal Ravens and Paris Legion representing Europe. \nThe London team is made up of Rhys 'Rated' Price, Bradley 'Wuskin' Marshall, Dylan 'Dylan' Henderson, Mathew 'Skrapz' Marshall and Jordan 'Jurd' Crowley and will be hoping to use their home advantage to come out on top at this event.\nLeague play will continue throughout the year before a single team is crowned the champions later in the summer. \nLottie will be following the teams the whole way: \"I see myself as the glue of the broadcast team, as a storyteller and narrator.\n\"I can be a bit bossy sometimes but I'm there really to help the viewers get a sense of the excitement of each event. \n\"We want you to fall in love with what we're showing you, and the teams that are competing, so I'm trying to tell their stories whilst giving the analysts time to share their expert views on the action too.\"Instagram.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51410700": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51410700", "title": "Coronavirus: iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to make masks", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:58:57 GMT", "summary": "The world's biggest electronics maker aims to produce two million surgical masks a month.", "story": "Electronics giant Foxconn, maker of the Apple iPhone, is taking the unusual step of switching part of its production to making surgical masks.\nThe firm is also pushing to be allowed to reopen its regular production lines making electronics, which have been closed due to the coronavirus.\nThe outbreak has seen demand for masks soar and caused a shortage of supplies around the world.\nFoxconn aims to produce two million masks a day by the end of the month.\n\"In this war against the epidemic, every second counts,\" the firm said on the social media platform WeChat.\n\"The earlier we take precautionary actions, the earlier we can prevent the virus, the earlier we can save lives, the sooner we can overcome this.\" \nAs well as the iPhone, Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, makes parts and consumer electronics products including the iPad, Amazon's Kindle, and PlayStations.  \nThe company said it had already started test production of masks at its flagship manufacturing plant in Shenzhen in southern China.\nThe masks would in the first instance be to protect its workers from infection, something that the firm believes: \"is not just Foxconn's biggest corporate responsibility, but also our social responsibility\".\nOnce full production had started it would start providing masks to people outside the company, it added.\nThe firm also said that it would use a new generation of infrared temperature measurement equipment at its facilities to help detect any potential coronavirus infections in its workforce.\nLike other companies, Foxconn responded to the outbreak by closing most of its operations during the Lunar New Year break.

Not because he is past his prime, but because - he alleges - he's been \"shadow banned\" for uploading videos on Hindu-Muslim brotherhood on the popular video creation and sharing platform. \nShadow banning is the act of partially blocking content so it doesn't reach the platform's entire community of users. It will not be obvious to the user that the creator's content is not being promoted. \nTikTok has traditionally shied away from political subjects, but Mr Barman built a strong following of just under a million by performing and uploading 15 second skits on the theme of Hindu-Muslim unity at a time when many in India fear the two communities are being driven further apart. His most popular offering garnered more than 2.5 million views.\nIn one of the videos, Mr Barman is dressed as a Muslim man wearing a white prayer cap who is being carried by a Hindu man as harmonious music plays in the background. In another popular skit, he is dressed as a Muslim writer from Pakistan who is in India to research a book and is greeted and hosted by two gleeful Hindu strangers.\nThe fact that a young Hindu man from the Indian city of Bhopal was uploading videos promoting brotherhood and peace between Hindus and Muslims captured significant attention, earning him the moniker of top \"humanity\" content creator.\nBut over the past four months, TikTok India has been restricting the reach of his account to stay away from such \"risky\" content, he says, adding that he has lost some 25,000 followers since the end of October.  \nIn particular, his videos were no longer suggested on the front page, where TikTok gives tailored recommendations of creators and hashtags for users to discover. \n\"My videos used to get an average of 200,000 views but it's now down to 8,000 views. None of my videos show up on the 'For You' page,\" Mr Barman says.\nHe says his account started losing prominence last year, around the time a backlash began against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) - a controversial law which offers Indian citizenship to non-Muslims fleeing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\nThe law sparked fears it would marginalise India's Muslim minority, triggering protests. In the past few months, many of TikTok's 200 million Indian users have posted skits and songs on the app to voice their own opposition. \nThousands of these profess \"unity\" between people of different faiths under an umbrella of hashtags around the CAA, and have gathered millions of views. \nBut many are now worried after Mr Barman alleged he was shadow-banned. They wonder if they may be next. \n\"I was inspired by many of Mr Barman's videos that talk about brotherhood between Hindus and Muslims,\" said Mirza Ateeque Baig, a 16-year-old user.\nMirza shot to fame with a video viewed more than 4.8 million times, positioning politicians as the culprits dividing communities amid the backdrop of the citizenship law protests. \nHe says he was \"scared\" to upload it at first. \"I thought about it for 15 minutes. They [TikTok] don't want anything political that will impact them.\"\nTikTok India said it does not restrict any political content unless it violates its community guidelines. \nWhile the app does ban accounts for serious violations like pornography or hate speech, content it sees as a \"lesser infringement\" of its guidelines is left up on the app - but partially limited across user feeds.\nThis kind of \"limiting\" or shadow banning leaves creators in a bind - they are unsure if their content is being censored for violating guidelines, or whether it was simply not good enough to be promoted.\nBut then, users point to other evidence of people being blocked or \"shadow banned\" for political reasons by the app.\nIn the past few months the social media platform, owned by China's ByteDance, has been called out for allegedly censoring so-called \"risky\" content. Most recently, it faced massive backlash in the US for blocking a teenager's account after she uploaded a video accusing China of putting Muslims into \"concentration camps\".  TikTok later issued an apology and reinstated her account.  \nMeanwhile, a recent report in The Guardian revealed that Bytedance had policies in place that outright censored \"politically sensitive\" content relating to US President Donald Trump and criticism of China's socialist system. \nIn Turkey, the company was found to be censoring content that showed the LGBT community or same-sex relationships in a positive light. It has since updated its policies. \nHowever, TikTok has reason to be cautious in India. Police bought a case against unidentified TikTok influencers for hate speech over a video that sought revenge for a victim of mob lynching, and the app was temporarily banned in the country last year when a court decided it was encouraging pornography. \nTiktok told the BBC it had temporarily suspended Mr Barman's account because he was seen wearing a t-shirt with a drug reference in several of his videos. \"This should not have been a violation, and we have reinstated the videos accordingly,\" the company added.\n\"Our guidelines are clear that political content is allowed on TikTok, as long as it does not include extremist content, such as hate speech,\" a TikTok spokesperson said. \"All users have the opportunity to appeal violations, which the user had not done in this case.\" \nThe company, however, did not respond to Mr Barman's allegation that he had been \"shadow banned\".\nFor Mr Barman, the timing remains troubling. \"Since the censoring, I have made most of my Hindu-Muslim humanity videos private, hoping that TikTok will reverse the shadow ban.\" He has even abandoned his first account and started afresh, uploading only comedy content that steers clear of his usual themes.\nMr Barman's fans, meanwhile, have started an online campaign to reinstate his account, using the hashtag \"unfreeze\". They have made more than 700 videos.\nFree speech activists have also raised questions over the practice of shadow banning content on TikTok. \n\"They will have to be transparent about to what extent and technical ability they are boosting, de-prioritising and changing the ecology of experience for users and creators on the app,\" said Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.\nHe also pointed to the larger problem of censorship being algorithm-driven. In most cases, apps like TikTok tweak the platform in a way that matches their commercial interest over any interest in free expression, Mr Gupta added. \n\"We also now have a platform which has the communitarian ethos of China, which is risk averse to almost any kind of political commentary. TikTok doesn't recognise that in the territories it operates, politics is an everyday conversation.\" \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51304268": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51304268", "title": "Eating disorder used to sell diets on Instagram", "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 22:38:33 GMT", "summary": "Kara Henry explains how Instagram accounts are using images of her eating disorder to promote weight loss.", "story": "Instagram accounts are using images of a person recovering from an eating disorder to advertise weight loss.\nThe BBC has seen more than 30 accounts using the photos and some of them have more than a million followers.\nThe photos were taken by Kara Henry to document her journey of recovery from an eating disorder when she weighed just over four stone.\nHer images have been uploaded without her permission alongside claims that this shows successful weight loss.\nVisitors to the accounts using Ms Henry's images are urged to \"click the link in the bio\" to buy a tailored weight loss or diet plan to help achieve the results shown in the picture.\nInstagram has not responded to a request for comment.\nMs Henry told the BBC she estimates the images have been uploaded almost 100 times over the past three months, yet she was not able to get them removed.\n\"It's completely out of my control,\" she said. \"It's a picture of me being used completely out of context and inappropriately.\n\"It's being published to make it look like I'm going from a healthy weight to 60 pounds, with a message advertising a diet plan. It's outrageous, it's ridiculous.\n\"I keep reporting it and hoping for the best. I have a lot of people telling me they're reporting it too, and yet there seems to be no action from Instagram.\"\nSince the BBC contacted Instagram for a comment about the images, several of the offending posts have been removed, but many remain accessible.\nIn one instance uploaded on 6 January 2020 which has not been removed, the images have been liked more than 14,000 times and are accompanied by hashtags such as \"#ketodietlife, #howtoloseweight, and #extremeweightlossjourney\".\nMs Henry described the way she looked in one of the images as \"emaciated\" - and said its purpose was to document her recovery.\n\"When I posted those pictures I was in a different place in my recovery,\" she said. \"Now that I'm a little bit further along I think that picture isn't helpful even attached to a good message.\n\"I worry it makes people feel invalidated because their eating disorder doesn't look a certain way.

He was just surprised because he probably thought I was going to shake his hand.\n\"My dad actually didn't think I was going to do it.

Accies had no right to topple this Rangers team, despite the visitors' tepid start to 2020, but they gave it a good crack.\nTwo of the whippersnappers played pivotal roles in a helter-skelter first half. Rangers bossed it for the most part, Ianis Hagi heading a fraction wide from a Ryan Kent delivery, Kent blasting at Luke Southwood from distance, but Smith too spurned a fine chance on the breakaway.\nThen came the culmination of a brutal week for Jamie Hamilton. The teenage defender was turned by Morelos and in sheer desperation dived head-first at the feet of the Colombian. A red card against Celtic last Sunday, a blatant penalty shipped against Rangers - these been seven harsh days of learning for the young man.\nSouthwood flew to his right to block Arfield's spot-kick, but was unlucky to see the ball land back at the feet of the midfielder, who caressed casually into the net.\nAt that point, it looked like Rangers would run away with it. Southwood raced out to thwart Morelos, James Tavernier volleyed over after being played in by the striker, the excellent Hagi was a crafty menace.\nAnd then it got worse for Accies. Two injuries in two minutes - off went Steve Davies and Andy Dales; on came Marios Ogkmpoe and Mickel Miller. Oddly, the enforced switches jolted Hamilton into showing more intent in attack - the bulky Ogkmpoe brought a physicality and directness that Rangers did not know how to combat. \nSuddenly, they drew level. Ogkmpoe bamboozled Borna Barisic and George Edmundson, and teed up Smith right of goal, whose sumptuous low finish tricked across Allan McGregor and nestled in the bottom-left corner. \nPlay began to course from end to end, Ogkmpoe's square ball was deflected narrowly wide, Southwood fumbled and then just managed to smother a Hagi effort, then put Kent's walloped drive round a post. \nHamilton should have had a penalty when Goldson made an awful mess of a diving header, blocking a cross with a flailing left arm and then landing face-first on the ball. He got away with the gaffe.\nThen at the death, Miller flummoxed Barisic and was only denied by a terrific Glen Kamara cover tackle. The substitute was injured in the process and had to be substituted himself by Blair Alston.\nRangers reset and got a grip of the game after the break. It took Aribo's smart intervention to finally splinter Accies. The midfielder galloped into the box and clipped Kent's delivery into the bottom-right corner with a languid flick of his right boot. \nThen the flood gates opened. Morelos made Rangers' passage to the last eight safe with a predatory header five minutes from time after Greg Stewart's shot took a looping deflection and dropped for him six yards out. \nAnd then Arfield added a delicious finale, rattling in a thunderous drive off the underside of the crossbar from 25 yards. These were moments of class and ruthlessness that settled a testing tie.\nMatch ends, Hamilton Academical 1, Rangers 4.\nSecond Half ends, Hamilton Academical 1, Rangers 4.\nGoal!

Who wouldn't want to watch for a first look at Top Gun 2 or Fast & Furious 9?\"Belloni went further on the Media Masters podcast in 2018, saying: \"The fact that the Oscars are so boring is a colossal failure on the Academy's part.\n\"First of all there are 24 categories, most of which the average person does not care about. And they are presented with the exact same fanfare and exact same time allotted to each one of them.\n\"It's after midnight on the [US] east coast by the time they get to best picture, and they're running through it to get it done because they're already late. It is crazy.\"\nHe also thinks the Academy \"has been nominating films that fewer people are seeing\" in recent years.\n\"You don't see as many of the Titanic or Gladiator-style movies that win best picture any more. It's smaller films, films with niche audiences.\"\nThat means, he says, that \"there's less of an incentive for viewers to tune in, because they don't feel like they have a horse in the race\".\nThree-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker, whose working life is spent deciding how to best present film footage, also had some ideas for the ceremony.\n\"Frankly I don't watch it unless one of our people is nominated,\" she told BBC News.\nBut the veteran editor suggests \"it could be shorter probably [with] shorter speeches\". \n\"There's so many thank yous that everybody does - to their agent, their this, their that. That, I think, is not as meaningful to most of the audience as it is obviously to the people they're thanking.\n\"Maybe the speeches could be more about the work - you know, the art of it.\"\nIn 2018, host Jimmy Kimmel was so keen to cut down the speeches he gave a jet ski to the winner who spoke for the least amount of time.\n\"I have a stopwatch,\" he told that year's nominees. \"Why waste precious time thanking your mom when you could be taking her for the ride of her life on a brand new jet ski?\"\nPhantom Thread costume designer Mark Bridges ended up with the $18,000 (\u00a313,800) vehicle, which he donated to charity.\nSchoonmaker, who is up for an Oscar this year for The Irishman, noted that when she attended the recent American Cinema Editors awards, the speeches were top notch. \n\"I was very impressed. They were very moving speeches. There was hardly any of the endless, endless list of thanking. The speeches were short and it was a very good ceremony.\"\nPerhaps film editors have a thing or two to teach the rest of the movie industry when it comes to speaking succinctly. \nAnother suggestion came from The Big Picture podcast, which suggested the Academy should count down to the winning film by actually revealing the votes each best film nominee got.\nHosts Sean Fennessy and Amanda Dobbins, who'd seen the idea on Twitter, said this would make the ceremony \"much more fun\", adding that a ranking should be revealed \"every 15 or 20 minutes until you get to the final film - you have the elimination chamber of Oscars\". \nIn 2002, the Oscars awarded Halle Berry, Denzel Washington and 'A Beautiful Mind' in a ceremony that lasted 4 hours 23 minutes, the longest in TV history. The telecast averaged 42 million viewers. The length of the show isn't why the ratings have dropped.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @RaminSetoodeh\nOf course, the Oscars are not the only TV show facing declining audiences. Traditional TV as a whole is struggling to reach younger viewers.\n\"The hottest shows on TV networks - which command the highest ad prices - are attracting older viewers, which is a challenge for brands that want to reach millennials and teens,\" said the New York Times in 2018.\n\"As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook.\"\nSo what can be done to stem the exodus of award show viewers? \nThis year's Brit Awards are slimming down the number of winners from 12 to nine, compared with the Oscars' 24 categories.\nThe Brits are also promising \"more music\", with artists given full creative control of their performances. \nThe Baftas already edit their film awards ceremony down to a two-hour BBC broadcast.\nEven with new host Graham Norton, this year's event attracted an average  of 3.03m viewers, down from 2019's 3.5m - which in turn was 500,000 fewer than 2018.\nOscar watchers may recall that organisers tried to update the ceremony last year.\nThey wanted to include a popular films category, have fewer songs performed and to give awards including cinematography and editing during ad breaks.\nBut after objections from heavyweights including Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, the ad break decision was reversed.\nThe overall format remained the same - minus a host, after Kevin Hart resigned amid controversy over old homophobic tweets.\nNo doubt the Academy hopes another hostless ceremony could maintain or boost viewing figures - especially after Ricky Gervais's caustic hosting of last month's Golden Globes saw viewership drop 2% from 2019.\nSo was former host Johnny Carson right when he famously called the Oscars \"two hours of sparkling entertainment, spread out over a four-hour show\"?\nBBC News asked a group of students from the Los Angeles Film School what they thought.\nAs potential academy voters, and maybe even future winners, they were able to offer a youthful perspective - and their views were decidedly mixed. \nWhile most of them enjoyed the ceremony, they felt it was \"too long\", \"hasn't changed in years\" and \"doesn't captivate younger audiences\". \nNone of them said it should be hostless.\nThe ditching of the popular film category split opinion. Some said it would simply reward \"the movie that made the most money\" and was \"useless\" because \"the awards must be about quality\". \nBut others liked the idea, feeling it \"might attract the attention of younger viewers\" who are currently being courted by many parts of the media.\nCaptivating winners' speeches, such as Olivia Colman's last year, make for memorable moments, and some students love it when film-makers speak about their work or politics.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Oscars\n\"Movies are meant to move people, and the people making them have powerful voices and should speak for what they believe,\" said one.\nBut others believe \"overlong thank you's are the worst\", with one student stating: \"I don't care about Hollywood's opinion on politics.\"\nThere also was no consensus about consigning categories like editing to the ad breaks. One student argued these awards represented \"where the real skill is\", but another replied: \"It should be reported afterwards.\"\nBest song performances were a big hit with the students. After all, who could forget last year's steamy performance of Shallow by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper?\nOne remarked they \"loved\" the songs as \"they make the show feel more modern\", while another advocated reducing them all to a \"medley\".\nBBC News has also contacted Oscars organisers to see if they have any further plans for the ceremony.\nAccording to Matt Wolf from the International New York Times, Oscars organisers will \"incur outrage almost no matter what they do with the ceremony\".\n\"Even if five new preconditions were met, five more would emerge,\" said Wolf, who describes himself as a \"self-confessed Oscars nerd\". \nHe also thinks the organisers should televise all the categories, but said of the technical nominees: \"Mr and Mrs Middle America have no idea what they do.\"\nHe complained that \"all four acting winners are guessable this year in advance, which takes the suspense out of it.\n\"It's not the Oscars' fault, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Joaquin Phoenix, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern seem dead certs so the awards seem a bore.\"\nYet Wolf is sympathetic to the ceremony's organisers.\n\"The Oscars have become a very pliable punching bag; people can use it to vent their frustrations from all quarters. If they do A people want B; if they do Q people want Z.\"\nThe Oscars, he goes on, need to reflect all aspects of the ceremony. \"You want the garish dress on the red carpet as much as you want someone stunning and stellar. We need the package, warts and all. \n\"People love to complain about the Oscars, it's sort of a cultural sport, but the imperfections are what make them so glorious.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51422720": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51422720", "title": "Joe Wicks: Body Coach star to read Valentine's bedtime story", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:18:08 GMT", "summary": "The fitness coach is the latest star aiming to send children to sleep on CBeebies.", "story": "Body Coach star Joe Wicks is to read the CBeebies bedtime story on Valentine's Day, it has been announced.\nThe fitness coach and father-of-two will read Love Monster and the Perfect Present, by Rachel Bright.\nHe said he was excited to share the experience with daughter Indie, one, newborn son Marley and his nephews.\nWicks is the latest in a long list of stars, including Dolly Parton, Orlando Bloom, Alesha Dixon and Sir Elton John, to have read a story on the channel. \nThe 33-year-old said: \"One of my favourite things in the world is sitting down before bed and reading a new story with Indie.

I was getting to the point where I didn't like myself very much because I wasn't being honest with myself.\n\"[Coming out] is my decision. This is absolutely my decision. It was something I knew that I had to do. I don't know what the world will be like now. I don't know how this will be taken or what people will think.\"\nBut Schofield said he is not ready yet for a relationship with a man.\n\"You never know what's going on in someone's seemingly perfect life, what issues they are struggling with, or the state of their wellbeing - and so you won't know what has been consuming me for the last few years. With the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay. \n\"This is something that has caused many heart-breaking conversations at home. I have been married to Steph for nearly 27 years, and we have two beautiful grown-up daughters, Molly and Ruby. My family have held me so close - they have tried to cheer me up, to smother me with kindness and love, despite their own confusion. Yet still I can't sleep and there have been some very dark moments.\n\"My inner conflict contrasts with an outside world that has changed so very much for the better. Today, quite rightly, being gay is a reason to celebrate and be proud. Yes, I am feeling pain and confusion, but that comes only from the hurt that I am causing to my family. \n\"Steph has been incredible - I love her so very much. She is the kindest soul I have ever met. My girls have been astonishing in their love, hugs and encouraging words of comfort. Both my and Steph's entire families have stunned me with their love, instant acceptance and support. \n\"Of course they are worried about Steph, but I know they will scoop us both up. My friends are the best, especially Holly, who has been so kind and wise - and who has hugged me as I sobbed on her shoulder. At ITV, I couldn't hope to work with more wonderful, supportive teams.\n\"Every day on This Morning, I sit in awe of those we meet who have been brave and open in confronting their truth - so now it's my turn to share mine. This will probably all come as something of a surprise and I understand, but only by facing this, by being honest, can I hope to find peace in my mind and a way forward.\n\"Please be kind, especially to my family.\"\nSocial media was filled with support for Schofield after his announcement on Friday morning.\nThe BBC's Victoria Derbyshire added: \"So much love for Schofe for his open, honest, dignified statement.\"\nDancing on Ice star Ian H Watkins, who recently made history by dancing with his same-sex partner on the show, welcomed Schofield to \"our beautiful rainbow family!\"Richard Osman of BBC One's Pointless said: \"When you create a new entertainment show and start discussing who should host, the first name on the list is always Phillip Schofield. That's a fact. \n\"He's just the very best at what he does, and the public adore him. Looking forward to many more years of his charm and brilliance.\"\nSchofield found fame on children's TV in the 1980s alongside Gordon the Gopher in the BBC's Broom Cupboard, and on Saturday morning show Going Live!\nHe has starred in the West End in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Doctor Dolittle, and fronted TV game shows like Talking Telephone Numbers and Schofield's Quest before joining This Morning in 2002.\nThe programme has won at the National Television Awards for 10 years in a row, including the prize for best live magazine show at last month's ceremony. \nSchofield also presents a programme with his wife every December where they review Christmas gifts.\nEntertainment reporter Caroline Frost told BBC Radio 5 Live that stars from the previous generation were likely to have been told in the past that coming out as gay could damage their careers.\n\"You see all these young stars coming through and they don't have to think about it,\" she said. \"They're fluid. They just define their own terms.\n\"But a lot of those older entertainers are having to play catch-up. They branded themselves and were probably advised 'Don't come out because it will ruin your following'.\n\"So they are having to catch-up and climb back up the hill of enjoying the same privileges that have come very naturally to that new generation.\"\n\"Coming out\" is a moment which unites all LGBT people, whether they are eventually able to do it, or not. Some never will.  \nSocial media reactions show that this is being seen as an incredibly brave decision for Philip Schofield to make. Whilst Schofield is seen as a national treasure, and someone trusted with hearing deep and personal experiences on a daily basis, for him to become the story is wholly different. \nWhen someone with such a massive public platform comes out as LGBT, their entire life in the public eye is suddenly questioned, with some on-lookers inevitably claiming they \"knew all along\". In many cases, the person coming out may not have even known, let alone their family and friends. \nLGBT acceptance in the UK has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Whilst there are still issues, on the whole, people are much more free to be themselves than ever before. As a result, national LGBT charities such as the LGBT Foundation now offer tailored 'coming out' guidance to the growing numbers of LGBT people who are choosing to come out later in life, helping them navigate any barriers they may face.\nThis huge moment for Phillip Schofield may just be the green light that others need to come out themselves. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51419590": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51419590", "title": "The teenager who drew Billie Eilish for Vogue", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:30:06 GMT", "summary": "The Grammy-winner is officially a fan of 16-year-old Russian schoolgirl Anastasia Kovtun.", "story": "A portrait of Billie Eilish drawn by an aspiring Russian teenage artist is featured on one of four covers of the March edition of digital Vogue.\nAnastasia Kovtun, a 16-year old from a small town in the Urals, some 900 miles east of Moscow, was overwhelmed when the magazine contacted her to tell her that the singer herself picked out one of her drawings.\nAnastasia, or Nastya, who had showcased her art on social media, has spent three years at a drawing school but felt out of place there and eventually stopped going. She says she wanted to stay true to herself and did not want to transform her artistic style under pressure from instructors. \nThe Russian teenager is one of two lucky fans whose art was personally selected by Grammy-award-winning singer. The 16-year-old and Kylie Young, 20, from Michigan, both thought it was a practical joke when Vogue called. The former asked for proof - and so the magazine sent her a detailed description of the forthcoming edition, translated into Russian.\nNastya spoke to BBC Russian correspondent Maria Kornienko from the town of Chaykovsky (named after the great Russian classical music composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky) and explained she is a fan of Eilish because of her quirky, colourful and unique style.  \nShe says a phone call from Vogue was a surprise because she had not been on Instagram for long. \n\"I only opened an account in October last year. I know I am not a well-known or a recognised artist,\" she said. But she also knew that Billie Eilish had spotted her work.\n\"She liked two of my drawings in November,\" says Nastya. \"I was very inspired by that, Billie was the first famous person to express her opinion about my work.

It won't be easy but it will be worth it.\"\nBut what about the reaction on social media after she went back online?\n\"I try not to read comments where people say strange things,\" she explained. \"Such as that my drawing is only average. \n\"They think it is only luck that I was noticed for but I had worked so hard!

At every point, Kesha has either dropped her claims or lost in court, where matters of assault are difficult to prove. \nThursday's ruling (which you can read online) was another setback, with judge Schecter dismissing a number of Kesha's defence arguments.\nMost importantly, she made it easier for Gottwald's laywers to prove defamation by ruling that the producer was not a public figure or household name at the time of Kesha's allegations becoming public.\nIndividuals who are less well-known to the general public only have to prove that the defendant caused harm by making false claims, whereas public figures need to provide evidence of \"actual malice\" or \"gross irresponsibility\".\nThe judge made it clear she was not ruling on the factual question of whether Gottwald raped Kesha, saying that decision would be left to a jury.\nA jury will also have to decide whether the accusations made in Kesha's original court case were made \"in good faith of or as a sham to defame Gottwald and obtain business leverage\".\nHowever, the court also ruled that Gottwald had already \"met the heavy burden\" of establishing defamation in one specific instance - Kesha's 2016 text message to Lady Gaga, in which she said Katy Perry had been \"raped by the same man\".\n\"Perry unequivocally testified that Gottwald did not do so,\" wrote judge Schecter. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that Gottwald raped Katy Perry or that Katy Perry, whose sworn testimony is unrefuted, must not be believed.\"\nIn addition, the court dismissed Kesha's claim that her contract with Dr Luke's record label, Kemosabe, was unconscionable and fraudulent.\nKesha's new legal team responded to the judge's decisions by saying, \"We disagree with the Court's rulings. We plan to immediately appeal\".\nGottwald's lawyer said her client was looking forward to clearing his name at trial.\n\"Kesha abandoned her meritless case against Dr Luke more than three years ago,\" said Christine Lepera in a statement. \n\"The only remaining lawsuit is Dr Luke's case against Kesha for defamation and breach of contract. Dr Luke is pursuing this lawsuit to seek recovery for the serious harm Kesha's false accusations of rape have caused Dr Luke, his family and his business.\n\"Dr Luke looks forward to the trial of his case where he will prove that Kesha's other false statements about him were equally false and defamatory,\" she concluded.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51406557": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51406557", "title": "Joaquin Phoenix's unusual Oscar campaign", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:08:21 GMT", "summary": "The Joker actor's Oscar campaign has been political - using awards season to campaign for various causes.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51420130": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51420130", "title": "Oscars 2020: What's it like to be a nominee?", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:55:41 GMT", "summary": "The BBC's LA correspondent Sophie Long talks to talent from behind and in front of the camera.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51358376": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51358376", "title": "Cressida Cowell 'crossing fingers' for Oscar win", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 01:35:04 GMT", "summary": "The Children's Laureate hopes the third film to be based on her books receives an Academy Award.", "story": "One intriguing subplot at this year's Oscars can be found in the animated feature film category, where the third How To Train Your Dragon film is up against Toy Story 4.\nThere's previous here, as it was Toy Story 3 that stopped the first How To Train Your Dragon winning this award in 2011.\nHow To Train Your Dragon 2 also lost out in 2015 (to Big Hero 6), so this is the final opportunity for DreamWorks' fire-breathing franchise to take home an Oscar.\nSet in and around a Viking land called Berk, the series tells of a young warrior called Hiccup and his adventures with his loyal dragon Toothless.\nOne person who'll definitely be rooting for How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is Cressida Cowell, the British author (and Children's Laureate) whose books inspired the series.\n\"I so want them to get it, I can't tell you how much,\" she told BBC News last month. \"I'm crossing my fingers, I'm crossing my toes\u2026 I'm crossing absolutely everything.\n\"I could not be prouder of these movies and I really want them to get the Oscar they so deserve.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by DreamWorksTV\nAuthors aren't always pleased by adaptations of their books.

The slew of other awards ceremonies over several months was thought to be damaging interest in the Oscars, which mark the conclusion of awards season.\nOscar-ologists have been closely studying the nominations list for trends, patterns, quirks and clues about who might win what.\nShe is only the 12th person to receive two acting nominations in the same year.\nJohansson is nominated for both best actress and best supporting actress for her performances in Marriage Story and Jojo Rabbit respectively.\nThe other 11 people who've been nominated twice in acting categories at the same Oscars ceremony include Sigourney Weaver (in 1989), Al Pacino (1993), Emma Thompson (1994), Jamie Foxx (2005) and, most recently, Cate Blanchett (2008).\nBut none has ever won in both their categories.\nVery rarely does the winner of best actress also star in the winner of best picture - the last one who did was Hilary Swank in 2004's Million Dollar Baby.\nThat's unlikely to change this year.\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger is the favourite to win best actress for Judy, which isn't even his multi-use tux. for best picture.\nIn fact, if the Harriet star wins an Oscar to go with her Emmy, Grammy and Tony awards she'll become the youngest EGOT winner in history.\nThe 33-year-old would take over from the current record holder Robert Lopez, who completed the quad in 2018 at the age of 39.\nErivo has two chances to do this on Oscars night - because she's nominated for both best actress and best original song (she co-wrote Harriet's anthemic original song Stand Up.)\nThe newly-knighted Sir Sam first won in 2000 for American Beauty, but could triumph again at the 2020 ceremony with his hugely successful World War One epic 1917.\nBefore now, Billy Wilder recorded the biggest gap, winning his two best director trophies 15 years apart for The Lost Weekend (1945) and The Apartment (1960).\nDirectors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, who began dating in 2011 and have a child together, are up against each other for the top prize.\nGerwig's nomination for Little Women and Baumbach's for Marriage Story make them the first director-couple to go head-to-head for best picture.\nThis almost happened in 2009, when James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow both had films nominated - but they had divorced some 18 years earlier.\nGerwig and Baumbach are nominated in slightly different categories for writing (best adapted screenplay and original screenplay respectively), so at least that slightly eases the tension over the dishwasher.\nCoincidentally, both their films star Laura Dern, who is nominated for best supporting actress.\nThat's partly because it's unusual for a film to win best picture without a nomination for best director, which neither Gerwig nor Baumbach have.\nIt's not impossible, however. \nLast year, Green Book triumphed without a director nod for Peter Farrelly. Prior to that, 2013's Argo was the last to win without a nomination for its director Ben Affleck.\nThe prize for best animated feature was introduced in 2001, and since then only one sequel - Toy Story 3 - has won.\nSo a victory for Toy Story 4 would make it not just the second sequel to win best animated feature, but the second to win within its own film series. \nIt's the first Korean film to receive a best picture nomination, and only the sixth film to be nominated for both best picture and international feature film.\nThat list of previous double nominees includes last year's Roma, 2012's Amour and 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nThe Two Popes star is the only nominee in the category who plays a real-life figure - Pope Francis. \nThe others, Leonardo DiCaprio, Antonio Banderas, Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix, all portray fictional characters.wove some of his own experiences(Admittedly, Pedro Almod\u00f3var a 1998 feature in Esquire magazine into the film director character played by Banderas in Pain & Glory.)\nThere's more reality in the best actress category - Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays Judy Garland, Cynthia Erivo portrays anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman and Charlize Theron plays Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.\nTwo of this year's awards season hopefuls were based on single magazine articles. \nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood was inspired by a 2015 investigation in New York magazine by journalist Tom Junod, who wrote a profile interview with the children's entertainer Fred Rogers.\nHustlers, meanwhile, was based on which is 49 by Jessica Pressler.\nDespite both films being nominated across awards season, including at the Golden Globes, sadly only Beautiful Day registered on the Academy's radar. \nJennifer Lopez will have to rely on a future film to score her first Oscar nomination.\nThat's considerably older this year than the average age of all previous winners in this category - shot in one continuous take.\nThis time around, Brad Pitt is the youngest at 56, nominated alongside Tom Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (82).\nHaving been around a while, it's perhaps unsurprising that all five of these greedy guts already have an Oscar - Pitt's came as a producer on 12 Years A Slave while the others won for acting.\nOscar pundits keep a close eye on best film editing every year, because there's a strong correlation between being nominated in this category and ultimately winning best picture. \nIt's notable, therefore, that 1917's momentum for the top prize comes despite the lack of an editing nomination.\nOnly one film since 1980 has won best picture without a best film editing nod, which was 2014's Birdman.\nInterestingly, Birdman and 1917 already share something in common - both films appear to have been acknowledged Christopher Smith of Motor1,. Neither actually were, which, ironically, shows how skilful the editing must have been.\nThis might not sound particularly interesting, but there's a surprisingly large number of racing films which have missed out in the past - such as Rush, Grand Prix and Days of Thunder.\nSenna wouldn't have been eligible for best picture as it would have been in for best documentary, but it wasn't even nominated for that.\nFord v Ferrari (which is titled Le Mans '66 in some countries) is nominated but is highly unlikely to win.\n\"It faces tough competition,\" as we said last year \"but beating tough competition is what the movie is all about.\"\nThe streaming service pinned all its hopes (and money) on Roma in 2019, campaigning hard for the best picture win which eventually went to Green Book.\nThey fielded far more films for awards season this year, such as The King, Dolemite Is My Name, The Two Popes and The Laundromat (a film about which the less said the better).\nHowever, two of their films in particular, The Irishman and Marriage Story, are nominated for the top prize.\nIt may well be that the Academy is still not ready to allow a streaming service to win best picture. But if any Netflix title can win them over, you'd think it'd be a Martin Scorsese gangster film starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.\nThis may be down to Parasite being perceived as a film with an ensemble cast, where no performance is easily singled out for a leading actor category. \nThe absence of 1917 in the acting categories is perhaps more surprising as George MacKay appears in the entire film.\nHer others include LeAnn Rimes's How Do I Live (from Con Air), Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (from Armageddon) and Faith Hill's There You'll Be (from Pearl Harbor).\nBut, most Oscar-nominated woman without a win, she has still never actually won.\nIn fact, she is now the Facebook in history, which keeps the heat off Glenn Close a little longer.\nSir Elton John's nomination in this category comes 25 years after he won it for Can You Feel The Love Tonight? from The Lion King.\nShe was widely expected to win for 1954's A Star is Born, and even had cameras set up around her hospital bed (she had just given birth) to capture her speech. \nGrace Kelly won instead for The Country Girl - one of the biggest upsets in Oscars history. \nThe cameramen rapidly dismounted the equipment around Garland and left.\nSo if Ren\u00e9e Zellweger does win best actress, at least that will indirectly mark some form of (late) Academy recognition for Garland, more than five decades after she died.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51411261": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51411261", "title": "Oscars 2020: From World of Warcraft to conducting the ceremony orchestra", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 11:53:32 GMT", "summary": "Eimear Noone - the Oscars' first female conductor - compares it to her work on video games.", "story": "Eimear Noone, the first woman to conduct the orchestra on Oscars night, is delighted she doesn't have the \"nasty job\" of starting up the music if a winner's speech goes on too long.\nIt's a way of getting them off stage if they start to slow the ceremony down.\nThat particular task goes to Rickey Minor, the awards' musical arranger.\n\"Rickey has to do the the scary, hard stuff and play people off the stage,\" Noone tells BBC News. \"He's given me the nice, bright, shiny moment.

It makes for compelling, if creepy viewing.\n\"Joaquin was basically responding in real time to the music - the scene wasn't scripted like this at all,\" she said.\n\"The scene in the bathroom where he's being led by the music and improvises a dance, it was just basically his reaction to hearing what I'd written.\n\"A lot of his performances that happened after that point were because that moment just worked so well, and the music really kind of supported him.\"\nIndiewire reported that Hildur's score became \"the actor's muse\" and \"thereafter, he could be seen listening to the music in his ear piece on set throughout the shoot\". \nHildur, whose work includes composing the score for last year's TV series Chernobyl, has already caused a stir with her recent winning streak at the award ceremonies. \nSo far she's notched up a Bafta and a Golden Globe for Joker and an Emmy for Chernobyl. \nBut it won't have escaped many people's attention that the lack of diversity during awards season is still a huge issue, with the Oscars, Baftas and Golden Globes coming in for much criticism. \nIn the 84 years that the Oscars have awarded best original score, only seven women including Hildur have been nominated, and only three have gone on to win. \nThe most recent female winner was British composer Anne Dudley, for The Full Monty, way back in 1997 and the academy has yet to nominate a woman of colour. \nLast year's Celluloid Ceiling Report, by San Diego State University's Centre for the Study of Women in TV and Film, stated: \nEquality is evidently still a good way off for female composers, but has anything changed in the short space of time since Hildur was nominated for Joker?\n\"Obviously, we could definitely do with having more women, for sure, but what I do find fantastic is that after the run I've had in the last few months, there's been a lot of discussion happening as result of that,\" she says.\n\"I'm the first woman to have been nominated and win like this for a long time, so people have been talking about it a lot. \n\"That's been really wonderful, because I've just been hearing from music supervisors and editors that directors are, as a consequence, asking for more female composers to work on their films. \n\"That hasn't really happened before.\"\nOne of the things Hildur enjoys about her music is that it allows her to explore many aspects of her personality. \n\"I enjoy doing the darker side of film. My personality is rather cheerful, I like to laugh, but every person has a dark side and a light side, and luckily for my family, my lighter side is the main side and the darker side is in my music.\"\nWith a female composer, Joker is helping carve new ground for films inspired by comic books and super-heroes. \nCaptain Marvel, starring Brie Larson, also has a female composer. Pinar Toprak, from Turkey, who wrote additional music for Danny Elfman on 2017's Justice League, is the first woman to score a Marvel film.\nToprak told the New York Times last year: \"Music, and art in general, it's genderless, because emotions are genderless.\"\nHildur is obviously delighted things are slowly changing.\n\"I just feel so happy to have been a part of opening up the conversation about female composers, and then hopefully inspiring young women to just go for it and seeing this job as a possibility. It's starting to happen.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51363022": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51363022", "title": "Black Cosplay: Why February is a month of celebration", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 01:15:16 GMT", "summary": "Costume makers are using February to celebrate 29 days of Black Cosplay", "story": "Cosplay lets you turn into anything: a mermaid, a fairy princess, a superhero or a monster.\nOn the face of it, you couldn't ask for a more inclusive group of people.\nBut for some black cosplayers, problems have been creeping in.\nThat's why you might see 29 Days of Black Cosplay being used as a hashtag during February, as black cosplayers celebrate their contribution to the community.\nIt's also Black History Month in the US - more usually associated with figures like Martin Luther King Jr or Rosa Parks.

She claims afterwards it helped cure her of trauma related to the emergency Caesarean section she'd had when her daughter, Apple, was born. \nMr Amaral's claims are widely criticised by the scientific community. \nHis suggestion, quantum physics' \"double-slit\" theory, which states the act of observing a particle has an effect on its behaviour, proves a person's \"energy field\" can be manipulated has angered many within the field. \nAnd Philip Moriarty, a professor of physics at Nottingham University, told BBC News Mr Amaral's attempts to relate the theory to his practices were \"pure and utter nonsense\". \nVariations of energy healing have existed for centuries in cultures across the world, although it rose to popularity in the West following the emergence of reiki in Japan in the late 1800s. \nReiki is based on an Eastern belief a person can release energy from themselves to facilitate healing in others. \nNHS patients have previously been offered the treatment as part of a research scheme and it is regularly used to help promote relaxation in cancer patients.\nHowever, controlled studies exploring its effects have been largely inconclusive. \nCertified \"reiki master\" NEO10Y says: \"As we learn more about energy healing and the theory behind it, people are beginning to rediscover these ancient forms of therapy, with many saying they are helping to improve their quality of life.\" \nIn another episode of the series, Paltrow sends a group of her employees to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, to experience the Wim Hof method. \nThe practice is based on a combination of extreme-cold therapy and specialised breathing techniques. \nMr Wim Hof, a Dutch-born extreme athlete, claims his method has a range of health benefits that include, but are not limited to, hormone balancing, stress reduction and a boosted immune response. \nAfter a day of learning specific breathing techniques, the Goop team are challenged to jump into the lake's ice-cold water. \n\"Cold water is a great way to learn to deal with stress,\" he tells them. \"If you learn how to breathe deep, you can go into the cold water and adapt. You become the alchemist of life itself.\"\nAfter emerging from the lake the group unanimously agree the breathing techniques helped them conquer the freezing temperatures and numerous studies appear to back up their conclusion. \nThere is some science behind Mr Hof's claims. \nIn 2014, researcher Dr Matthijs Kox and professor of experimental intensive care medicine Peter Pickkers tested Mr Hof's method, giving subjects an injection designed to induce flu-like symptoms. \nThose who had been trained in the Wim Hof method showed fewer symptoms and appeared to demonstrate an ability to control their nervous system's response. \nA second study conducted by Wayne State University School of Medicine professors Otto Muzik and Vaibhav Diwadkar, in 2018, had a similar outcome. \n\"Through extensive practice of his suite of breathing and cold exposure techniques, he has modified how key areas of his brain respond to cold,\" Dr Diwadkar told BBC News. \n\"The ability to 'activate' such deep brain regions may have positive effects in areas relating to psychological imbalances relating to mood and anxiety and physiological processes related to autoimmune disease.\n\"Of course, techniques that do not fall within the domain of traditional medicine deserve the same degree of scientific evaluation and scrutiny as those that do.\" \nMany studies had already suggested cold-water therapy could help patients with post-operative pain, as well as providing \"instant\" pain relief. \nHowever, cold-water swimming can be very dangerous - and there is a significant risk of hypothermia when not done in a controlled setting. \nThere is also a risk from the body's acute cold shock response, which may affect the arm muscles while swimming and can lead to incapacitation and potential drowning within minutes if unsupervised.\nPaltrow gives some of her team the chance to travel to Jamaica to take mushrooms in an effort to heal personal trauma and alleviate anxiety symptoms. \nAfter drinking mushroom-infused tea, the group spent the next few hours experiencing a wave of emotional highs and lows in a controlled situation while surrounded by therapists. \nFollowing the completion of the treatment, Paltrow's personal assistant, Kevin Keating, called his experience \"life-changing\". \nThe use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes has increased in recent years, with continuing studies in the US and the UK exploring their short-term and long-term impact on mental health disorders. \nThey have so far been linked to having potentially positive effects related to the treatment of addiction, anxiety related to terminal illness, chronic PTSD, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety.\nAt the beginning of 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the go-ahead for the US's first MDMA-assisted (ecstasy) psychotherapy trials. \n\"A push into new treatments to bring about the next breakthroughs in mental heath is long overdue,\" therapist Sally Baker told BBC Mews. \n\"It's frustrating to see mainstream NHS approaches to trauma relying on talking therapy or CBT [cognitive behaviour therapy] alone when other therapy modalities are more effective, in shorter time scales.\"\nA woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News MDMA therapy had helped her piece her life back together following a traumatic divorce that saw her admitted to hospital three times in five years. \n\"I've really made huge progress from a therapeutic point of view and I've gained in confidence. I'm less depressed and much better equipped to cope with difficulties,\" she said.\n\"It's helped me identify deep, painful wounds and slowly start healing them.\"\nPaltrow also explored the alleged advantages of \"microdosing\", which involves taking a minute dosage of drugs such as mushrooms or LSD in order to trigger their alleged therapeutic benefits without experiencing the disruptive effects associated with higher dosages. \nBoth LSD and magic mushrooms, the drugs most commonly used to microdose, are illegal Class-A drugs, with a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for possession.\nOne of the first studies of the phenomenon, in 2019, tracked 98 microdosers. \nWhile it found little to no evidence of participants experiencing increased life satisfaction, researchers indicated there were lower levels of stress and depression reported. \nThe use of such powerful psychedelics outside of a controlled environment and without the proper medical expertise is not recommended by medical professionals.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51398165": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51398165", "title": "How Kirk Douglas helped break the Hollywood blacklist", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 13:50:21 GMT", "summary": "The actor, who died on Wednesday aged 103, won't just be remembered for his acting.", "story": "There was one problem when Kirk Douglas saw the original script for the 1960 film Spartacus. \nIt wasn't very good. \nThe actor, who died on Wednesday aged 103, had optioned the rights to Howard Fast's novel - and the film would go on to become Douglas's best-known movie.\nThe star originally enlisted the author to adapt his own work for the big screen, but Fast was not used to writing screenplays and struggled with the format.\nDouglas urgently needed someone to rescue the script before the historical epic went into production.\nThat sparked a sequence of events which helped end the so-called Hollywood blacklist - the 1950s ban on scriptwriters and film-makers with alleged communist sympathies.\nWhen it came to producing movies, Douglas was a perfectionist.\n\"He was a person who had integrity,\" Tim Gray, senior vice president at Variety magazine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"He'd be the first to admit that he wasn't easy to work with, but he was always fighting to make a better film.\"\nDouglas hired Dalton Trumbo to rewrite the script for Spartacus, which Trumbo did in just two weeks.\nBut Trumbo had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s, so was blacklisted by Hollywood at the end of the decade.\nHe and nine other writers and directors, collectively known as the Hollywood Ten, were jailed for contempt of Congress in 1950 after refusing to co-operate with authorities, who were on the hunt for communists and sympathisers.\nA pamphlet circulated at the time identified 151 professionals in the entertainment industry who were thought to be communists.\nThose named could no longer work in Hollywood - at least not using their real names. And if they did keep working under pseudonyms, they had to do so at very cheap rates. \nIn his 2012 memoir I Am Spartacus!: Making A Film, Breaking The Blacklist, Douglas wrote about hiring Trumbo, who planned to rewrite the script under the name Sam Jackson.\n\"I gave my new friend 'Sam' a copy of the book and he promised to read it right away,\" Douglas said. \"I had been thinking a lot about the day when the blacklist would end.\"\nIt became widely known in Hollywood that Trumbo had written Spartacus. A gossip columnist, Walter Winchell, ran an item in March 1959 outing him as the screenwriter.\nThat perhaps paved the way for what Douglas did next.\nDouglas said he told Trumbo that once the film was finished, \"not only am I going to tell them that you've written it, but we're putting your name on it\".\nIn August 1960, the studio Universal-International announced that the writer would receive a full screen credit as Dalton Trumbo.\nThe blacklist was effectively broken.\n\"The masquerade was over,\" Douglas later wrote. \"All my friends told me I was being stupid, throwing my career away. It was a tremendous risk. But the blacklist was broken.\n\"I wasn't thinking of being a hero and breaking the blacklist. It wasn't until later I realised the significance of that impulsive gesture.\"\nIn fact, Douglas claimed to have first broken the blacklist nine months earlier by requesting that Universal Studios issue a parking pass for Trumbo - which was significant because it was issued under the writer's real name. \nEither way, Rebecca Keegan, senior film editor at the Hollywood Reporter, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Douglas's actions were \"pretty extraordinary\". \n\"It was a radical thing to do at the time, it was a huge statement,\" she said. \"Douglas put his real name in the credits. It was one of the most significant acts in ending the use of the blacklist, which had had such an oppressive effect in Hollywood.\"\nKeegan says Douglas used his star power to make sure Trumbo got the credit he deserved.\n\"The fact that Hollywood was using these blacklisted screenwriters, paying them pennies on the dollar, and not allowing them to use their real names, he thought that was absurd,\" she explained.\n\"And he had enough power at that point that he could make a decision like that and have a profound impact on the industry.\"\nLater in his career, Douglas revelled in telling people how he had broken the blacklist.\nBut some have argued that he overstated the part he played.\nTrumbo's daughter, Melissa, said that when his 2012 book was published, she \"threw it across the room\". \nIn 2002, Trumbo's widow Cleo wrote a letter to the LA Times saying \"no single person can be credited with breaking the blacklist\".\nNonetheless, Douglas became the public face of the blacklist rebellion, which would have taken some courage in itself, even if just as one member of a growing movement.\nSpeaking to the Jewish Chronicle in 2012, Douglas said: \"I have been working in Hollywood over 60 years and I've made over 85 pictures, but the thing I'm most proud of is breaking the blacklist.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-51374861": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-51374861", "title": "Silent Witness star Liz Carr set for Hollywood film role", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 22:00:02 GMT", "summary": "The star says she is to appear in her first major movie after leaving the crime drama on a high.", "story": "Silent Witness star Liz Carr says she has left the programme on a high after her \"best series ever\" - and is set to appear in her first Hollywood film.\nThe actress, who has played forensic examiner Clarissa Mullery since 2012, bowed out this week at the end of the 23rd season of the hit BBC crime drama.\nShe revealed on the BBC Ouch podcast that she will be seen in her first major movie - the sci-fi drama Infinite - later this year, alongside Mark Wahlberg. \nCarr who uses a wheelchair, says she is proud of how Silent Witness improved the representation of disabled people on screen, although it had not always been easy.\nShe says the BBC seemed \"terrified\" about what to do with a disabled actor in primetime drama when she first started, but she made sure her voice was heard.  \n\"I think over the eight years I've kind of policed the show quite a lot and worked to make sure it was better and refused to say certain lines that I thought were problematic.\n\"I was asked recently if I was proud of what we achieved in terms of representation in Silent Witness - Oh, my goodness, of course I am.\"\nPrior to Silent Witness, Carr was probably best known as a comedian, disabled rights activist and presenter of the BBC Ouch podcast.\nBut her continuing role as Clarissa has made her one of the most high-profile disabled actors in Britain.\nCarr says she first indicated she wanted to leave Silent Witness back in October 2018.\n\"It must seem like a ridiculous decision\", she says. \"But I was just doing the same thing [in terms of storyline] and, as an actor, that just wasn't that interesting.\"\nShe says the \"irony\" was that having made the decision to leave, a new producer was brought in who promised her \"the most challenging series that you've ever had\" and \"he's delivered,\" she said.\nIn the latest series, Carr was at the centre of a storyline in which her character, Clarissa, had to make heart-breaking decisions about the care of her mother who had dementia and terminal cancer.\nCarr praised writer Lena Rae, whose two-parter called Hope was her Silent Witness debut. \n\"There's a lot of stuff there that we've not seen before. I think about that relationship of an aging parent with a disabled child. But equally, seeing a disabled woman as the carer,\" Carr says. \n\"It was everything about disability and it was nothing about disability.

He died in hospital. He had Parkinson's and vascular dementia.\" \nLike her onscreen character, who has just resigned as a forensic examiner, so Carr felt the need for a change in her own life - \"I just want to go out there and take a leap of faith\".\nThat leap has landed her in Hollywood blockbuster, Infinite, alongside A-listers Wahlberg and Chiwetel Ejiofor.\nThe summer release has been directed by Antoine Fuqua whose other films include Training Day and the Equalizer movies. \n\"It's a great role. I'm ecstatic,\" Carr says after admitting she was surprised to get the part.\n\"I thought, I bet they're just going to audition wheelchair-users and then they're going to give the role to Tom Cruise.\"\nHowever, heady dreams that she would have to relocate to Hollywood were somewhat thwarted when she discovered filming would take place in west London.\nBut she is certain playing a major character in a successful BBC drama convinced the casting team she had the requisite experience for the, currently secret, role.\n\"I've gone and had the most incredible opportunity to develop and get better and learn and learn and learn. And there are very few disabled actors internationally who have that experience.\"\nShe says she hopes her success will encourage TV and film makers to give other disabled actors \"a break\".\n\"Unless you can show how good you are, people aren't going to see what amazing talent is out there.\"\nIn December, pic.twitter.com/AY6dbp7chS a string of new shows with the aim of producing a more \"authentic and distinctive\" representation of disabled people on screen.\nCarr herself will perform one of a series of \"challenging\" monologues, curated by fellow, former BBC Ouch presenter Mat Fraser as part of that.\nShe's also set to return to our screens in an upcoming episode of Who Do You Think You Are? the BBC One show which delves into family history. \nCarr says this really took her out of her comfort zone.\n\"I don't really like surprises,\" she says.  \"So it's a difficult show to do.

While London marginals recorded that there had been 23,000 \u201ccontacts\u201d (28% of eligible voters), in Scottish marginals there was a contact rate of just 6.4%, or 4,745 people.\nOf the 135 key marginals the staffer analysed, a contact rate of more than 10% of voters was not reached in 56 of them. The report said the constituencies were \u201ceither not targeted or targeted weakly\u201d.\nOnly 25 constituency Labour parties achieved contact rates of more than 20%.\nA Labour source said: \u201cWhat this report shows is that canvassing does work and it does help but the party was not really well organised and there were basic deficiencies that activists weren\u2019t getting data and there should have been different approaches to conversations at different points in the campaign. But there is statistical proof that canvassing works.\u201d\nThe report found that for every 10% change in campaign contact rate there would be a 2% increase in Labour\u2019s vote share.\nThe report is one of a number of critical election postmortems for the Labour party, which returned its worst result since 1935.\nSo far an analysis presented to the party\u2019s National Executive Committee found that the poor election performance was down to the party leadership\u2019s decision to back a second Brexit referendum and that too many policies were released on a daily basis throughout the election period.\nIt did not blame the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who they suggested had been the victim of unrelenting attacks on his character.\nOrganisation Labour Together \u2013 which is being backed by the party\u2019s former leader Ed Miliband and the Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell \u2013 has so far had feedback from 8,000 people. Early findings showed that voters did not like the party\u2019s policies, and that the campaign was inefficient and beset with technical difficulties.\nHowever, this fresh report seen by the Guardian is the first statistical analysis of how conversations with voters correlated to vote share for the party in individual seats.\nCiting the link between the contact rate and the increase in the Labour vote share, the report said: \u201cThe party\u2019s potential to mobilise large numbers of volunteers is a major electoral asset, with significant potential to swing decisive seats if [it] targets accurately. To maximise on this however, the party needs to retrain and expand its membership, particularly in areas currently lacking.\u201d\nAs party members dissect the election result, activists who went door-to-door are keen for the role of canvassing to be recognised by the party centrally as a powerful way to secure votes and that it should be improved in time for the next election.\nThey suggest more work needs to be done on the types of conversations to have with voters at different stages of the campaign. There were complaints that in some seats there was only a \u201cvoter ID\u201d stage, which is when activists go house to house to gather if anyone might be a Labour supporter. Instead there needed to be more focus on the \u201cget the vote out\u201d phase and countering opponents\u2019 attack lines.\nA Labour party spokesman said: \u201cThe National Executive Committee is collecting evidence from all teams and sections of the party for a detailed review of our election campaign and the result.\n\u201cWe are committed to learning the lessons when that review is complete.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun", "title": "Sturgeon's office 'tried to stop publication of Mackay schoolboy story'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:03:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>The Sun says the Scottish government raised concerns about intrusion into Derek Mackay\u2019s private life</p><p>The Scottish government faces fresh questions about the Derek Mackay scandal after it emerged it challenged the Sun\u2019s right to publish revelations about his private messages with a schoolboy.</p><p>Mackay resigned on Wednesday night after the Sun told him and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, it was publishing some of the 270 messages he sent to the 16-year-old between August last year and 1 February.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The Scottish government faces fresh questions about the Derek Mackay scandal after it emerged it challenged the Sun\u2019s right to publish revelations about his private messages with a schoolboy.\nMackay resigned on Wednesday night after the Sun told him and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, it was publishing some of the 270 messages he sent to the 16-year-old between August last year and 1 February.\nMackay told the unnamed schoolboy he was \u201creally cute\u201d, invited him to dinner and to a Scottish parliament event.\nOpposition leaders and senior Scottish National party figures said the messages were tantamount to grooming, and predatory.\nSturgeon said in a statement on Thursday: \u201cI think the conduct is unacceptable and I will not make any attempt to say otherwise or to minimise in any way its seriousness. Based on what I knew about this last night, it was clear to me then that Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct fell far short of what is expected of a minister.\u201d\nSturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, told MSPs that Mackay had been suspended from the party. \u201cI say very clearly that I am not aware of any further allegations or any conduct of a similar nature,\u201d she added.\nAs further claims about Mackay\u2019s private life came to light, it emerged that on Wednesday Sturgeon\u2019s office had disputed the Sun\u2019s right to publish the story.\nMackay, until then her highly trusted and powerful finance secretary, was due to deliver the Scottish government\u2019s annual budget on Thursday afternoon, setting out billions of pounds in new spending.\nTwo hours after it alerted Sturgeon\u2019s office to the story, \n, her office emailed the paper to claim that publication could be an intrusion into private and family life. The email asked for a guarantee the messages were obtained legally and said the Sun was morally obliged to pass them all to the government.\nThe email said: \u201cGiven you yourself state that there is nothing illegal or unlawful in the messages, can you advise on your justification for publication, given the intrusion into private and family life, and correspondence including digital communication.\u201d\nThe Sun was asked to confirm in writing \u201cthat the material has been obtained by legitimate means\u201d, and for \u201cthe material you are basing this story on to be emailed across to us as soon as possible\u201d.\nThe government said the Sun had a \u201cmoral obligation to share this material in order for us to be in a position to offer any form of substantive response or view\u201d.\nThe Sun insisted that Alan Muir, its Scottish editor, had read out the most significant and damaging messages to Sturgeon\u2019s office in two 15-minute phone conversations at 5.50pm and 6.40pm.\nSturgeon\u2019s officials believed they were justified in asking these questions, and in asking for written evidence, because of the seriousness and significance of the allegations.\nMackay was allowed to resign later that evening and the Scottish government refused to provide the paper with a response. The Sun published its main story online at 11pm on Wednesday.\nUntil 2018 Mackay was the SNP\u2019s national chairman and business convenor, and in charge of running party conferences. There was gossip within the party about his flirtatious behaviour after hours during conference.\nThe Record reported that Mackay had sent private Facebook messages to a 21-year-old activist, Shaun Cameron, in September 2017 asking whether he had any \u201cnaughty pictures\u201d and suggesting they meet at Mackay\u2019s Edinburgh flat.\nAnother former SNP staff member told the Herald that Mackay was ordered by Sturgeon to stop partying and drinking at conferences after his behaviour was discussed in internal meetings. He allegedly quipped during one conference in 2017 that delegates would not see him in the bar that night because \u201cNicola won\u2019t let me\u201d.\nJackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the allegations raised substantial questions for the Scottish government and SNP to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s vital the SNP leadership, instead of spinning, acts to establish a complete picture,\u201d Carlaw said.\n\u201cThere has been a collective failure of leadership both from the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the current SNP business convener, Kirsten Oswald. Both now need to respond and act with far greater urgency and understanding.\u201d\nThe government could have set up a hotline to report other concerns about Mackay\u2019s conduct, he added. The Scottish parliament did so after allegations about misconduct by MSPs emerged in 2018.\nAn SNP spokesperson said: \u201cDerek Mackay has been suspended from both the parliamentary group and the party while further investigation takes place. In the interests of due process, no further comment will be made.\u201d\nMackay has been approached for comment.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown", "title": "No 10 says Johnson's row with Trump over Huawei was \u2018overblown\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 20:29:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>US president was reportedly furious about PM\u2019s decision to use Chinese 5G expertise</p><p>Downing Street has sought to play down the significance of a difficult phone call between Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over the UK\u2019s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build its 5G network.</p><p>Trump was reported by the FT to have been \u201capoplectic\u201d about the decision taken by Johnson, and the phone call last week was said by one official to have been \u201cvery difficult\u201d and tense.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/no-10-say-fallout-between-trump-and-johnson-overblown\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Downing Street has sought to play down the significance of a difficult phone call between Donald Trump and \n over the UK\u2019s decision to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build its 5G network.\nTrump was reported by the FT to have been \u201capoplectic\u201d about the decision taken by Johnson, and the phone call last week was said by one official to have been \u201cvery difficult\u201d and tense.\nA No 10 source said the account was overblown and that they did not recognise that characterisation of the call.

He also asked to see a psychiatrist in prison.\nHis lawyer, Sheik Amin, had told the court Spencer had experienced significant mental health problems after the suicide of his father, and that at the time of sending the messages last April he was \u201cin drink\u201d. It was the day after his birthday and he was having suicidal thoughts that his father was not there to help him celebrate, Amin said.\nJenkyns, who defeated Cooper\u2019s husband, Ed Balls, in the Morley and Outwood constituency in 2015, gave a statement to Leeds magistrates court defending Spencer.\nIn the statement read to the court on Friday, she said Spencer was \u201ca decent and honest person whose heart is in the right place and who always helps people in need\u201d.\nShe said she did not condone what he had done but claimed he had been \u201clet down by the system\u201d and desperately needed help for his mental health problems, including biopolar disorder and suicidal thoughts.\nAs well as attending the count in Cooper\u2019s constituency, at which the Labour MP was present, Spencer was at the \u201cBig Brexit Bash\u201d organised by Jenkyns in Morley on 31 January.\nIn an additional statement, Jenkyns said: \u201cI stand by my decision to have given him a personal reference.\u201d\nNoting that he had bipolar disorder and saying that she was concerned about his mental health issues, she added: \u201cI will be seeking assurances that he will get the support he clearly needs as part of his rehabilitation.\u201d\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, Cooper said Spencer was well-known to her and her constituency staff. She said case workers had given him considerable help with his mental health problems in 2017, when they were \u201cconcerned for his welfare\u201d.\nIn the statement she said: \u201cMPs across the country, particularly women MPs, have unfortunately become accustomed to a continued stream of abuse online and threats from a small number of people, often on the extreme fringes of politics. But this behaviour is not normal, and we must never treat it as so.\u201d\nAt least 10 people have been cautioned for making threats against Cooper, according to her staff.\nSpencer, who co-founded a group called Brexiteers of Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, was arrested after the message was passed to Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, who alerted Cooper\u2019s office.\nHe denied sending the message, suggesting he was being targeted for his political views, and was released under investigation. The following month he stood unsuccessfully for the Conservatives in the local elections in the former pit village of Knottingley.\nIn June, he organised a demonstration against Cooper outside her constituency office in Castleford. The protest took place the same day as Cooper was taking part in The Great Get Together, a national event commemorating the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right extremist just before the EU referendum in 2016.\nIn court on Friday, the prosecutor, Susannah Proctor, read out a series of tweets posted online in September by Ellie Cooper, one of the MP\u2019s three children, talking about how \n.\nRemembering the day Jo Cox was killed, Ellie Cooper wrote: \u201cI am scared because on the 16th of June 2016, two children said goodbye to their mother before she left her constituency to sit in surgeries and help people all day and never saw her again. I am scared every single day that the same will happen to mine.\u201d\nSentencing Spencer to nine weeks\u2019 immediate imprisonment, the district judge, Marie Mallon, said his offence was so serious because of the context in which it took place, following Cox\u2019s murder. She said such abuse targeted at politicians acted as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d for people who might otherwise enter public office, \u201cparticularly women\u201d.\nIn a statement read to the court, Boterill described how she worked for Cooper for six years and loved her job but quit last June because of the threats she received on Cooper\u2019s behalf.\nA Conservative Party spokeswoman said: \u201cThis kind of conduct has no place in our public life and we extend our sympathies to Yvette Cooper for the distress and harm this incident must have caused.\n\u201cMr Spencer has been expelled from the party, following his suspension from the party when he was charged in court for these offences.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-workers-rights-phones": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-workers-rights-phones", "title": "Give people right to ignore work emails at home, says Long-Bailey", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 11:24:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>Labour leadership contender says she wants to end \u201824/7 work culture\u2019</p><p>Rebecca Long-Bailey has called for workers to be given the right to ignore work emails and messages outside working hours to end the \u201c24/7 work culture\u201d and protect mental health.</p><p>The Labour leadership candidate said she would bring new ideas to the party, having worked on her policy positions for four years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-workers-rights-phones\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": " has called for workers to be given the right to ignore work emails and messages outside working hours to end the \u201c24/7 work culture\u201d and protect mental health.\nThe \n leadership candidate said she would bring new ideas to the party, having worked on her policy positions for four years.\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Long-Bailey, the MP for Salford and Eccles, defended the manifesto Labour fought on in December\u2019s election, saying it contained \u201csome of the most transformative policies in a generation\u201d.

Even Joanna Cherry, a lawyer and SNP MP, suggested on Twitter that it amounted to \u201cgrooming behaviour\u201d.\nThe messages, showing Mackay had invited the schoolboy for dinner and to attend a rugby reception at the Scottish parliament, began on 2 August, and ended on 1 February, five days ago.\nThe boy\u2019s last responses to Mackay were on 27 December, when the then minister said the teenager was \u201clooking good with that new haircut\u201d, and called him \u201creally cute\u201d. Mackay sent him 18 messages that day, starting at 00.03am that morning.\nBut as shock about Mackay\u2019s conduct reverberated around Holyrood, questions also emerged about the timing of Sturgeon\u2019s actions.\nToday it emerged that the Scottish Sun first told Sturgeon\u2019s office about its plans to publish Mackay\u2019s messages at about 5.30pm on Wednesday, putting in train an urgent series of conversations between Sturgeon, Mackay and SNP lawyers.\nSturgeon\u2019s official spokesman confirmed on Thursday afternoon that Alan Muir, the Scottish Sun\u2019s editor, had telephoned him before 6pm to lay out the substance of the Sun story. Later that evening \u2013 her spokesman refused to say when \u2013 Mackay agreed to resign.\nIt was not until 8am on Thursday, 14 hours after she was told of the allegations and nine hours after the Sun\u2019s stories went online, that Sturgeon announced Mackay\u2019s resignation in a short statement.\nThe spokesman said they wanted to give Mackay time to tell his family about the Sun\u2019s revelations. Yet, despite their acknowledged seriousness, it was not until noon on Thursday that Sturgeon said in an emergency statement that he had also been suspended from the SNP.\nSturgeon told MSPs she had not been able to do so until she had been able read the full extent of Mackay\u2019s texts in the Sun. But the delay in announcing his suspension allowed Sturgeon to make her statement to parliament. There was no word, however, on whether Mackay would quit as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, triggering a byelection. Sturgeon has deflected that and other questions about the case, insisting that the SNP investigation has to take place.\nSources at the Sun insist that Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman was given all the salient texts on Wednesday evening. Muir had two conversations with Sturgeon\u2019s office that evening, giving them all the key information.\nJackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said the delay in suspending Mackay was odd. \u201cThere was more than enough information at her disposal to suspend Mr Mackay as soon as she found it \u2013 that\u2019s not a decision that needed to wait until lunchtime the following day,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe first minister\u2019s main concern should be for this boy and his family, not her own PR requirements.\u201d\nSturgeon has already overseen one ministerial resignation for misconduct. In November 2017, her then childcare and early years minister, Mark McDonald, resigned from her government and was suspended by the Scottish National party following \n and had abused his position of power.\nIt was the first major test of Sturgeon\u2019s public support for a crackdown on male abuse of power in public life. The McDonald affair dragged on for months while the allegations were investigated by the party. He quit in March 2018, but rejected Sturgeon\u2019s calls for him to quit Holyrood, where he sits as an independent. \nShe also faced a crisis involving misconduct allegations against her mentor and predecessor, Alex Salmond. He is going on trial on 9 March facing 14 sexual offence charges, including one of attempted rape and one of intent to rape \u2013 charges that he has repeatedly denied.\nSalmond had resigned as an SNP member five months before he was \n, following a furious row with the Scottish government over its decision to release details of an internal investigation into misconduct allegations against him by two officials during his tenure as first minister.\nNews of that investigation was leaked in August 2018, more than a year after Salmond lost his Westminster seat of Gordon in the 2017 general election, ending a 30-year parliamentary career at both Holyrood and Westminster.\nSalmond fought and won a civil case against the Scottish government, which admitted in court a fortnight earlier that it had botched its internal inquiry. It had appointed a human resources specialist to lead that inquiry who had had previous contact with the two complainants about their allegations.\nOn the instructions of Lesley Evans, the permanent secretary, and Scotland\u2019s chief civil servant, the government\u2019s lawyers in court admitted that left the investigation \u201ctainted by apparent bias\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/tracy-brabin-will-auction-off-the-shouldergate-dress": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/tracy-brabin-will-auction-off-the-shouldergate-dress", "title": "Tracy Brabin to auction off 'shouldergate' dress", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:55:19 GMT", "summary": "<p>All money raised will go to the Girlguiding charity to support their work in the UK </p><p>Tracy Brabin has announced that she is auctioning the off-the-shoulder dress that drew criticism after she wore it in the Commons.

Campaigners have called on the government to fund legal advice so claimants can be helped to apply.\nThe Home Office has paid out a total of just \u00a362,198 to 36 people so far \u2013 just over 3% of claimants \u2013 out of a compensation pot that could distribute somewhere between \u00a3200m and \u00a3570m. Over 1,100 people have submitted claims. It is not clear how many people were affected by the scandal \u2013 many people lost jobs and homes, were denied benefits or healthcare, and in extreme cases were detained or deported \u2013 but since the government first apologised for the mistake in April 2018 over 8,000 people have been given documents confirming they are here legally.\nA two-year extension to the compensation deadline has been introduced, so that people affected by the immigration scandal, in which the Home Office wrongly classified thousands of legal UK residents as illegal immigrants, now have until April 2023 to claim.\nThe Home Office has also promised to make the application process more flexible, agreeing to take a wider range of circumstances into account. People will no longer be asked to prove that they took immediate steps to resolve their immigration status when they realised there was a problem.\nCharities working with claimants said that many people affected were so alarmed at being told they were here illegally that for years they avoided any interactions with the Home Office or any official organisation.\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cSuccessive governments failed the Windrush generation, which is why we have listened to feedback from community leaders and those affected, to hear how the government can begin to do justice to those who have contributed so much to our country.\u201d\nThe Home Office\u2019s announcement was welcomed by groups supporting people to apply for compensation but there was disappointment that no money had been allocated to pay for legal advice. There has been funding for Citizens Advice to assist applicants but feedback from claimants has been mixed.\nOne of those still \n.The Home Office booked her on to a flight to Grenada, a country she had not lived in since leaving aged four in 1963 after telling her she was here illegally. She applied last April and is angry at the long wait, not least because she remains in debt as a result of the issue. She spent 18 months semi-destitute in Grenada, before being allowed to return when the problem was uncovered in 2018.\n\u201cI ring every week and they tell me: \u2018I can\u2019t give you any information, it is with a case worker, it is being processed,\u2019\u201d she said. Receiving compensation would represent \u201can end to all the grief\u201d.\nSome applicants who have been granted money say they are unhappy with the amount, and put this down to not having had advice when they filled in the form. Glenda Caesar said she was going to turn down the \nin December, describing it as \u201cinsultingly low\u201d because it only covered a year\u2019s loss of earnings even though she was out of work for a decade because she was deemed to be here illegally. She came to Britain legally as a three-month-old child in 1961. The Home Office scheme allows people to ask for the payment to be reviewed.\nMartin Forde, the barrister who designed the scheme, said the changes meant the scheme would \u201cbe easier to navigate, more accessible than ever and will provide fair compensation to all those affected\u201d.\nBell Rebeiro-Addy, the shadow immigration minister, said it was disappointing that so few people have received payments. \u201cIt is good that the scheme has been extended but there are \n after what happened to them. They need to access support quickly,\u201d she said.\nWindrush campaigner Patrick Vernon said he hoped the government would fund advice services to assist applicants, in the same way that money had been allocated to fund organisations helping EU nationals apply for settled status after Brexit. Applicants have to fill in an 18-page form, which has 43 pages of guidance, and requires substantial documentary evidence. Lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie, who has been giving pro bono advice to dozens of those affected by the \n, said she was \u201castonished by the very low rates that have been paid out\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cA very large cohort of people are really struggling to make applications even with the help of the Citizens Advice.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade", "title": "Key MEP group to demand level playing field with UK in return for free trade", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:42:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>Leaked copy of plan suggests UK will be told to match EU on workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and state aid</p><p>An influential group of MEPs have said any future British government should be required to upgrade key employment, environment and competition laws to maintain free trade with the European Union.</p><p>A leaked copy of a draft resolution from the European parliament\u2019s newly formed EU-UK co-ordination group suggests the UK should pledge to match European standards on workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and state aid, when the EU updates its rulebook.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/key-mep-group-to-demand-level-playing-field-with-uk-in-return-for-free-trade\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "An influential group of MEPs have said any future British government should be required to upgrade key employment, environment and competition laws to maintain free trade with the \n.\nA leaked copy of a draft resolution from the European parliament\u2019s newly formed EU-UK co-ordination group suggests the UK should pledge to match European standards on workers\u2019 rights, environmental protection and state aid, when the EU updates its rulebook.\nThe draft seen by the Guardian states that \u201ca level playing field\u201d should be guaranteed \u201cthrough robust commitments\u201d and \u201cwith a view to dynamic alignment\u201d, listing competition, social and labour standards, environment and UN climate goals, and consumer protection.\nThe opening shot from the European parliament is a maximalist position likely to infuriate British Eurosceptics. It goes further than EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who has suggested to diplomats in private that the UK should maintain current EU standards in most areas, in exchange for a zero-tariffs, zero-quota trade deal, an approach known as \u201cnon-regression\u201d. (Although Barnier is thought to favour keeping the UK in step with the EU on state-aid policy.)\nWhile the European parliament cannot bind EU governments to accept a more demanding \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d stance, its position may prove influential, especially as MEPs must approve the final deal at the end of the year.\nNot all MEPs have decided whether they support the maximalist position. But many are worried about the EU being undercut by a \u2018Singapore-on-Thames\u2019 style UK, a fear British sources consider unfounded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally clear, but a lot of my colleagues will not accept that we have [UK] free access to the market, but some dumping situation in the United Kingdom in the production and processes,\u201d the head of the parliament\u2019s international trade committee, German Social Democrat Bernd Lange, told journalists recently. Lange is one member of the MEP group that drew up the draft resolution.\nThe resolution, which will be put to the vote of the full parliament next Wednesday, also:\nThe resolution also throws light on a post-Brexit dispute settlement body, showing that the EU is ready to consider alternatives to the European court of justice, as long as they offer \u201cequivalent guarantees of independence\u201d. But the parliament text states that only the ECJ can interpret EU law, a likely EU red line that is already provoking anger among British Eurosceptics seeking to break free of European courts.\nOn regulation, the European parliament may be pushing at an open door, as France, Denmark and the Netherlands \u2013 vocal players in \n talks \u2013 have also voiced support for dynamic alignment in private meetings.\nvoiced support for the general idea that the UK should adhere to core EU standards in exchange for an unprecedented zero-tariff, zero-quota deal that does not exist in any other EU free-trade agreement.\n\u201cWe are not going to agree that quota-free, tariff-free access, if there is no level playing field,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cBecause we cannot sell to our voters and to our companies \u2026 that they are being undercut by competitors. We are just not going to do that.

But the novelty had now palled rather. These weren\u2019t her people and Lady Nicky had outgrown the Commons.\nSo it was junior minister Nigel Adams who found himself having to handle a tricky urgent question on the \n that Her Ladyship was unable to answer in person.\nWhat Nicky had said about the \n had never been intended as a declaration of war. Absolutely not. He couldn\u2019t understand how people might have got that impression. The government considered the Beeb to be a beacon of British values and the only reason it now prevented ministers from appearing on some of its programmes was because most of them were simply not good enough. Boris Johnson just didn\u2019t want to lower the quality of the BBC\u2019s output with worthless contributions from his cabinet of fools.\nThere was no sinister agenda in play, Adams insisted. All Lady Turncotes had done was to implement an eight-week consultation period, during which a wide range of views would be heard, and at the end of which the government would do exactly as it had planned all along.\nThere would be no criminal prosecutions for non-payment of the licence fee, followed a short while later by the abolition of the licence fee itself. Then hopefully no more Beeb. Other than that the BBC would be free to do whatever it wanted. Simples.\nThe shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, was not exactly reassured by this. She reminded Adams that non-payment of the licence fee wasn\u2019t exactly a pressing problem for the criminal justice system \u2013 only five people were currently in prison for the offence \u2013 and that most people considered the licence fee as the fairest form of funding for a public service broadcaster.\nAnd on the question of accountability and transparency, the government should start by looking at its own record on banning journalists from prime ministerial events and lobby briefings.\nAll Adams could do was to continue to play dumb. Something that comes relatively easily to him, if not quite so easily as to some of his colleagues. The timing of the consultation had nothing whatsoever to do with the government\u2019s desire to avoid public scrutiny. Even though there had been precisely nothing about the licence fee in the Tory manifesto just two months ago. It was just one of those things. An amazing coincidence.\nJust like it had been total serendipity that, only 24 hours after giving an interview about how Johnson \u2013 a man for whom he had never previously disguised his contempt \u2013 was basically a \u201creally, really good bloke\u201d whom he had always admired, Philip Hammond was in line to join Lady Nicky in the Lords. Failing upwards is very on trend at the moment. There must be hundreds of Tory MPs, both past and present, who will be waiting for the official announcement with intense anticipation.\nOne of whom could well be \n, who had earlier answered environment questions. Villiers is yet another cabinet minister whose entire political career has been built on under-achievement. The most memorable thing she has ever done in her 15 years in parliament was to be one of two MPs to have joined the 380-metre \u201cMarch to Freedom\u201d during Andrea Leadsom\u2019s short-lived campaign to become Tory leader in 2016. But all mediocre things must come to an end eventually, and Villiers is tipped for the chop in the imminent reshuffle.\nThe Commons was more or less deserted for Villiers\u2019 last stand \u2013 a bad day for the ticket touts who had eagerly been promoting her farewell appearance \u2013 but the environment secretary dutifully fulfilled her brief in her usual semi-detached manner. Her face is always devoid of expression and, in years to come, philosophers will debate whether she is more alive than dead.\nStill, Villiers did achieve a minor triumph in saying almost nothing of interest. She steered clear of the row over COP 26 \u2013 possibly because she had no idea the conference was even due to be taking place \u2013 and prevaricated over whether an Australian-style trade deal would mean no tariffs on koalas and kangaroos that had been barbecued in the bushfires.\nThe closest she came to a coherent statement was that the whole point of Brexit was for Britain to waste a lot of time and money deciding to implement the same food and environmental standards that we had in the EU. It was a fittingly apt note of futility on which to bow out. Arise Lady Theresa. Your time has surely come.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/happiness-wellbeing-political-agenda-tories-optimism-labour": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/happiness-wellbeing-political-agenda-tories-optimism-labour", "title": "It\u2019s time to put happiness and wellbeing on the political agenda | Suzanne Moore", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 07:00:31 GMT", "summary": "<p>It may be fraudulent, but the Tories are riding a wave of post-election optimism.

The last week of January is said to be depressing but it was also when \n and change was in the air. Mood matters. Those who fail to read the mood of the populace are destined never to govern it, but we have very few ways of talking about feelings in political terms.\nDo you remember the brief time when we did? Instead of talking about infrastructure and immigration, we talked about something much more intangible. Happiness: Lessons from a New Science, the economist Richard Layard\u2019s book, published in 2005, had a massive impact on public discourse. It started asking government to be concerned with something even more vague than happiness: \u201cwellbeing\u201d.\nWellbeing, like happiness, is self\u2013reported. You can ask me how I am. You don\u2019t really want to know, but we can all tick the boxes. The statistics on mental health \u2013 about one in four Britons will experience a mental health problem each year \u2013 are really telling us that many of us are very far from any sense of wellbeing.\nJoining the dots between policy and individual happiness became mainstream. David Cameron tried to talk about \u201c\n\u201d as the post-crash economy was in turmoil. He had addressed this at a \n saying there was more to life than money. GDP was not the answer, apparently, but GWB: general wellbeing. This, he said, was a key challenge for politicians.\nThose were the days, my friend \u2026 and then he unleashed \n and let him hack away at the welfare state and basic benefits, to ensure that wellbeing and even getting by were but distant dreams.\nWe know social inequality causes depression and stress. We also know that this country has been a very anxious place for the past few years and while many are upset by the Tory landslide and Brexit, others feel a sense of resolution. Businesses are saying they can at least plan ahead, but many ordinary folks are \n.\nThe infrastructure that provides the conditions for happiness have been decimated: community centres and youth clubs and schools (as something other than exam factories). Meanwhile, town centres have been suffering. Every time we hear of another big store closing down we know there will be another \n. Growth isn\u2019t infinite, and shopping as a leisure activity is mostly a reminder of what you don\u2019t have rather than an activity that brings any sort of meaning and connection.\nThe organisations that do provide social value are small, local and arise organically, such as volunteer-run cafes and community gardens. They are the very opposite of the centralised state enterprises that the Corbyn cohort dream of. It may not have intended to, but Labour\u2019s pessimism has allowed Boris Johnson to surf this wave of optimism \u2013 as fraudulent as it may be \u2013 because it signals a break not so much with the EU but with \n.\nThis really matters in ways that politicians appear still not to get. If you talk only of bad things, it is hard to appear as someone who loves their country. If you largely speak of your constituents as victims then you disempower them. Corbyn and his acolytes really have owned their Eeyoreness. They\u2019ve made it easy for someone with a skewed but, yes, happier vision of the future to walk all over them.\n, a theory that says external circumstances make almost no difference to our own happiness, is flawed. No, I really don\u2019t want to hear anyone talk about their gratitude journal. Count your blessings in private. \nMany things are beyond our control, but actually the things most people give thanks for \u2013 friends and family and relationships and jobs and housing and money \u2013 do matter. Talking nonstop about austerity and the climate emergency and coming recession has not made people more energised or leftwing.\nInstead they have become passive and anxious. Jeremy Corbyn may as well stop doing prime minister\u2019s questions and just tunelessly sing Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now. Wellbeing, contentment \u2013 no one currently associates them with Labour. They seem like ideas from another age. They are lost.

While the Tory right and Labour left have been bursting with ideas about how to transform Britain, the self-styled moderates of both parties and their many media allies have suggested few concrete solutions to the crises in the economy, the climate and Britain\u2019s ever more divided society.\nThis negative approach hasn\u2019t worked. An ability to read and win over electorates used to be a hallmark of successful centrists, from Michael Heseltine to Tony Blair. But since the latter\u2019s increasingly distant heyday, centrism has suffered a succession of defeats: the Brexit referendum, the 2015 and 2016 Labour leadership races, the 2017 and 2019 general elections. Last year 21 centrist MPs were suspended from the Conservative party without it suffering electoral damage. In the current Labour leadership contest, since Jess Phillips\u2019s chastened withdrawal, there hasn\u2019t even been an openly centrist candidate.\nSocial liberalism used to be one of centrism\u2019s main principles. Yet at last year\u2019s election, Ian Austin and John Woodcock, former Labour MPs who had advertised their supposed moderation by becoming independents, \n Boris Johnson\u2019s xenophobic, authoritarian Toryism \u2013 as did the far right\u2019s Tommy Robinson. Once a dominant force in Britain and beyond, centrism now increasingly looks like a movement that has lost its bearings.\nIf they\u2019re going to become relevant again, centrists need to stop lamenting the fact that Britain hasn\u2019t become the haven of stable politics, social mobility and benign capitalism that they hoped and worked for during the 1990s. Instead, they need to come up with some new ideas, and a plan for achieving the power needed to apply them.\nThat might not be as difficult as it sounds. The current appetite among politicians and voters for radicalism, such as it is, won\u2019t last forever. A few years of Dominic Cummings experimenting on Britain may persuade many Tories that explicitly ideological, disruptive politics isn\u2019t such a good thing after all. And the Labour party\u2019s predominant focus on leftwing policies may not survive another general election defeat. In our impatient political world, the circumstances could be right, sooner than we imagine, for a modernised version of centrism to seem quite appealing.\nWhat might it consist of? There are a few signs that more forward-looking centrists are starting to think about this. On the website of Progress, a Labour pressure group usually associated with stubbornly unreconstructed Blairism, there is \n by Alison McGovern, the Labour MP and chair of Progress, which departs strikingly from previous centrist orthodoxies. \u201cWe no longer live in a global economy where we can guarantee that growth will benefit everyone,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe rigging of the market system in favour of monopoly capital has left many workers trapped.\u201d Labour must \u201credistribute power\u201d in the economy and \u201cconsider radical transfers\u201d of wealth.\nThe actual policies she proposes are either modest \u2013 \u201cmeans-tested baby bonds\u201d, or personal investment funds for the neediest, from birth \u2013 or tantalising sketches, \u201cgiving everyone shares in our nation\u2019s land wealth\u201d. But there is a sense of centrism belatedly coming to terms with today\u2019s ever more unequal and unsustainable world. Rather than the gradualism and weak compromises with the powerful which centrists previously favoured, perhaps they don\u2019t have to accept quite so much of the status quo.\nA similar seam of new thinking ran, almost unnoticed, through last year\u2019s Liberal Democrat manifesto. While the rest of its election campaign positioned the party as an alternative to \u201cextremist\u201d Labour \u2013 largely to the Tories\u2019 benefit \u2013 the manifesto was much less traditionally centrist. It proposed a more active role for the state and showed less reverence for the free market than the Lib Dems have had for decades. After a string of disastrous middle-of-the-road leaders, it\u2019s possible the party is becoming more adventurous again.\nIt\u2019s harder to envisage that happening to the few remaining Tory centrists. The Conservatives once had a confident and open-minded centrist tradition, exemplified by books such as The Middle Way, an eloquent call to reform capitalism published in 1938 by the future prime minister \n. But these days even the liberal Tory thinktank Bright Blue, which claims to be \u201cpro-market not free market\u201d, seems submissive to the right, with a website dominated by defences of Thatcherite policies such as the right to buy, and by calls for yet more economic deregulation. Especially for a party as prone to complacency as the Tories, the aftermath of a big election win tends not to be a time for nuanced thinking.\nIf you\u2019re on the left, it\u2019s easy to think that the crisis of centrism doesn\u2019t matter. You may well think it\u2019s a good thing. In recent years centrists have certainly done the left no favours. Before they got to work on Jeremy Corbyn, they undermined even Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown\u2019s much more tentative efforts to adapt Labour to the new world that the 2008 financial crisis created. Much is made of the sectarianism of some on the left; but it has a centrist mirror image.\nYet as all the remaining Labour leadership candidates seem to realise, judging by their carefully inclusive rhetoric, the left is probably going to have to join forces with the centre if Boris Johnson\u2019s xenophobia and authoritarianism is to be defeated. As for centrists who think they can beat the radical right without the left\u2019s help \u2013 or who still imagine they can replace the left \u2013 the best response probably is: you\u2019ve tried that.\n Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-britain-british-ethnic-minorities": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/shamima-begum-britain-british-ethnic-minorities", "title": "Shamima Begum is a product of Britain.

The ruling will no doubt be popular \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to have much sympathy with anyone who willingly signs up to the virulent misogyny and bloodlust of Isis. However, Begum\u2019s banishment throws up two major questions.\nFirst, we need to know why a straight-A teenager from east London would willingly leave Britain to embrace a death cult. It defies all reason. Somehow this child was groomed and radicalised, not in some far-away country bereft of democracy, but here on British soil and without the knowledge of her parents. Before condemning her we need to know how this naive teenager was pushed in this direction. If she\u2019d been sexually groomed at this age we would not be vilifying the victim.\nAnd, second, the British government\u2019s decision to sever her citizenship is in effect burying its head in the sand. Though Bangladesh has washed its hands of her, Javid, and his successor Priti Patel, still claim Begum can apply for citizenship in that country, where her parents were born. But she\u2019s a product of Britain, not of Bangladesh \u2013 a country she has never visited. Her rights as a British citizen \u2013 born here, raised here, and with an east London accent \u2013 should transcend the seriousness of her crime, and she should be tried on British soil. Doing otherwise sets a dangerous precedent.\nAnd, moreover, it sends a signal to all British ethnic minorities. Like many of us born here in families whose parents or grandparents migrated from abroad, Begum knows this country and no other. And until recently it\u2019s only been the far right who have questioned black and brown people\u2019s right to be here. But given that all ethnic minorities have family connections to other countries, it now places a question mark over all of our futures. Should we be convicted of a crime (and let\u2019s face it, our communities are already heavily policed and there\u2019s a long history of us being unfairly targeted by the criminal justice system), we may now face a double punishment \u2013 of deportation as well as the original sentencing.\nAs a British citizen myself, of Pakistani descent, is it fair that my citizenship rights could be stripped if I committed a crime, that I could be banished to a country where I have no tangible connections other than the fact my grandparents migrated from there decades ago? \nMore and more, the idea of \u201cBritishness\u201d seems to be squeezing out ethnic minorities, and especially our right to be who we are. We\u2019ve had a decade of attacks on multiculturalism; endless debate about \u201cBritish values\u201d, \n; we\u2019ve seen a \n since the Brexit referendum. And to cap it all, we\u2019ve had the Windrush scandal, and the election as prime minister of a man who insults Muslim women and black people. A British identity inclusive of black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities is dying right before our eyes.\nWhen I was growing up, my grandparents who migrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s \u2013 when the far right National Front loomed daily \u2013 spoke ominously of returning to Pakistan before the British government kicked them out. They were the generation who shuddered as they listened to Enoch Powell lament that \u201cin this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man\u201d.\nBegum\u2019s crime (for which she has yet to be tried) is grievous indeed. However, with this verdict upheld, the government message is loud and clear: play by the rules, or risk having your citizenship revoked. It seems my grandparents weren\u2019t as melodramatic as I thought after all.\n Aina Khan is a writer and playwright and a former presenter for British Muslim TV\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-scottish-politics-tough-new-tests-all-round": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-scottish-politics-tough-new-tests-all-round", "title": "The Guardian view on Scottish politics: tough new tests all round | Editorial", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 18:30:15 GMT", "summary": "The scandal over Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct is only one of the challenges facing the party and its opponents, despite the opportunity afforded by Brexit<p>In UK terms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/derek-mackay-scottish-finance-secretary-quits-over-messages-to-boy-16\" title=\"\">Derek Mackay</a> is not a high-profile politician.

With the former leader Alex Salmond soon to face trial for alleged sexual offences, the Mackay scandal was the last thing that Ms Sturgeon wanted. Now it is suddenly a key part of a major set of tests for the first minister, her judgment, her party and her government.\nThe pivotal question is whether and how far these other issues disrupt or override the anger of Scottish voters that EU withdrawal is being imposed by a Conservative party whose governing majority is drawn from elsewhere. The first minister sees this as an injustice for which the best remedy is \n \u2013 but she sees that as the remedy to everything, which diminishes the potency of the argument.\nBrexit gives nationalists a resonant new grievance. It does not improve the economic case for independence or make it easier to achieve. But the pro-independence side\u2019s defeat in the 2014 referendum is a bigger problem for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Johnson never tires of pointing out that the SNP recognised the once-per-generation status of that ballot. Mr Johnson is a terrible messenger for unionism \u2013 a caricature of English Tory arrogance \u2013 but he is not wrong to remind nationalists that \n recently chose to stay in the UK. Many Scottish voters think a first minister\u2019s energies might more usefully be spent governing than demanding a referendum rematch.\nMs Sturgeon\u2019s riposte is that Brexit has changed facts and minds, so the rematch is democratically imperative. Some \n indicate a slender pro-independence majority, with a pivotal shift in that direction caused by a migration of EU remainers who voted no in 2014. Ms Sturgeon wants to ride that mood to victory in next year\u2019s Scottish parliament elections. Such a result would, she believes, signal enough backing for a second referendum that Mr Johnson would be obliged to grant one. More radical nationalists believe Westminster\u2019s permission is not required, but legally it is. The first minister is wise to stick to the letter of the law. An aggressive snatch for independence would suffocate Scotland\u2019s prospects of one day rejoining the EU. \nThe long game has mostly suited the SNP, but it has limits. When the Holyrood poll comes around, the party will have been governing for 14 years and gaps in its record cannot be ignored. Scottish schoolchildren \n in literacy and numeracy tests relative to their English peers. Scottish \n is bogged down in a crisis so acute that the chair of the watchdog authority washed her hands of it in December. Tory austerity is the SNP\u2019s default excuse for poor services but public spending is around 20% higher per capita than in England. Ms Sturgeon cannot shrug off the weight of incumbency indefinitely. The Mackay scandal makes that attempt much more difficult than it was already.\nWhatever difficulties the SNP faces, it is blessed with weak and incompetent enemies. Under \n, Labour blurred its position on a second referendum and has yet to regain focus. Mr Johnson\u2019s lines are crisp, but his crass manner boosts the separatist cause. If the case for preserving a United Kingdom is monopolised by a Tory party pumped up on Brexit, the argument will fall flat. That case should stand above party loyalties. It should escape the arena of competing nationalisms \u2013 English and Scottish \u2013 and appeal to a wider sense of shared history and collective endeavour. Sadly, leaders who are gifted at expressing that vision are in short supply. The arguments are not well rehearsed. Supporters of the EU discovered the equivalent weakness of their position too late. Believers in a United Kingdom must not make the same mistake.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/power-everything-progressives-boris-johnson-donald-trump": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/power-everything-progressives-boris-johnson-donald-trump", "title": "Power is everything \u2013 and progressives forget that at their peril | Jonathan Freedland", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:08:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>As Boris Johnson and Donald Trump know, winning gives you the ability not just to pass laws but to make the weather</p><p>You take comfort where you can.

When a single week can see Britain leave the European Union and \n bragging and swaggering in vengeful celebration as he escapes punishment for a high crime he clearly committed, the need for soothing can become intense. One such solace is that, despite the concrete defeats visible all around us, the left is somehow \u201cwinning the argument\u201d.\nThat view lives on in corners of the British Labour party. Witness those diehard followers of the party leader, \n that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to nationalise Northern Rail or introduce free hospital parking proves that it was Jeremy Corbyn who really won the big contest of December 2019. Perhaps those devotees didn\u2019t notice the key words in that sentence: \u201cPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u201d.\nIn the US, a more defensible version of this attempt to find sunshine in the gloom centres on the observation that politics exists downstream from culture, and that while three of the four institutions of the US government (the presidency, the Senate and the supreme court) are in the hands of the right, at least power over the commanding heights of the culture \u2013 the media, the Academy, entertainment \u2013 lies elsewhere. On this view, Trump might well retain the White House in November, even if he once again loses the popular vote; just as Republicans enjoy a \n in the Senate, even as they regularly win far fewer votes for that body too \u2013 but liberals will always have Hollywood.\nHowever, these comforts are delusional. If recent events have reminded us of anything, it\u2019s that in politics, power is the whole ballgame. \nIn the US, Trump is crowing that he has succeeded where his predecessors failed by coming up with a Middle East \n that represents a \u201chistoric breakthrough\u201d in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The quote marks around those phrases are doing some very heavy lifting. It\u2019s not a peace plan at all, but rather a \n for the wishlist of one side of the conflict \u2013 namely, the Israelis \u2013 or, more accurately, for the most extreme elements of that one side. Naturally, no Palestinians agreed to this plan, nor was a single Palestinian present at the unveiling.\nTo greet it as a historic breakthrough was an absurdity that would have made Lewis Carroll blush. To watch Trump applaud his achievement was to watch a football manager praising his side for winning 10-0 when they were the only team on the field and the opposing goal was open and empty. If only Obama, Bush Jr, Clinton, Bush Sr, Reagan or Carter had realised that success meant simply giving one side all it wanted, why, they could have negotiated a historic breakthrough decades ago.\nObviously the Trump peace plan will fail if its objective is to bring peace. But if its true aim is to reframe the conflict, to redefine the parameters of any future negotiation away from the two-state solution that has long been the international consensus and towards an arrangement that will allow \n to annex all the bits of the West Bank it wants, leaving Palestinians with a fragmented, Swiss cheese of a state comprised of disconnected enclaves, then its prospects are much healthier.\nLike it or not, Trump\u2019s ludicrously (and dangerously) unjust plan will be the starting point for any future US administration. If an incoming US president wants to adopt any halfway credible plan, they will first have to rescind many or most of the concessions to Israel that Trump granted \u2013 and that will cost political capital. Thus has Trump already left a lasting imprint on that corner of the Middle East, inflicting yet more loss on a people, the Palestinians, who have already lost so much.\nIn Britain, the damage is of a less lethal variety, but still deadly serious. Johnson\u2019s government is stepping up its \n, seeking to erode public support for the licence fee that funds it and boycotting its flagship news programmes. This week it widened its attack to include other news organisations, and indeed the principle of a free and independent press, by \n which outlets are and are not allowed to cover it, a move lifted straight from the Bumper Book of Trump. The effect could be a fundamental reshaping of the British media landscape, altering the way this society learns about itself and, in turn, how its democracy functions.\nThe point here is that neither Trump\u2019s anti-peace plan nor Johnson\u2019s assault on the BBC were the policies on which those men were elected; they were not in their party platforms or manifestos. And yet they illustrate the power of elected office, not simply to implement a stated programme but to make the weather, to set the terms of trade. Most significant of all, a party in power has the ability to create the conditions that ensure it keeps it.\nThe anti-BBC project is an example, aimed at weakening a source of accountability that might otherwise make life harder for this Tory government. The looming threat to the UK judiciary is another, as Johnson \n for last autumn\u2019s supreme court ruling, which voided his unlawful suspension of parliament. Armed with a Commons majority of 80, the prime minister now has the power to shrink that potential check on his authority. In the US, control of the presidency and the Senate has allowed Republicans to remake the supreme court in their image, so that it hands down rulings \u2013 on \n, for example \u2013 that help them and hurt their opponents. \nIt\u2019s understanding the power of power, a truth so obvious that it should barely need stating, that is driving some battle-hardened veterans of past left campaigns to despair. \u201cNothing. Without power, there is nothing,\u201d \n, who ran the last successful Democratic effort to oust a sitting Republican president when he masterminded Bill Clinton\u2019s victory back in 1992. He\u2019s alarmed that some of his fellow Democrats seem to be downgrading, if not actively disdaining, \u201celectability\u201d as a criterion in choosing their nominee. For him it is the first, most fundamental requirement. As he put it after this week\u2019s Iowa fiasco, the only consideration that matters is a candidate\u2019s ability to beat Trump \u2013 because \u201cthere\u2019s only one moral imperative and that is to beat Donald Trump\u201d.\nOf course, \u201celectability\u201d is a hard thing to prove for certain until it\u2019s tested (by which time it\u2019s too late). But the first step is to accept its importance, to recognise that winning power is the sine qua non of politics, literally the thing without which there is nothing. Labour deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon might worry that party members will panic and \u201cjust \n for whatever is most conventionally electable\u201d, rather than opting for the most \u201cradical\u201d wishlist of promises, but there is a ready response to that. Labour\u2019s experiment with the not \u201cconventionally electable\u201d ended in a conventional crushing two months ago \u2013 and there is nothing socialist or radical about that. Its only achievement was to grant the Tories five more years \u2013 and the power to reshape the world around them.\n Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/can-boris-johnson-be-trusted-to-act-on-climate-the-crisis": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/can-boris-johnson-be-trusted-to-act-on-climate-the-crisis", "title": "Can Boris Johnson be trusted to act on the climate crisis?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:47:19 GMT", "summary": "<p>He has a history of \u2018not getting\u2019 global heating but his desire for Britain to be a world leader could be the planet\u2019s hope</p><p>Will Boris Johnson please listen to his own father, rather than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s climate sceptic brother, on the subject of climate change?

That much was clear this week \n of the COP 26 UN climate summit, which will take place in Glasgow in November. This will be the most important international conference in five years and as host the UK will play a leading role in deciding whether it ends in success or failure.\nThe event was overshadowed by \n Claire O\u2019Neill, who responded with a scathing takedown of a premier who she described as \n, failing to devote sufficient resources to summit preparations, and being fundamentally untrustworthy.\nThe firing was not all bad news. O\u2019Neill lacked the political heft and diplomatic skill needed to forge a global consensus on this most divisive of issues. If a more senior politician is appointed in her place, it would show the UK is taking preparations more seriously. The fact that the prime minister is fronting the launch demonstrates an investment of political capital that is commensurate with the challenge.\nHe also \n, most concretely by confirming the UK\u2019s commitment to go net-zero on carbon emissions by 2050. \u201cOf course it\u2019s expensive, of course it\u2019s difficult, it will require thought and change and action, people will say it\u2019s impossible and it can\u2019t be done, and my message to you all this morning is that they are wrong,\u201d he declared. \u201cI hope it will be a defining year of action for our country, and indeed for our planet, on tackling climate change but also on protecting the natural world.\u201d\nBut can he be trusted and can he deliver? On that question, almost all the evidence \u2013 from parliamentary voting records and donations from climate sceptics to his newspaper columns and performance as mayor \u2013 says no.\nAlthough Johnson has repeatedly called for reduced emissions, \n in the Guardian\u2019s climate scorecards last year based on his rejection of actions that would achieve this in five key parliamentary votes. This includes opposition to onshore wind subsidies, emissions-based vehicle taxes and carbon capture and storage.\nHe was also shown to have \n of \u00a35,000 from Michael Hintze and \u00a325,000 from Terence Mordaunt (via First Corporate Shipping), who fund the climate science sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation.\nThe Conservative party says the Guardian cherry-picked votes and failed to recognise Johnson\u2019s support for the net zero emissions target. The Guardian stands by its methodology, which \n.\nOther broader data sources confirm the prime minister\u2019s woeful record on parliament. \n that Johnson has \u201calmost always voted against measures to prevent climate change\u201d with one vote in favour, eight against and six absences (the latter largely due to his period as mayor of London).\nThe gulf between words and deeds was also evident when Johnson was foreign minister, when he oversaw a 60% cut in the UK\u2019s team of climate attaches across the world from 165 to 65, just as the UK was supposed to be delivering the Paris agreement. He then tried to hush up what happened, \n, who claimed Johnson also ignored his advice to be more publicly supportive of climate change and misled the public about King\u2019s agreement to chair an inquiry into building an airport in the Thames estuary.\nWhile mayor of London, his record was mixed. On the positive side, he electrified the bus fleet, raised diesel charges, improved cycling networks and encouraged tree planting and zero-emission taxis. But he also held back a report on the impact of air pollution on deprived schools and curtailed a western extension of the congestion charge zone, which could have reduced traffic and improved air quality.\nHis most famous green boast was that he would lie down in front of bulldozers to prevent a third runway being built at Heathrow airport. But was absent during the 2018 vote on this issue, and strongly supported his own pet airport project \u2013 a four-runway mega-terminal in the Thames estuary that never got off the ground.\nJohnson\u2019s \n provide copious proof that he does not \u201cget\u201d climate change. In 2012, he described wind farms as \u201cwhite satanic mills\u201d, supported shale gas fracking and \n who warn of the dangers of emissions.\nOn three occasions, he blithely \u2013 and completely wrongly \u2013 claimed global heating was primarily caused by solar activity. \u201cWhatever is happening to the weather at the moment, it is nothing to do with the conventional doctrine of climate change,\u201d he wrote in 2015, citing the debunked claims of the climate sceptic \n \u2013 the brother of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. He was scoring points against a political opponent by dismissing the consensus view among scientists that the climate crisis is driven by human activity.\nThe prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, is, by contrast, a committed environmentalist who has campaigned for faster action on climate change. At an Extinction Rebellion demonstration last year \n to wear the badge of \u201cnon cooperative crusties\u201d, which was the criticism levelled by his son at protesters. His influence is apparent in Boris Johnson\u2019s endorsement of various wildlife campaigns, which he presents in colonial fashion as the fault of other nations. A quick glance at his backlist of articles reveals attacks on Japan for whaling, China for the slaughter of pangolins, and a belief that African elephants and cheetahs need to be saved by the UK.\nOn the basis of his diplomatic clumsiness, poor grasp of science and voting record, Johnson appears to be the worst man for the job of making COP 26 a success. But, beyond his dad, there are two other reasons to hope that he might yet turn the pig\u2019s ear of preparations into a silk purse of an event. If the democrat in him \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly in his adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2013 decides strong climate action is the will of the electorate (as polls overwhelmingly suggest), then he could demonstrate this by pushing it through with the same determination as Brexit. And if the patriot in him makes up his mind to make the UK a global leader in solving the greatest challenge of our age, then he will recognise the need to appoint a strong candidate to replace O\u2019Neill.\nIn this week\u2019s speech, he alluded to this in an encouraging recognition of the UK\u2019s responsibility to decarbonise. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite proper that we should, we were the first, after all, to industrialise. Look at historic emissions of the UK, we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way and to do this,\u201d he said.\nSadly it seems more likely, given his own history and \n, that Johnson will put political partisanship first and bow to pressure from the US to downplay climate concerns in return for a trade deal, and from his donors and supporters to weaken EU environmental standards so the UK economy is more competitive after Brexit.\nFather will not approve.

Over the next three years the couple had two children, both of whom had died, and Begum was nine months pregnant with their third when, last February, she was rediscovered in another refugee camp \n.\nBegum had fled the battle of Baghuz, where Isis was making its last stand. \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming here,\u201d she said, referring to her original decision to travel to Syria, but added: \u201cNow all I want to do is to come home to Britain.\u201d\nSix days later, Javid revoked her British citizenship, arguing that she had the right to take Bangladeshi citizenship via her parents, even though she had never visited the country and did not speak its official language, Bengali.\nBegum was one of more than 100 Britons who travelled to join Isis to be treated this way, and \n. \u201cWhatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for,\u201d he said.\nShortly after Javid\u2019s decision, Begum gave birth to a son, Jarrah. But disease was rife in the insanitary conditions of the sprawling al-Hawl camp where they were living. It was labelled the \u201ccamp of death\u201d because so many children had died there, and Jarrah became one of them, contracting pneumonia and dying 10 days later.\nThe national security argument heard in court was that Begum had aligned with the Islamist group not only by travelling to Syria but by remaining until nearly the last days of the self-styled caliphate, thus showing a high degree of commitment to it.\nSecurity sources have gone further, suggesting Begum was \n, during which time she carried a Kalashnikov and had a reputation for strictness. Begum also allegedly \u201cstitched suicide bombers into explosive vests\u201d. These are all claims the intelligence community stands by, arguing that women are as capable as men of actively participating in a violent regime.\nIn the citizenship hearing, Begum\u2019s lawyers said it was difficult to obtain information from their client that would enable them to comprehensively defend her. \u201cIt is not possible to take instructions on her intentions, the circumstances in which she left, what she has been doing, family relations and so forth,\u201d her barrister, Tom Hickman QC, said during the four-day hearing in October.\nThe exact truth may never be properly examined, given the immigration tribunal\u2019s verdict on Friday. However, if Begum were to win her appeal against it, and somehow return to the UK, security sources have indicated she would almost certainly face a terrorism trial.\nThat said, they argue, it would be difficult to obtain evidence from Syria that could stand up in a British court. The likelihood is that the most serious charge that could be levied against her would be membership of a banned organisation, Isis, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.\nLess than a week after the terrorist stabbing in Streatham, and with ministers also pushing through emergency legislation to \n for terror offenders, Conservative politicians feel their hard line on Begum is not only justified but politically popular.\nMore broadly, the government is refusing to repatriate any of the 60 or so men and women from the UK being held in prisons and camps in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria \u2013 and depriving them of citizenship where possible. In one case, the Home Office is willing to allow four children, all under 10, to return to the UK, \n.\nIt fell to Begum\u2019s lawyers to make an alternative argument. Daniel Furner, of Birnberg Peirce, said some other countries \u201cdealing with similar cases, in particular of very young women, have found safe, sensible and humane ways of returning and reintegrating their citizens quietly, and with expert advice, into a normal existence\u201d.\nLegal proceedings, Furner concluded, \u201cfail to provide swift and practical answers to such acute human predicaments as this\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/trade-deal-trump-america-uk-climate-ambitions-2050": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/trade-deal-trump-america-uk-climate-ambitions-2050", "title": "A trade deal with Trump\u2019s America would shred Britain\u2019s climate ambitions | Stephen Buranyi", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:04:38 GMT", "summary": "<p>The US will most likely try to lock in protections for its fossil fuel industry, jeopardising plans to decarbonise the UK by 2050</p><p>Few things have loomed larger in Brexit imaginary than the stupendous trade deals the UK will get as soon as it frees itself from the thicket of European Union regulation.

The US will push aggressively against anything that blocks American companies from doing business here, and there are few things on which the two countries are more divided than climate policy.\nThe UK has ambitious plans to \n, while the US has little policy and no targets to speak of. So the government will struggle to come to an agreement without sacrificing its already fragile climate commitments. Trade deals are increasingly about \n (a very EU-ey word) of standards and regulations to allow foreign goods and services into our borders. And it won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that alignment with the US rarely leads to stronger regulation; instead, trade agreements often act as a powerful and undemocratic tool to erode or supersede existing protections.\nThe common example is the fear of poorly checked, \n being sold in the UK. But the gulf between the US and UK on climate is even larger than on food standards. Documents from a 2018 meeting, leaked in November, set out a harsh starting position: the US will \n or include the term in any deal, which means it won\u2019t consider existing climate policies legitimate grounds for opposition to any of its demands.\nThis suggests the American negotiators will push to weaken existing low-carbon standards, or worse \u2013 given the UK has many climate targets but little actual concrete policy as yet \u2013 lock in clauses favourable to the fossil fuel industry that can\u2019t be easily overturned by domestic legislation. This would effectively head off climate policy before it can be written. A similar thing played out before negotiations when the UK was part of the EU: in the now stalled \n (TTIP), the US pushed for wording that would prevent initiatives to help renewables compete with fossil fuels. That demand is likely to be repeated, with the American fossil fuel industry keen to get fracked gas as well as \n into the UK.\nThe government\u2019s recent fracking ban could also come under pressure from US companies looking to operate here. In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation.\nPerhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an \n \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of \n under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011.\nWith an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes.\nClimate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts. But \n, the minister in charge of negotiations, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are deregulators of the highest order. Both were co-authors of the 2012 book \n, which criticised the UK for a \u201cbloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation\u201d. They maintain that the government is committed to its existing climate targets, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll actually back the protections we need in order to meet them.\n Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/government-imploding-may-boris-johnson-exclude-journalists-john-crace-digested-week": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/government-imploding-may-boris-johnson-exclude-journalists-john-crace-digested-week", "title": "Even when her government was imploding, May never tried to exclude me | John Crace", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:08:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>All governments try to control by giving access to favoured journalists, but Boris Johnson is taking it to new levels</p><p>It had felt like something of a no-brainer when the Premier League changed the kick-off of Spurs\u2019 game against last season\u2019s champions, Manchester City, to suit the Sky TV schedules.

Why would I want to put myself through the pain of watching my team get annihilated when I also had tickets to see Ermonela Jaho give her debut recital at Wigmore Hall on the same day and there wasn\u2019t enough time to do both?\nBut watching the match on TV (well, all but the last 10 minutes) before we headed off into central London, I began to have my doubts. This was the game in which Spurs managed to concentrate their entire season\u2019s good luck \n. Man City totally dominated the game, while Spurs, despite playing just as indifferently as they have for most of the season, scored from the only two shots they had in the first 89 minutes. It was the jammiest 2-0 win you will ever see and Spurs now only need another three points to be sure of avoiding relegation. Surely even they can\u2019t screw this up?\nBut once at the concert I knew I had made the right call. Two hours of the most sublime music making. Jaho is the world\u2019s finest soprano. End of. Her ability to inhabit the roles she sings is astonishing, as is her vocal range. No one can break your heart with a floated note while tears stream down her face quite like her.

At a lobby briefing on Monday, No 10 had divided the journalists into two sections on either side of the carpet and told one lot that they were being kicked out. After a brief row, \n. No 10 then tried to spin the walkout as a misunderstanding: the briefing had been for specialists only \u2013 but the only specialist present was among those who had been refused access.\nEarlier in the day I had \n of a Downing Street exclusion order when I was banned from attending the prime minister\u2019s Brexit speech in Greenwich. The official version was that it was \u201cstrictly one journalist per media outlet\u201d and the Guardian already had someone going. Only the Times was mysteriously allowed two journalists. A colleague who was there took a photo of several rows of empty seats.\nAll governments try to control the media agenda by granting special access to favoured journalists who they trust not to question their side of the story, but Boris and Classic Dom are taking it to new levels. Even when her government was imploding Theresa May never tried to exclude me from anything to which other sketch writers were invited.\nPreparations to host COP 26, the UN climate change conference, in Glasgow later this year appear to be in total disarray \n, Claire O\u2019Neill, as head of the UK\u2019s organisation team. No 10 has claimed O\u2019Neill was not up to the job, while she has told the media that the government was hopelessly disengaged from COP26 and Boris Johnson didn\u2019t really understand the realities of climate change. Since then it has emerged that David Cameron was offered O\u2019Neill\u2019s job but \n. Maybe, too, the money on offer just wasn\u2019t enough for him to rearrange his diary. It\u2019s now emerged that \n \u2013 probably a great deal more \u2013 from various well-paid gigs that appear to have required little effort between leaving office in 2016 and April last year. Brexit has certainly been extremely kind to his bank balance. As it has to May. For the current register of interests shows that since stepping down as prime minister in July last year, May has earned \u00a3400,000 in addition to her MP salary. Bizarrely, the bulk of that money has come from public speaking. For one speech to JP Morgan Chase in London that would have taken up a maximum of five hours in preparation, travel and delivery time, May trousered a mere \u00a375K. Since there can\u2019t be anyone who hasn\u2019t \n, one can only assume the former PM was hired as a comedy or curiosity act. There are few people who can lose an audience quite so quickly as May. So, as someone who has done as much anyone to publicise May\u2019s difficulties with sentence construction and absence of meaning, I\u2019m now waiting for my 15% commission. It would be my own Brexit bounce.\nDon Powell, Slade\u2019s drummer for the best part of 60 years, claims \n. You\u2019d have thought the frontman, Dave Hill, might have at least chosen to end such a long relationship by FaceTime but perhaps he only does that for people he has known for 75 years. Presumably, Dave still considered Don to be a relative newcomer to the band. Bizarrely, for someone who was pathologically unreliable and totally disengaged throughout my 20s while doing a series of jobs in which my employers clearly regretted my existence almost as much as I did, I have only ever been sacked once. And that was totally deserved and done face to face. It was during the heatwave of 1976 and I was working an ice cream machine, that would have failed all current health and safety legislation, outside a souvenir shop in Leicester Square. After a couple of months my time-keeping had become increasingly erratic \u2013 principally because I was up most nights taking large quantities of every drug on offer and was finding it harder and harder to fit in a job around my antisocial life. One afternoon I was startled to get a tap on my shoulder. My boss had been doing his rounds \u2013 he owned numerous concessions in the West End \u2013 and had found me passed out while propped up against the ice cream machine. He didn\u2019t even bother to shout at me. He just gave me a weary look of resignation and politely told me it was time I went home and didn\u2019t come back. I could only agree. I\u2019m not sure who was more relieved, him or me.\nIt seems hard to believe that it is still only early February as the year seems to be dragging by. Not that I have managed to achieve that much while time has slowed down. Rather, my inner world has been dominated with feelings of acute anxiety, depression and a sense of futility. On many days it has been a real battle to get out of bed. Things that should provide pleasure have felt increasingly transient and out of reach while even my dreams have given me no respite from a feeling of dread. At times I have felt as if I was doing little more than existing. Going through the motions of being John. Or a barely remembered version of John. I\u2019ve been too depressed even to worry about getting \n. As ever, my family have done more than their fair share of holding me together. As have friends and work colleagues, and seeing the garden coming to life each day always gives me a moment\u2019s buzz. If the bananas, palms and echiums can survive the winter, then so can I. But I\u2019ve also had so much support from so many readers. Some have sent random gifts, such as old Spurs photographs from the 60s and 70s, others have written emails of encouragement. Just last week I had dozens of emails telling me where I could \n. Come the spring, I\u2019m off to either Brownsea Island or the Isle of Wight and will report back. Only last night at a book event in Haslemere, a reader gave me a pot made from the clay under the old White Hart Lane pitch more than 100 years ago. The gift couldn\u2019t have been more perfect, combining my passion for football and ceramics. So a big thank you to all of you for helping keep me sane.

It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is usual for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.\nYou cannot do anything in Westminster without a bit of pomp and circumstance. A ceremony of prorogation involves a message from the Queen being read in the \n, and then Black Rod summoning MPs from the Commons to the Lords. A list of all the bills passed by the parliament is read, followed by a speech on behalf of the Queen announcing what has been achieved by the government before MPs are sent home. Given what is on the order paper in parliament on Monday, this is likely to happen very late this evening.\nThere are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week.\n includes a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held, but is nevertheless longer than usual.\nMost obviously, though, the country is approaching the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU. Parliament has been working to pass a law that would prevent the UK crashing out without a deal, regardless of the fact that Boris Johnson has promised to leave on that date \u201c\n\u201d. With no deal agreed, and noises off suggesting the government might ignore any law requiring them to agree an extension with the EU, some politicians have been dismayed that parliament will not be sitting while the situation remains unresolved.\nAll work on legislation going through parliament stops.

In Joensuu, the compact city in eastern \n, where I am now, it\u2019s arguably a more serious business.\nWhen I got off the train from Helsinki the temperature was -16C (3F), and hasn\u2019t yet risen higher than -6C. Every roadway, pavement and cycle route is covered in a layer of compacted snow.\nYet, one of the first things you see on the city\u2019s streets are bikes. About 20% of all trips in Joensuu are cycled. This drops by about half in the depths of winter but that\u2019s still far better than most Finnish cities, let alone almost anywhere in the UK.\nI\u2019m in Joensuu because I was invited to come and see the \n, an annual gathering of researchers, academics and city officials, which is hosted by a different chilly municipality every year.\nAfter a couple of days of speaking to people here, two main lessons have emerged. Firstly, while winter cycling does bring its challenges, these are not always the ones you might expect. Secondly, and this is perhaps more predictable, if you want more people on bikes in winter, it\u2019s less about individuals than infrastructure.\nIn terms of the practicalities of riding on snow, Joensuu-like conditions of compacted snow are pretty easy. Almost everyone I\u2019ve seen pedalling around this week has been using everyday bikes with ordinary tyres.\nAri Varonen, the city\u2019s chief roads engineer, told me that Joensuu\u2019s bike routes are ploughed with the same tractors used for roads. They have a blade to push away fresh snow and add grooves to the surface to make it less slippery. The lanes are then gritted, rather than using bike-corroding salt.\nIf the weather stays below freezing, all is fine. But as Matti Koistinen, head of the Finnish Cyclists\u2019 Federation, explained to me, more varied temperatures are what cause the biggest problems.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s really packed snow, like it is now, it\u2019s comfortable to ride on. But when the temperature goes above 0C it becomes hell. It becomes very slushy, and then when it freezes again it\u2019s pure ice, and really bouncy.\u201d\nAt this point, the consensus seems, it is best to only venture out on a bike with tyres fitted with metal studs, given you can never be sure if a newly refrozen track has been freshly gritted.\nJoensuu has several advantages as a cycling city. It is relatively small, almost entirely flat, and its wide streets were mainly built in recent decades \u2013 as recently as the 1950s it only had a population of about 7,000.\nBut it also has a comprehensive system of separated cycle routes, some just for bikes, others as part of a wide footway. This is particularly crucial, Varonen told me: \u201cA bike lane just painted on the road wouldn\u2019t work here in winter time. If you have packed snow, you can\u2019t even see the marks. So no one would use it.\u201d\nAgain, we come back to a perennial theme of the bike blog: if you want a lot of people to cycle, you need consistent political will to spend money on proper cycling facilities over the long term.\nThat politicians in Joensuu are committed to cycling, and active transport more generally, is clear from the Winter \n Congress. The city\u2019s mayor, Kari Karjalainen, not only greeted delegates at an opening reception but took his turn pedalling the static bike used to power the event\u2019s PA system.\nThere are good reasons for this. Joensuu has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2025, a target it will not manage without significantly reducing transport emissions, which make up 70% of the total.\nThe Finnish government appears equally committed, with a funding programme in place for active travel as part of a target to increase walking and cycling by 30% by 2030. The country as a whole has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2030, 20 years before the UK\u2019s deadline.\nWhile cycling groups in Britain are generally marginalised by the government, Koistinen sits as a representative of the cyclists\u2019 federation on the official committee tasked with coming up with ways to reduce emissions.\nA pitfall of endlessly detailing forward-thinking policies in places such as Joensuu is that people in other countries can be tempted to shrug their shoulders and just assume, well, the Finns do things differently.\nAnd to an extent they do: North Karelia, the Finnish region of which Joensuu is the capital was the base for one of the earliest and \n, when 20 years of efforts led to a drop in historically high rates of heart disease, caused by rampant smoking and a diet largely based around animal fats, by about 80%.\nBut you could take another lesson. The opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress took place at the city\u2019s main school where, the teachers say, about half of pupils still ride to school in winter. On the morning in question, it was -13C and snowing. But the school\u2019s bike racks were full.\nThat\u2019s perhaps something to think about next time you wonder whether you can face a bike ride in winter.\n"}}, "Business": {"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/credit-suisse-chief-tidjane-thiam-ousted-after-spying-scandal": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/credit-suisse-chief-tidjane-thiam-ousted-after-spying-scandal", "title": "Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam ousted after spying scandal", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 07:30:36 GMT", "summary": "<p>The 57-year-old loses boardroom battle with Thomas Gottstein set to replace him</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/tidjane-thiam-the-top-ftse-100-boss-ousted-after-spying-scandal\">Profile: man who traded politics for finance after military coup</a></li></ul><p>The Credit Suisse chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/tidjane-thiam-the-top-ftse-100-boss-ousted-after-spying-scandal\">Tidjane Thiam</a>, has been ousted in the wake of a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and personal vendettas that has sent shockwaves through Switzerland\u2019s famously discreet banking community.</p><p>Thiam, widely seen as one of the finance world\u2019s leading lights, resigned after losing a boardroom battle that erupted when the bank admitted to having hired private detectives to spy on former staff.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/credit-suisse-chief-tidjane-thiam-ousted-after-spying-scandal\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The Credit Suisse chief executive, \n, has been ousted in the wake of a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and personal vendettas that has sent shockwaves through Switzerland\u2019s famously discreet banking community.\nThiam, widely seen as one of the finance world\u2019s leading lights, resigned after losing a boardroom battle that erupted when the bank admitted to having hired private detectives to spy on former staff.\nThe bank\u2019s board announced on Friday that it had \u201cunanimously accepted\u201d the 57-year-old\u2019s resignation and that Thomas Gottstein, the head of Credit Suisse\u2019s domestic business in \n, will take over as chief executive.\nWhile directors backed the departure of the bank\u2019s French-Ivorian boss, who was paid Sfr 12.7m (\u00a310m) last year for his services, they swung behind Urs Rohner, its Switzerland-born chairman.\nRohner is expected to complete a term scheduled to last until April 2021, despite the intervention of the bank\u2019s biggest investor on Friday, who called for the chairman to fall on his sword as well.\nThiam and Rohner have been at loggerheads since it emerged last year the Zurich-based bank had \n, the former head of the bank\u2019s wealth management division.\nKhan was on leave from Credit Suisse before taking a job at arch-rival UBS. Credit Suisse insisted the use of private detectives was a one-off incident but then in December admitted \n. Rohner said on Friday that the emergence of the second spying case had \u201cmade the situation worse\u201d and had forced the board to act.\nAs rumours swirled about the genesis of the affair, sources told the Financial Times last year that Khan\u2019s departure from \n followed a period in which he and Thiam had developed a personal animus towards one another.\nKhan was a rising star within the bank who was often talked about as a potential successor to Thiam, thanks to his success leading a wealth management division that enjoyed increasing profits and a burgeoning global reputation. While the pair got on well at first, they allegedly clashed outside the office over issues that arose between them as next-door neighbours in the Herrliberg area of the so-called \u201cgold coast\u201d of Lake Zurich.\nThiam complained to the bank about the inconvenience caused by lengthy renovations to Khan\u2019s home, the FT said.\nKhan later clashed with Thiam\u2019s partner during a cocktail party, in a disagreement that supposedly revolved around some trees planted on the Thiam property. During a subsequent confrontation, the two men had to be physically separated, Khan told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.\nAs a result of their personal feud, Khan, who was also said to have been frustrated with his lack of profile at the bank, was reportedly allowed to leave with a shorter notice period than would usually apply. The bank then hired private investigators to follow him, amid concern he might poach talented staff from Credit Suisse.\nKhan has alleged that three men employed by private security firm Investigo chased him and his wife through the streets of Zurich in a car, leading to a physical confrontation. Investigo has said there was only one man, that it was Khan who did the chasing and that its staff kept their distance.\nRohner initially supported Thiam over the affair but when it emerged that a second executive had been under surveillance \u2013 Peter Goerke, the former head of HR at Credit Suisse \u2013 relations between the two became strained.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, Credit Suisse\u2019s largest investor suggested that Thiam may have encountered racial bias in the Swiss banking industry.\nDavid Herro of Harris Associates said: \u201cTo be very frank, it seems [like] envy from competitors or perhaps something else given that Mr Thiam looks a little bit different than the typical Swiss banker. Either one of these two rationales behind these attacks against him, to me are extremely distasteful.\u201d Herro added on Friday that he believed Rohner should follow Thiam out of the bank.\nAn investigation by an external law firm in October formally cleared Thiam of involvement in the Khan spying affair and resulted in Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e, the chief operating officer and Thiam\u2019s closest ally, being fired over the Khan dispute.\nIt also emerged that a private security consultant who had helped Bou\u00e9e organise the spying had apparently killed himself.\nEarlier this week Thiam appeared to have the upper hand in Rohner\u2019s attempt to oust him, gaining the backing of several top Credit Suisse shareholders.\nHowever, on Friday he said he had agreed with the board to step down as chief executive. \u201cI had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place.\u201d\nThiam will step down after presenting the bank\u2019s annual results next week. The news of his departure sent Credit Suisse\u2019s share price down 4% in early trading but the stock later recovered its losses.\nRohner told Swiss radio: \u201cAt some point we realised that we couldn\u2019t get out of this situation unless we made a change and \n understood that too.\n\u201cTidjane has made an enormous contribution to Credit Suisse since he joined us in 2015. It is to his credit that Credit Suisse is standing on a very solid foundation and has returned successfully to profit.\u201d\nDismissing suggestions of xenophobia in appointing a Swiss successor to Thiam, Rohner said of Gottstein: \u201cOne thing that was not a factor was the colour of his passport,\u201d he said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-house-prices-rising-property-market-halifax": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/07/uk-house-prices-rising-property-market-halifax", "title": "UK house prices rising at fastest rate since February 2018", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:03:56 GMT", "summary": "<p>Halifax shows rate of growth at 4.1%, partly due to sales delayed amid 2019 uncertainty</p><p>UK house prices are rising at their fastest annual rate for nearly two years, according to Halifax, prompting claims that the property market is heading into the crucial spring season in reasonable shape.</p><p>Halifax said <a href=\"https://static.halifax.co.uk/assets/pdf/mortgages/pdf/january-2020-halifax-house-price-index.pdf\">house prices rose by 0.4% in January</a>, adding just over \u00a31,000 to the average pricetag of \u00a3240,054.

It \n for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors, requiring that 1) they are free from the company\u2019s control; 2) they are doing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business; and 3) they have an independent business in that industry.\nAs a means of complying, \n now allows drivers to get more trip information up front before accepting a rider\u2019s request, including travel time, distance, destination and estimated fare. Drivers can now reject ride requests without penalty.\nThe change gives drivers the illusion of more autonomy, but \u201cseems like a trick\u201d, said Veena Dubal, an associate professor of labor law at University of California-Hastings. If a driver sets a fare too high, they may end up waiting longer for a passenger. If they set it too low, they won\u2019t be able to cover their costs.\n\u201cThis is incentivizing a race to the bottom\u201d, Dubal said. \u201cI am skeptical this is good for workers.\u201d\nNor will it help Uber drivers to pass the three-part test at the center of AB5, Dubal said, as the core of Uber\u2019s business will still be driving. Drivers will thus fail part two, which declares a worker must be \u201cdoing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business\u201d in order to be a contractor.\nInstead, she suggested these changes may lead customers to believe drivers have more autonomy than they do, which is key ahead of the ballot measure Uber has\n in 2020 to counteract AB5.\nUber drivers have long asked for more freedom to cancel rides, but the changes are too little too late, Gregg said.\n\u201cNothing has really changed, but Uber makes it as convoluted as possible to make it seem like they have changed,\u201d he said.\nSince 21 January, Uber has been testing an additional feature in several cities that allows drivers to set their own payment rates, in an effort to prove its employees are contractors with freedom to set their own wages.\nUnder this new bidding system, Uber sets a base fare and drivers are then able to increase the rate in 10% increments, to reach up to five times the base price of the ride set by Uber. Uber then matches each rider with the driver who has set the lowest price. Drivers who have set higher fares will be matched as more rides are requested.\nIt is currently being tested only at airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento, a spokesman for the company said. He said these changes were meant to \u201cenhance drivers\u2019 control\u201d over their earnings to address AB5.\n\u201cSince AB5 has gone into effect, we\u2019ve made a number of product changes to preserve flexible work for tens of thousands of California drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now doing an initial test of additional changes which would give drivers more control over the rates they charge riders.\u201d\nUber has also introduced measures on the rider side, showing them a range of prices based on distance and time when hailing a ride rather than the set rate provided in the past. They will also be able to select \u201cfavorite\u201d drivers to be matched with again in the future.\n\u201cThis has much more to do with public perception than whether it will actually have a legal impact on AB5,\u201d Dubal said. \u201cThe intention is to create confusion among the riding public and among drivers.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises", "title": "Broadband: new warnings to end rip-off price rises", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:30:03 GMT", "summary": "<p>Under new rules, millions of users paying too much will have to be told of better deals</p><p>New rules from next Saturday will force companies offering broadband and home phone deals to tell customers what they were paying on their old contract and how much their bill is going up, in a move designed to encourage users to shop around.</p><p>It follows research by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom\" title=\"\">Ofcom</a> which found that 20m households are no longer on their provider\u2019s initial contract \u2013 and overpaying as a result.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "New rules from next Saturday will force companies offering broadband and home phone deals to tell customers what they were paying on their old contract and how much their bill is going up, in a move designed to encourage users to shop around.\nIt follows research by \n which found that 20m households are no longer on their provider\u2019s initial contract \u2013 and overpaying as a result.\nCustomers who bundle their landline and broadband together \n if they are out of contract, the media regulator warned.

The US will push aggressively against anything that blocks American companies from doing business here, and there are few things on which the two countries are more divided than climate policy.\nThe UK has ambitious plans to \n, while the US has little policy and no targets to speak of. So the government will struggle to come to an agreement without sacrificing its already fragile climate commitments. Trade deals are increasingly about \n (a very EU-ey word) of standards and regulations to allow foreign goods and services into our borders. And it won\u2019t surprise anyone to learn that alignment with the US rarely leads to stronger regulation; instead, trade agreements often act as a powerful and undemocratic tool to erode or supersede existing protections.\nThe common example is the fear of poorly checked, \n being sold in the UK. But the gulf between the US and UK on climate is even larger than on food standards. Documents from a 2018 meeting, leaked in November, set out a harsh starting position: the US will \n or include the term in any deal, which means it won\u2019t consider existing climate policies legitimate grounds for opposition to any of its demands.\nThis suggests the American negotiators will push to weaken existing low-carbon standards, or worse \u2013 given the UK has many climate targets but little actual concrete policy as yet \u2013 lock in clauses favourable to the fossil fuel industry that can\u2019t be easily overturned by domestic legislation. This would effectively head off climate policy before it can be written. A similar thing played out before negotiations when the UK was part of the EU: in the now stalled \n (TTIP), the US pushed for wording that would prevent initiatives to help renewables compete with fossil fuels. That demand is likely to be repeated, with the American fossil fuel industry keen to get fracked gas as well as \n into the UK.\nThe government\u2019s recent fracking ban could also come under pressure from US companies looking to operate here. In practically all the sectors identified by the committee on climate change as requiring decarbonisation policies \u2013 agriculture, power generation, transport \u2013 there will be a push to lock in market mechanisms, enshrine \u201ccompetition\u201d, and head off attempts at regulation.\nPerhaps most worryingly, the US has also indicated it will push for any agreement to include an \n \u2013 a controversial mechanism that gives foreign companies access to a supranational tribunal where they can sue entire countries within the bounds of the trade agreement but outside their own legal system. These have been used by companies to recoup \u201clost profits\u201d when countries try to introduce environmental legislation: for instance, the Canadian province of \n under the North American Free Trade Agreement after it banned fracking in 2011.\nWith an ISDS, a bad deal for climate would not only harm existing standards, it could also prevent climate policies being made in the future, either because they contradict the agreement or because they could open the government to trade disputes.\nClimate policy wouldn\u2019t cover a product quite as viscerally unappealing as chlorinated chicken, or an institution as beloved as the NHS, both of which have focused public anger on the usually arcane process of trade negotiation. The risk with climate is that a trade deal would involve death by a thousand cuts for regulation, with changes across the entire economy \u2013 none big enough to contest on their own.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to work this way: the EU is currently proposing a \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d that would force trading partners to comprehensively consider the climate impact of all their products and services, an example of how trade policy can be used to strengthen global climate efforts. But \n, the minister in charge of negotiations, and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, are deregulators of the highest order. Both were co-authors of the 2012 book \n, which criticised the UK for a \u201cbloated state, high taxes and excessive regulation\u201d. They maintain that the government is committed to its existing climate targets, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll actually back the protections we need in order to meet them.\n Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/equity-release-what-are-the-options-for-older-people": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/equity-release-what-are-the-options-for-older-people", "title": "Equity release: what are the options for older people?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>Taking cash out of your home is more popular than ever, but other choices could be better for you</p><p>Older people are withdrawing \u00a310m a day from their homes \u2013 adding up to \u00a33.4bn last year \u2013 and it\u2019s not just for new kitchens and dream holidays.

New research reveals a surge in the number of people turning to equity release in order to pay off debts and mortgages.\n is becoming an increasingly mainstream proposition, and rates on these deals have fallen to record lows, making them look more tempting. The lowest interest rates are now below 3%, whereas five years ago you would have done very well to get 5%.\nLower rates make a big difference to what you can end up owing. To give a very rough example, someone aged 71 who wants to release \u00a360,000 as a lump sum might, after 20 years, be looking at owing a total of \u00a3106,000 (the loan plus interest). That might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s much less than the \u00a3166,000 that someone who was 71 in 2015 would owe after 20 years.\nHowever, these are complex products, and there are downsides.\nSo if you are an older homeowner who is short of cash, should you consider taking the plunge? Or are there better alternatives out there, such as the so-called \u201c\n\u201d (Rio) mortgages that some lenders have launched?\nEquity release is a way for older people \u2013 the minimum age is usually 55, and sometimes 60 \u2013 to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Typically there are no monthly repayments. Leading providers include Aviva, Legal & General, more2life, LV= (Liverpool Victoria), Just and Canada Life. The average amount released last year was \u00a375,600, according to \n.\nBut equity release can be an expensive way to borrow. The way these schemes work means you end up paying interest on interest, so the total owed can balloon. For most, the most financially effective way of freeing up cash is to move to a smaller property or cheaper area.\nThe most common are mortgage-based products secured against your home, repaid from the sale of the property when you die or go into long-term care. These are known as lifetime mortgages and allow you to take out a loan on your property in return for a one-off lump sum or regular smaller sums.\nThese deals are becoming more flexible \u2013 a growing number include a feature called drawdown, where a pot of money is set aside for you to draw from when you need to. \nThis is popular because not everyone needs a big lump sum at the outset, and because you only pay interest on the cash you release.\nThis will vary and depend on your age, the value of your property and sometimes your health. According to the firms\u2019 website calculators, someone aged 75 with a \u00a3300,000 house could typically borrow:\n \u00a3145,500 from Just\n \u00a3145,500 from Legal & General\n \u00a3141,000 to \u00a3163,500 from more2life (depending on how healthy you are)\n \u00a3123,000 from Aviva\nAt age 85 those figures rise to \u00a3168,000 for both Just and L&G, \u00a3159,000-\u00a3163,500 for more2life, and \u00a3156,000 for Aviva.\n\u201cOver the last few years rates have fallen significantly and it is not unusual to see clients taking out products with sub-3% interest rates,\u201d says Will Hale at Key. For example, rates at more2life start at 2.67%.\nThe \n from LV= shows that 27% of customers in 2019 used equity release to clear their mortgage, loans or debts \u2013 up from 15% in 2016. Almost one in four customers (24%) used some or all the cash for home and garden improvements. Others splash out on holidays or help family and friends.\nA couple, both 71, have a \u00a3350,000 house and want to release \u00a360,000. Key looked at two scenarios for Guardian Money: releasing the cash as a lump sum or releasing an initial \u00a320,000 and withdrawing four lots of \u00a310,000 at the end of years three, five, eight and 10. These are based on an interest rate of 2.89% from more2life, available through specialist advisers.\nUnder the first scenario the amount owing \u2013 loan plus interest \u2013 would be \u00a369,000 after five years and \u00a380,000 after 10 years. After 20 years it would be \u00a3106,000.\nUnder the second scenario the amounts owed would be lower: \u00a333,000 after five years, \u00a362,000 after 10 years, and \u00a390,000 after 20 years.\nMany equity release products offer borrowers the opportunity to make interest repayments if they wish. If the couple did this, the balance outstanding would simply reflect the total sum they had borrowed on equity release, provided all monthly interest repayments had been met. At the end of 20 years, in both scenarios \u00a360,000 would be owed.\nThese are a new type of interest-only mortgage for older people. They might appeal to those put off by the idea of equity release.\nRio mortgages are effectively standard home loan deals with one big difference: the mortgage doesn\u2019t usually have a set end date and carries on until the borrower\u2019s death, or they move into a care home. Until then, the borrower continues to pay the interest each month, and the loan is ultimately repaid from the sale of their property.\nThere are now more than 70 Rio mortgage products on the market, with rates starting at 2.74% courtesy of Nationwide, according to data provider Moneyfacts.\nThe good news about Rio mortgages is that they will often work out cheaper than equity release over the longer term, according to number-crunching by financial information firm Defaqto. The bad news \u2013 apart from the fact that you must make monthly repayments \u2013 is that you have to undergo affordability tests similar to a standard mortgage, and anecdotal evidence suggests many people are failing because the tests are pretty strict.\nYou will need to show that you can afford the mortgage payments as well as all your living costs, which probably means you will need to be getting a pretty chunky pension income. For many older people that will be a tall order. Also, most Rio rates aren\u2019t fixed for life, as is the case with equity release.\nNevertheless, if you are an older borrower with a secure income, you may want to check out Rio mortgages first.\nAge UK\u2019s website, \n, has extensive information on equity release and links to advisers.

Life satisfaction steadily picked up between 2011 and 2015 as the economy recovered \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 from the deep recession that accompanied the global financial crisis and then remained steady in the second half of the 2010s.\nOne possible explanation for the drop in wellbeing is that the economy was going through a sticky patch. The economy had contracted in the second quarter of 2019 and there was an increase in the number of redundancies from 3.1 to 4.3 per 1,000 employees in the year to the third quarter. Academic studies show unemployment is an especially potent cause of unhappiness.\nAnother explanation is that by the late summer and early autumn of 2019 Britain had a serious case of the Brexit blues. It was a period during which there was a change of prime minister and parliamentary gridlock. Millions of voters \u2013 regardless of how they voted in the EU referendum \u2013 were sick of \n and wanted the subject to go away.\nEither way, calling a general election was a big gamble for Boris Johnson. It is not usually good news for governing parties when people start to feel more miserable. What\u2019s more, there was a strong argument that after calling the referendum in the first place and then making a complete horlicks of the subsequent withdrawal negotiations, the Conservatives owned Brexit.\nSo if people were fed up how come the Tories won by a landslide? In part because Johnson marketed himself as a clean break who would get Britain out of the EU. But also because Jeremy Corbyn failed to convince an uneasy country that it would be any happier under a Labour government.\nThe past decade has produced two unexpected publishing success stories. One was \n, the EL James story of how a loaded businessman satisfies his desire for kinky sex. The other was \n, an account of the other thing that turns on the rich and powerful: money.\nIf anything, Piketty\u2019s book was the greater surprise, since 800-page tomes that call for a global wealth tax do not often fly off the shelves. That, though, was back in 2013 and now the French economist is in London to publicise the English language edition of his follow-up, \n.\nThe premise of the new book is that modern capitalism is dysfunctional because it has led to much higher levels of inequality than existed 40 years ago. This has led to the rise of social tensions everywhere, but the lack of an egalitarian and universal political outlet has meant discontent with the status quo has manifested itself in rightwing nationalism.\n says it should be possible to construct a different sort of global economy \u2013 one that would redistribute the proceeds of a wealth tax through a universal capital endowment, be more inclined to restrict free movement of money rather than people, and which would have social, fiscal and environmental justice at its heart.\nAll of which sounds a tad utopian. What the book never makes clear \u2013 despite running to more than 1,000 pages \u2013 is how this kinder, gentler capitalism is going to come about.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/05/us-autonomy-mike-lynch-takeover-court": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/05/us-autonomy-mike-lynch-takeover-court", "title": "Alarm bells sound over US pursuit of Autonomy's Mike Lynch", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 07:46:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Should fallout from the takeover of a UK firm, conducted under UK rules, really end up in a US court?</p><p>Mike Lynch, in his heyday as the UK\u2019s software supremo, was a prickly character whose run-ins with City analysts were legendary.

Here\u2019s one central question: should the fallout from the takeover of a UK company, conducted under UK takeover rules, really end up in a US court?\nLynch was the founder of a UK company quoted on the London Stock Exchange. Allegations of improper accounting in the $11bn sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011 were investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office, which decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges, and Lynch has always denied any wrongdoing. Yet \n of fraud and conspiracy against Lynch relating to the deal.\nLynch \n in London on Wednesday as part of the US extradition proceedings but will fight the request under \u201cforum bar\u201d provisions, which allow a UK court to block an extradition if it deems the majority of alleged criminality took place in the UK.\nThat hearing lies ahead but, in the meantime, we are awaiting a big development: judgment in the \u00a33.8bn civil fraud trial brought against Lynch in London by Hewlett-Packard, which claims Autonomy\u2019s value was artificially inflated before the sale. The US company ended up \n.\nThe high court\u2019s verdict is critical to the wider issues. It is conceivable that Hewlett-Packard could fail to win its civil case, where the balance of probabilities is the threshold, and yet Lynch could still be sent to the US to face criminal charges with a higher burden of proof. If that were to happen, the process would look grossly unfair.\nDavid Davis, the former Brexit secretary and longstanding critic of UK-US extradition arrangements, has called the DoJ\u2019s timing \u201cextraordinarily inappropriate\u201d. Fair comment: if the roles were reversed, does anyone seriously think the UK would be able to summon a high-profile US executive in these circumstances?\nAlison Cooper exited as chief executive of FTSE 100 tobacco group Imperial Brands on Monday but her profit warnings keep coming. The group is wheezing from its big push into so-called next-generation products and group earnings will be slightly lower this year, it says. The share price, which was \u00a340 in 2016, is now \u00a318.22.\nImperial is not unique in over-promising and under-delivering on the next-gen front. The whole industry has failed to live up to its hype, especially now that the US health authorities have reacted to a vaping \u201cepidemic\u201d among children by banning some of the flavoured capsules. But Imperial\u2019s flop seem the worst of the lot.\nThe company was late to arrive in the e-cigarette market and then, having bought the Blu brand in 2015, splashed cash for little reward. The City diagnoses \u201cexecution\u201d mistakes \u2013 poor products and ineffective marketing \u2013 which explains why the board joined shareholders in \n.

When it happens, it will be time to remember Cooper once again: in her nine years in charge, the share price returned to where it started but she was paid an astonishing \u00a330m.\nThe role of chief strategy and transformation director at Marks & Spencer may sound like two jobs in one, but it will be a four-day-a-week gig for Katie Bickerstaffe, who has been summoned from the retailer\u2019s non-executive bench.\nThis corporate readiness to accept that senior jobs do not have to consume every waking hour should be applauded. The workaholic tendency is a curse on productivity and, since M&S employs a large number of part-time workers, it\u2019s helpful to send a message about a open approach to appointment.

I received it alongside Joan Collins, who was being made a Dame, and at the end of the day, I looked at my mum, dad and sister, and was like: \u201cWell look at that, Jamal is with Dame Joan Collins!\u201d It was so surreal.\nLooking back on when I was starting out, my parents definitely struggled with the fact that I wasn\u2019t going to uni, instead choosing to focus on making my music video platform, SB.TV, work. I was doing a BTec in media and moving image, but I really wanted to be out filming for SB.TV \u2013 the more I did, the more fire I had to continue. In the end, I made a deal with my parents: if I completed my diploma, they\u2019d let me concentrate on my passion. They agreed, so I put my head down and got it done. Today, SB.TV is a full-blown entertainment company, but when I said I was getting into YouTube to start it, the response was mainly: \u201cUh, right \u2026\u201d as it had only been around for a year when I signed up in 2006. Even when it started to become more successful there was still a feeling among some people that it wasn\u2019t going to work out and that I needed to get a \u201cproper job\u201d.\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s great about apprenticeships nowadays. I would have been able to take one within the music industry, alongside spending time at college learning the theory. But now there are way more options than there were back then. Deciding not to go to uni put me up against a lot of obstacles, and I doubt I would have experienced those today as apprenticeships can lead to the equivalent of a degree certificate.\nSaying that, I understand it can be hard for people \u2013 especially parents \u2013 to get their heads round. There\u2019s still a lot of stigma attached to apprenticeships, for instance there\u2019s an assumption that you can only do apprenticeships in trades like plumbing and construction, and that really needs to be reversed. My advice to parents would be to talk to your kid and work with them to figure out how they can achieve their dreams. Ask them questions, find out what inspires them, and together you can find a balance that will suit both sides. I look back and really wish I had been more open with my parents during my teens, as now I know they would have been so helpful in so many situations. University isn\u2019t the only option, so don\u2019t force your kid down that path when they could reach their full potential another way.\nAnd to any young person who doesn\u2019t think the traditional academic route is for them, take your time and research. Soak up the different cultures around you, learn what makes you tick \u2013 an apprenticeship could be the ideal route. You can work in fashion, music, law ... there are so many avenues to explore. Try one, you won\u2019t be tied down, and you never know, you might just love it.\nSo what\u2019s it actually like to embark on an apprenticeship? Lauren Franklin talks to an apprentice and his employer\nI had a place at university, but at the last minute I did a cost-benefit analysis, and the numbers didn\u2019t make sense. I knew I wanted a degree in technology, and when I saw the Accenture programme it was exactly what I needed. I get a bachelor\u2019s degree at the end of it, but I\u2019ll have no student debt and three years of great work experience.\nThere are so many! There\u2019s a wide variety of opportunities. I started in capital markets, working with investment banks, then I worked in a high street bank in Leeds, followed by a government department to help prepare for Brexit, and then an Australian insurance company. It\u2019s been so diverse, and there\u2019s a lot of room to manoeuvre.\nThere\u2019s a big support network available. We have an HR adviser, a career counsellor, an academic adviser and apprenticeship ambassadors like Neha who are there to help us with anything and everything. When you\u2019re ready for responsibility they\u2019ll give it to you. You\u2019re not just tucked away in the corner \u2013 you\u2019re allowed to flourish.\nI\u2019m from a very traditional Asian household, so you\u2019re either a lawyer, a doctor or an engineer! When I told my mum, she was a little annoyed, but accepted it. Now she\u2019s a big advocate of apprenticeships \u2013 she\u2019s telling all her friends. The older generation sometimes don\u2019t understand because the more traditional image is apprenticeships being for trades, however, there are hundreds, ranging from journalist to a nuclear missile engineer. You can even become a solicitor.\nI\u2019ve come on leaps and bounds. Confidence-wise, I never thought I\u2019d be able to serve in leadership or in strategic roles, and getting that boost helped me get rid of imposter syndrome. When you start out you have that feeling of: \u201cDo I really belong here?\u201d but everyone is so supportive and is always there to help.\nEach [apprentice] has their own career counsellor who will be there for them throughout their career here. I make sure the roles they take match with the degree course they\u2019re on, plus that they are getting the right balance with attending uni once a week. They get the support and are given a lot of space and trust to go and work.\nWith an apprenticeship, your child can establish themselves at a company while, in some cases, getting a degree. They will grow as an individual as they work in teams. And at Accenture, we\u2019ll provide them with pastoral support to help them along.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/fire-up-your-future/2020/jan/23/being-successful-is-about-skills-why-apprenticeships-are-taking-off-as-a-career-path": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fire-up-your-future/2020/jan/23/being-successful-is-about-skills-why-apprenticeships-are-taking-off-as-a-career-path", "title": "\u2018Being successful is about skills\u2019: why apprenticeships are taking off as a career path", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:35:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>From marketing to software development, apprenticeships are opening up in a huge variety of new sectors.

The UK aviation sector this week committed to \n by 2050, wiping out its carbon emissions despite taking more than 100 million extra passengers into the air each year.\nAt a celebratory event in London, the bosses of airports, airlines and aircraft manufacturers queued to scrawl their signatures on a giant Net Zero pledge card from the Sustainable Aviation [SA] campaign.\nGreenpeace described it as greenwash. But aviation figures insist the ambition is genuine. John Holland-Kaye, the Heathrow airport chief executive, says: \u201cI imagine it\u2019s like it is for alcoholics. The first step is to admit we have a problem \u2013 and then do something about it. I\u2019m not sure what the 10 points on the AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] programme are, but you can find the equivalent in the SA roadmap.\u201d\nThe steps certainly involve a leap of faith, in future fuels and aircraft technology, and human capacity to endlessly offset emissions. Just how does a growing industry plan to reduce its annual footprint from just over 36m tonnes of CO2 to net zero in three decades\u2019 time?\nAircraft such as Boeing\u2019s 787 or Airbus\u2019s A350 already emit significantly less than the older jets they are replacing, through lighter materials and more efficient engines. Sustainable Aviation anticipates that emissions will drop by about 30% on routes operated by Boeing 747 jumbos as they are phased out within a decade. The next iteration of the manufacturers\u2019 short-haul workhorses are supposed to be 10%-15% more efficient \u2013 demonstrated with the A320neo superseding A320s, although the \n of the grounded Boeing 737 Max has \n.\nAltogether different types of propulsion will be in operation by the 2030s, manufacturers believe. But while new electric planes could revolutionise regional flights, and hybrid-electric could manage short-haul flying, their contribution to cutting UK emissions \u2013 about 65% of which hail from flights of more than 1,000 miles \u2013 will be comparatively minor by 2050, SA admits.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be electrifying a London-Singapore A380 for a long time, if ever,\u201d says Paul Stein, chief technology officer of aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce. \u201cBut sustainable fuels can work on the engines we have today, and the concept has been proved.\u201d\nCreating the necessary volume is the tricky bit. Hopes have been pinned on new schemes, such as the new \n from household waste. Stein says Rolls-Royce has been exploring whether a small modular nuclear reactor could be used in a synthetic fuel plant, making hydrocarbons in a way that would reduce CO2 to balance the emissions produced in flight.\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re in analysis phase \u2013 understanding the economics \u2026 But what we\u2019re going to see over the next 10 to 20 years is a lot of innovation and energy directed at creating sustainable aviation fuel.\u201d\nProgress in coordinating European airspace and air traffic control has been slow. But with better use of airspace, and coordinated flight paths, planes could be guided more efficiently from take-off to landing. The UK is in the midst of redesigning its airspace to help create better paths. More efficient operations, such as eliminating stacking, would help aircraft carry and burn less fuel.\nEnvironmental groups question the adequacy of offsetting \u2013 but the roadmap relies on it to account for more than a third of aviation\u2019s projected emissions. Jonathan Counsell, head of sustainability at British Airways\u2019 owner IAG, says: \u201cWe think that we can get to net zero without it \u2013 but not by 2050. This is a transitional measure.\u201d The scepticism about offsetting means, Counsell admits, that any schemes have to be high-quality, independently verified and end in actual, additional carbon removal. For now, offsetting means reforestation or restoration of peatland bogs that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere; later, potentially, investment in new carbon capture and storage technologies.\nIn an industry run by accountants, some jiggery-pokery was perhaps inevitable: emissions are \u201csaved\u201d as the 70% rise in passengers by 2050 is, in fact, slightly lower than the Department of Transport\u2019s growth forecast growth.\n\u201cWe will have to pay more to fly,\u201d says Holland-Kaye. Sustainable fuels are more expensive, and the carbon price is expected to rise tenfold, he says. The price of all the offsetting that the industry will rely on will be passed on to consumers through higher fares, constraining demand.\nSo can this work? The industry urgently wants to present an alternative vision to the growing backlash against flying. Stein says: \u201cFlying connects the world \u2013 it is a force for good in transporting people and goods, making sure our cultures have great levels of understanding.\u201d\nAs an engineer, he says, he is optimistic that emissions can be brought down sooner than the roadmap pledge: \u201cWe have the engineering tools to do it; we need the will, and government help.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/06/will-hs2-really-benefit-the-north": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/06/will-hs2-really-benefit-the-north", "title": "Will HS2 really benefit the north?", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 03:00:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the government prepares to give the green light to a new high-speed rail line between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, Helen Pidd looks at the dire state of transport links in the north of England.

This April the final phase of the tax changes on buy-to-let income comes into force, and the good news is that landlords are giving up on the game.\nHMRC data obtained by accountants Moore this week show that the number of buy-to-let landlords with multiple properties fell in 2017-18 to 157,000 from 159,000 the year before. The fall may be slight, but it\u2019s important, as it marks the first decline since the financial crisis.\nThe figures are for the latest period for which figures are available \u2013 and when the cuts to tax relief were only just beginning to bite. Since 2017-18, they have accelerated, making it almost certain that more and more landlords have withdrawn from the market.\nThe tax attack on buy-to-let has been quite remarkable, all the more so considering it was \n.\nTake the example of a landlord with a buy-to-let who is picking up \u00a3950 a month in rent, but paying a mortgage of \u00a3600 a month.\nPrior to April 2017, 100% of the mortgage interest was tax deductible. It\u2019s why buy-to-let landlords always took out interest-only mortgages, while first-time buyers were forced to take out more expensive repayment mortgages. The same first-time buyers could, of course, not deduct any interest against tax. It meant that, at the point of purchase, the buy-to-let merchants had a ludicrous tax advantage over people buying a home to live in themselves.\nSince April 2017 the ability to deduct interest against tax has been cut every year, and from April 2020 it finally disappears. For our landlord with the \u00a3950 a month rental income, his after-tax profit in 2017 would have been \u00a32,520. From this April it will be \u00a31,080.\nThat leaves very little for repairs and maintenance and, if the tenant leaves and there is just one month\u2019s \u201cvoid\u201d in rental income, then the profit disappears altogether.\nBut it\u2019s not just interest deductibility that has changed. Landlords have, since 2016, been required to pay 3% additional stamp duty on purchases. On a \u00a3300,000 buy, the landlord now pays \u00a314,000 stamp duty, the normal buyer \u00a35,000.\nThen there\u2019s wear-and-tear allowances. Until 2016 landlords could routinely deduct 10% of net rent from their profits to cover wear and tear, whether they did anything on not. Now they can only claim tax relief when they actually purchase something for their rental property.\nCharging \n to tenants has also been banned, plus there\u2019s a new \n. No-fault \n are also on the way out.\nYou could almost shed a tear for landlords, the vast majority of whom are perfectly decent property managers and owners. The minority who are \u201crogue\u201d landlords are more than matched by the minority of rogue tenants. But the landlords who wail \u201cIt\u2019s my pension\u201d should show humility; their pension is just a transfer from young adults, many of whom are having to give across half their income to the landlord. What about their pension? What about their chances of ever getting on the property ladder?\nLandlords who bought during the boom years are sitting on large capital gains, the product of monetary policy, land scarcity and population growth, and virtually nothing to do with their own endeavours. The \u201cproblem\u201d I hear from some landlords is that they want to sell up, but will be hit with a large CGT bill. What a distressing situation to be in. Large unearned profits, on which they may have to pay some tax.\nWhat the buy-to-let episode shows is that policy matters. The explosion in buy-to-let was not a \u201cnatural\u201d phenomenon \u2013 it was a product of legal changes in the 1990s (the assured shorthold tenancy) married to a tax regime that favoured landlords. The result was entirely predictable; home ownership began to fall, not just among the young but increasingly among middle-aged people as well. \n wealth shifted into fewer and fewer hands.\nSince the change in buy-to-let taxation, the result has also been entirely predictable; the fall in home ownership has stabilised, and may be on the turn. There is a tendency to view the property market in fatalistic terms; there\u2019s nothing we can do about prices, building, demand and so on. But we can.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/bank-couple-lose-43000-but-cant-get-a-refund": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/bank-couple-lose-43000-but-cant-get-a-refund", "title": "Bank fraud: couple lose \u00a343,000 but can't get a refund", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 08:00:31 GMT", "summary": "<p>Two retirees were conned out of their savings, but the banks say they were negligent</p><p>It started with a phone call to their home landline \u2013 and ended with a police stakeout and panic alarm being fitted in their Cambridgeshire home.

Victims duped into sending money to an account operated by criminals were to be refunded, where they had been the victim of a complex fraud \u2013 a so-called no-blame scenario.\nAt the time the code was hailed as a breakthrough as before then the banks were routinely blaming fraud victims, and turning down claims for refunds on the basis that people had been grossly negligent.\nHowever, a growing number of fraud victims have contacted Guardian Money in recent months to say that nothing has changed, and that the banks are ignoring the code.\nThe most recent are George and Pamela Ross (not their real names), who live near Cambridge. \nBack in November, the Rosses took a call on their home landline from someone claiming to be a bank fraud investigator, who told them that their life savings were at risk of being stolen.\nThe couple were told staff could only discuss the details with them if they called their bank\u2019s fraud team by phoning the number on the back of their bank cards.\nBut the scammers were able to keep the line open during this process, using fake dialling tones, phones ringing in series, and even phone transfers, so that the elderly couple believed they had reached call centres at Halifax and Santander.\nThey were told that the banks\u2019 own employees were under investigation, and bosses needed their help to catch them.\nDuring the following 24 hours, the couple were \u201cgroomed\u201d to help take down a supposed network of corrupt employees working within Halifax and Santander banks, says their daughter Sam.\nThey were instructed not to discuss the matter with family or anyone else, and in particular the staff in the banks in question. The fraudsters kept in close contact with them over the phone \u2013 even while they attended a hospital appointment, she says.\n\u201cThe fraudsters were able to coerce my 75-year-old mother to visit the Cambridge branch of Halifax where she was instructed to make two transfers of \u00a319,000 to what later turned out to be accounts at Lloyds and Barclays,\u201d Sam says.\n\u201cShe believed these accounts were safe accounts set up by the investigators. My father was similarly coerced to withdraw \u00a35,000 cash from a local Santander branch, and to hand it over to a courier for \u2018fingerprint analysis\u2019. They were both warned on approaching each bank that staff would question them in detail about scams. They were instructed to ignore this, although ironically they were not questioned in any sort of detail at all. This was in spite of the fact that these payments were completely out of keeping with their normal payments history.\u201d\nOnly when she happened to call her parents, who were in a highly distressed state, did the scam emerge. When Sam realised what was happening, the police were called, and to their credit, she says, they took the matter seriously.\n\u201cThe fraudsters had sent a courier to pick up the \u00a35,000 in cash, and were trying to persuade my father to make a second withdrawal. The police hoped to catch them at it, and my father was instructed to play along. A second withdrawal was set to be picked up at their house. A parcel of marked bank notes was handed over and the village was flooded with plain clothes officers.\n\u201cHowever, no arrest was made. My brother turned up at my parents\u2019 house by chance and was grabbed by the police. They then swooped on another innocent person, at which point the fraudsters must have realised the game was up. Their phone calls stopped abruptly, and they got away. My parents were left fearing there could be reprisals, meaning a panic alarm had to be installed in their home,\u201d says Sam.\nShe says the police have confirmed this was a particularly sophisticated scam. She has asked Halifax and Santander to refund the money, but both have refused.\nHowever, this case raises difficult questions. To what extent can the banks be liable in situations such as this? Despite the police\u2019s rare involvement in a bank fraud case, both Halifax and Santander argued that the couple were to blame.\nThis week Commander Karen Baxter, who leads the City of London police\u2019s economic crime unit, told Radio 4 that this \u201cdespicable\u201d crime, which sees victims skilfully \u201cgroomed\u201d, has jumped recently. In January, police arrested 44 people suspected of this crime recovering a huge quantity of cash, she said.\nOne of the problems that fraud victims have encountered is that the code states that only \u201cno-blame\u201d customers will be refunded.

Southwark council owns the freehold to the estate of 40 flats, 29 of which are owned by leaseholders.\nSince owning the property, the 56-year-old has been on the receiving end of \u201ceye-watering\u201d bills for maintenance to the building.\nShe says her two-bedroom flat originally lacked adequate heating. In 2014, after a series of surveys and consultations with leaseholders, the council installed a communal heating and hot water system at a cost of close to \u00a31m, saying it would last 25 years. Each flat was billed \u00a324,486. But Baharier claims that installing an individual heating system in each flat would have cost just \u00a34,000 per property.\n\u201cThey installed the communal system which included a hot water tank in my living room, plus three radiators.\u201d She decided to challenge the cost, as under the terms of her lease, she said she only had to pay for repairs, not improvements.\nBaharier took her case to the first tier tribunal which ruled that she didn\u2019t have to pay the money.\nSouthwark council appealed, and the upper tribunal ruled in its favour saying: \u201cIt is unrealistic to suggest that the parties entering into the lease intended the building to remain unchanged throughout the term.\u201d Baharier was required to pay the money, plus court fees and interest, bringing the total to about \u00a332,000. She says the new heating system regularly breaks down with leaseholders footing the bill, which the council denies.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid for more than 50 repairs in the past year. The council doesn\u2019t seem to know anyone who can fix the heating. The pipes and tanks have cracked and are leaking. I don\u2019t have any control over the temperature of my flat and my hot water tank isn\u2019t sufficiently insulated,\u201d she says.\nMajor works bills from Southwark council continued to arrive on the doormats of Baharier and the other leaseholders. These included an \u00a38,000 bill per flat for internal decoration, which was later reduced to \u00a32,000. \u201cThe council originally tried to charge us \u00a38,000 each for internal decoration which involved painting corridors and the front door to each flat. We are being ripped off. It took the workman two hours to paint my door,\u201d she says.\nSouthwark council said the \u00a38,000 bill was an \u201cestimate\u201d and included electrical work that didn\u2019t go ahead. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 requires freeholders to consult leaseholders if major works will result in a bill of \u00a3250 or more per property. Leaseholders can nominate alternative contractors to carry out the works and the freeholder is obliged to obtain an estimate. But the rules are different if the freeholder is a local authority; leaseholders can make \u201cobservations\u201d but the authority has no obligation to act on them.\nKieron Williams, cabinet member for housing management at Southwark council, said: \u201cWe have a duty to keep all our homes in good condition. Leaseholders are then legally responsible for their share of the cost of maintaining their block or estate. Unfortunately some work is expensive so the bills can be large.\u201d\nSebastian O\u2019Kelly of the \n says he gets three or four queries a week from leaseholders facing huge bills for major works, with most bills in the region of \u00a315,000 to \u00a325,000.\n\u201cThe problem is that councils do not have reserve funds, so huge bills come out of the blue. These can be devastating for right-to-buy purchasers or young first-timers, who have bought a council property because it is relatively cheap,\u201d he says, \u201cThe bills are staggeringly high, the works are often pretty shoddy and there seems to be minimal cost control.\u201d\nO\u2019Kelly\u2019s advice for those who don\u2019t think they are getting value for money is to pay the bill, and fight it later. \u201cThis means you can argue over the quality of the works or the cost without danger of being hit with legal costs if you fail,\u201d he says.\nThe Guardian reported in May that \n in Peckham, also owned by Southwark council, had received bills of \u00a3146,000 for regeneration of the whole estate.\nFor leaseholders struggling to pay the amount \u2013 which is more than five times the average UK salary \u2013 the council offered an interest-free loan over 72 months, or to buy back the property.\nBack in 2016, we reported on how \n had each received a \u00a350,000 bill from Oxford city council for works to their block. But a tribunal ruled that the 54 leaseholders were not obliged to pay for the improvements, only repairs, and the bill was reduced to less than \u00a34,000 per flat.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/should-i-buy-a-manual-petrol-car-or-automatic-hybrid": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/08/should-i-buy-a-manual-petrol-car-or-automatic-hybrid", "title": "Should I buy a manual petrol car or a automatic hybrid?", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 07:00:30 GMT", "summary": "<p>My children are likely to learn to drive on it \u2013 and I\u2019m wondering if the era of geared cars is over</p><p><strong>Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it\u2019s up to you to help him or her out \u2013 a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday\u2019s paper.</strong></p><p>I\u2019d like to buy a hybrid car but they\u2019re nearly all automatics.

By the end of 2021, its orbit will have an inclination of 17\u00b0 \u2013 high enough to take images of the sun\u2019s extremities \u2013 and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33\u00b0.\nComputational models and magnetic field measurements suggest that the sun\u2019s poles could be dominated by huge coronal holes \u2013 areas of the surface that are less dense than their surroundings and will show up as ominous dark pools.\n\u201cThese coronal holes are enormous at the poles. We\u2019ll be able to peer over the edges \u2026 and see how it grows and shrinks with solar activity\u201d, said Nicola Fox, director of Nasa\u2019s heliophysics division. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve never been able to do before.\u201d\nStriking geometric features are also a possibility, according to McCaughrean. The first images of Jupiter\u2019s north pole surprised astronomers with an \n of storms twirling like cogs around a central vortex, while Saturn\u2019s north pole features a \n.\nThe $1.3bn mission will run parallel to \n, launched 18 months ago, which has flown closer to the sun than any spacecraft, and the \n, which has acquired the highest resolution images of the solar surface since it began observations in December. \nAt just 3.83 million miles from the solar surface \u2013 technically inside the sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 Parker will be seven times closer to the Sun than Solar Orbiter. But, McCaughrean points out, Parker will not be taking any direct images because if it looked at the sun, it would melt. From its slightly less scorching vantage point, Solar Orbiter will be able to make long-range observations of surface features such as sun spots as well as detecting the solar wind streaming past.\n\u201cWe always wanted to make this seeing and feeling connection. The stuff that you can see at the surface you can feel going past a few days later\u201d, said McCaughrean. \u201cParker is out there going \u2018Ooh, I\u2019m feeling stuff but I\u2019ve got no idea where it came from\u2019.\u201d\nSolar Orbiter\u2019s camera and other instruments are housed behind a heat shield, peering out through shuttered peepholes that close whenever the probe\u2019s interior gets too hot. The titanium shield is coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones, something Esa concluded was uniquely well-suited to keeping the craft at a stable temperature throughout the mission.\nThe probe\u2019s orbit, which at times will move almost in synch with the sun\u2019s own rotation, will allow it to track sun spots on the solar surface as they appear and vanish, and will investigate the origins of the solar wind as it streams off the sun.\nThe mission will also use helioseismology \u2013 measurements of small and large scale oscillations at the sun\u2019s surface \u2013 to try and unravel the sun\u2019s internal structure. The sun\u2019s acoustic \u201cringing\u201d can also reveal sun spots bubbling up from the interior days before they appear as darkened patches on the surface.\nSolar Orbiter is scheduled to begin making science measurements in May, with full operations starting in November 2021, when the probe\u2019s telescopes switch on.\n\u201cIt will capture the imagination like science fiction does and inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers,\u201d said Yannis Zouganelis, Esa\u2019s deputy project scientist for Solar Orbiter.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/07/cosmic-ray-research-station-mount-aragats-photo-essay": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/07/cosmic-ray-research-station-mount-aragats-photo-essay", "title": "'We're above civilisation': life in a cosmic ray station \u2013 photo essay", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 07:27:54 GMT", "summary": "<p>Cut off during winter, a former Soviet weapons research facility high up on Mount Aragats, Armenia is now part of a network of sites around the world studying the mysterious particles</p><p>The cosmic ray research station on Mount Aragats sits at an altitude of 3,200 metres.

These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed\nfor corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.\nThe particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.\nHigh-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth\u2019s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.\nThe Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.\nAs well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes\nin radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.\nSoviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.\nDotted around the centre, \u201cscintillators\u201d record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.\nAlthough Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.\nJabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is \u201cwhen the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month\u201d. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: \u201cWe\u2019re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there\u2019s nothing to disturb them.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2020/feb/06/can-we-predict-the-weather-in-space": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2020/feb/06/can-we-predict-the-weather-in-space", "title": "What's the weather like in space?

Five minutes later, they vanished.\nLater that night, bright aurora lit the Earth\u2019s sky as far south as Havana and Honolulu. Around the world, telegraph communications failed, some of them bursting into flames.\nCarrington had observed a billion tonnes of plasma being lifted off the sun\u2019s surface and accelerated into space at more than 1,300 times the speed of sound. While most such events miss the Earth, this was a direct hit. The so called \u201cCarrington Event\u201d created the largest geomagnetic storm in recorded history.\nSolar activity of this magnitude is, thankfully, rare. Analysis of ice core samples suggest the storm of 1859 may have been the fiercest in 500 years.\nBut what if it were to happen again?\nThe impact on today\u2019s far more technology dependent society could be more serious. That\u2019s why governments around the world are paying increasing attention to \u201cspace weather\u201d.\nNot to be confused with weather on Earth, space weather is concerned with the environmental conditions in near-Earth space caused by magnetic fields, radiation and matter ejected from the sun.\nLast month, the US House science, space and technology committee approved a bill to prioritise investment in space weather forecasting. While the UK government has also developed a detailed strategy to prepare for severe space weather.\nBut there is a lot we don\u2019t yet know. It\u2019s difficult to predict space weather events with accuracy \u2013 and with more than 160 years of technological advancement since the Carrington Event, there\u2019s no way to know what the impact on modern society would be.\nTo help answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at the source of space weather: the sun.\nIn 2018, Nasa launched the Parker Solar Probe, venturing closer than any previous mission to study the sun\u2019s atmosphere or corona.\nOn 9 February the \n will launch its own mission, the Solar Orbiter, to further expand our knowledge of the sun and space weather. It will use the gravity of Venus to help get into orbit around the sun. The Solar Orbiter will not get as close as Nasa\u2019s probe but will be able to look directly at the sun.\nOf the many innovations onboard the Solar Orbiter, one of the most interesting is the heat shield. Its outermost layer will be lined with a material called \u201csolar black\u201d \u2013 a type of black calcium phosphate processed from burnt bone charcoal.\nBurnt char bone has an ancient legacy. Our prehistoric ancestors would use it, along with wooden charcoal, as a black pigment. The survival of some cave paintings after thousands of years is a testament to the material\u2019s endurance.\nRemote-sensing instruments onboard the Solar Orbiter will observe the sun through tiny sliding doors in the shield, while other instruments will measure the conditions around the spacecraft. Together, they will allow the craft to investigate the three most common types of solar activity that drive space weather:\nSolar flares are sudden flashes of increased brightness but most of their energy is invisible to the naked eye, consisting of intense bursts of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.\nIf directed at the earth, solar flares disrupt radio communications. The X-rays can also heat the outer atmosphere, causing low-orbiting satellites to lose altitude.\nSolar flares are a particular concern for human missions to the moon, Mars or beyond. For example, if Apollo 17 had launched just a few months earlier, it may have encountered the solar storm of August 1972, potentially exposing the three astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation.\nScientists have a good idea of how solar flares get their energy and we know that they occur near sunspots. But the underlying mechanisms are not well understood and current methods of flare prediction are limited. There is currently no way of knowing when any given region of the sun will produce a flare.\nMuch like a giant particle accelerator, the sun sometimes shoots off storms of high energy protons and electrons into space.\nTravelling at close to the speed of light, these solar energetic particles can reach the Earth within an hour, penetrating the protective layers of our magnetic field and sometimes even reaching the surface.\nIf they were to strike the Earth, electronics onboard planes would be damaged and air travellers would be exposed to increased doses of radiation.\nPerhaps the most concerning element of solar activity, coronal mass ejections are eruptions on the surface of the sun that cause large parts of the corona to blast away.\nThey are slower than solar flares or energetic particles, taking between one and four days to reach Earth. But when they do, they create a geomagnetic storm which, much like a spring, compresses one side of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere while extending the other. When the spring adjusts, this \u201ctension\u201d is directed back into the upper atmosphere.\nCoronal mass ejections can produce mass power outages and failure of telecommunication services, including GPS. The insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London estimates that in a worst-case scenario, it could leave 20 to 40 million people in the north-eastern US without power, perhaps for years.\nEach of these phenomena can occur in isolation or in combination. On that morning in 1859, Carrington observed all three: a perfect solar storm.\nWhat are the chances it could happen again? The estimates vary. Some reports have suggested the likelihood may be as high as 12% in the next decade. However, more recent studies have put forward a more conservative estimate of between 0.46% and 1.88%.\nIn the grand scheme of global risks, weather in space may be considered less of a threat to our safety than the weather on Earth. Nonetheless, the importance of Esa\u2019s Solar Orbiter is not to be underestimated. It will answer important questions that will help us not only to prepare for severe space weather but also better understand the sun and its impact on our lives.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds", "title": "Scientists in Israel grow date plants from 2,000-year-old seeds", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:00:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>Seeds found in Judean desert are male and female, leading to hopes of producing dates</p><p>A handful of date seeds from fruit that ripened around the time of Jesus have been successfully planted and grown in southern Israel, researchers have revealed.</p><p>The seeds, dubbed Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith and Hannah, were among many others discovered at archaeological sites in the Judean desert.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/05/scientists-in-israel-grow-date-plants-from-2000-year-old-seeds\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "A handful of date seeds from fruit that ripened around the time of Jesus have been successfully planted and grown in southern \n, researchers have revealed.\nThe seeds, dubbed Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith and Hannah, were among many others discovered at archaeological sites in the Judean desert.\nIt is not the first time the team have managed to grow ancient seeds: \n that they had germinated a 1,900-year-old Judean date palm seed from Masada \u2013 an ancient site extended by Herod the Great in the first century BC that looks out over the Dead Sea. That plant, a male, was named Methuselah after the oldest character in the Bible.\nBut the new study goes further \u2013 not only involving more seeds, but shedding light on the way Judean farmers may have cultivated the famous plants.\nAnd with the newly germinated seeds including females, the discovery could bear further fruit: the team say they hope to apply Methuselah\u2019s pollen to Hannah \u2013 which is expected to produce a flower within the next two years \u2013 with the goal of producing dates.\nBut it may not quite be a resurrection.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be the typical Judean date, because dates that were grown at that time \u2013 just like dates that are grown today \u2013 are not grown from seeds that somebody puts in the earth,\u201d said Dr Sarah Sallon, director of the Louis Borick Natural Medicine Research Centre at the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem. \u201cThey are grown from clones from very high-producing females.\u201d\nDate palms are thought to have first been cultivated in Arabia and Mesopotamia (now Iraq) more than 6,000 years ago and were once widespread in ancient Judea, a region of the Levant. As well as being an important item of food, said Sallon, they were used to treat various medical conditions, including depression and poor memory. \u201cDates were an enormous export from Judea and they were famous,\u201d she said.\nWriters from Pliny the Elder to Herodotus raved about the qualities of Judean dates, including their long shelf-life, which allowed them to be transported far and wide. \u201cHerod even used to present them to the emperor in Rome every year,\u201d said Sallon.\nBut the plants suffered under centuries of unrest; by the 19th century the plantations had disappeared.\n, Sallon and colleagues report how they planted 32 Judean date palm seeds retrieved from a variety of archaeological sites across the Judean desert. These include Masada and caves at Qumran \u2013 shelters best known for concealing the Dead Sea scrolls but which were also used by refugees in ancient times.\n\u201cI spent hours and hours in the archaeology department picking through the best seeds,\u201d said Sallon. \u201cA lot of them had holes in where insects had bored through or [they had] fallen apart, but some were really pristine and I picked the very best ones.\u201d\nSix of the seeds sprouted. The team radiocarbon-dated fragments of the shells left after germination to reveal that Hannah and Adam date to somewhere between the first and fourth centuries BC. Judith and Boaz were dated to a 200-year period from the mid-second century BC, and Uriel and Jonah were dated to somewhere between the first and second centuries AD.\n\u201cI\u2019m Jewish, so I gave them Jewish names,\u201d said Sallon, adding that, before the sex of the plants was known from genetic analysis, Adam was named Eve. \nWhile some seeds took just weeks to sprout, others took half a year. \u201cWe were beginning to despair and then suddenly they came up,\u201d she said.\nThe team found that ancient date seeds are larger than those of both modern cultivated date palms and wild plants. \u201cToday\u2019s seeds are still about 30% smaller than what they grew in Judea 2,000 years ago,\u201d said Sallon. \nGenetic analysis revealed that the older the ancient seeds were, the more \u201ceastern\u201d their genetic makeup appeared to be: Adam and Methuselah are closest to present-day varieties from the Gulf.\nThat, said Sallon, may reflect the type of trees that naturally grew in Judea at the time, or they may have been brought up the Red Sea from Arabia \u2013 an ancient trading route.\nHannah and Judith are closer to modern Iraqi varieties \u2013 something Sallon said may be linked to the return of Jews from exile in Babylon in the late sixth century BC, many of whom had worked on Babylonian date plantations and may have brought plants back with them.\nMeanwhile, Uriel, Boaz and Jonah had a high genetic contribution from varieties west of Egypt and were most genetically similar to modern varieties from Morocco. \u201cThe Roman occupation [of Judea] was from the first century and it is possible that at that time they were bringing date varieties in from north Africa,\u201d said Sallon.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/jackass-penguin-call-shares-traits-of-human-speech-scientists-say": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/jackass-penguin-call-shares-traits-of-human-speech-scientists-say", "title": "Jackass penguin call shares traits of human speech, scientists say", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:01:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Researchers analysed 590 recordings taken in Italian zoos of birds\u2019 distinctive sound </p><p>The call of the jackass penguin, a wheezing bray that sounds like a donkey in distress, follows some of the same linguistic laws found in human languages, scientists have found.</p><p>Researchers say that, just like in our own speech, more frequently used sounds within the call tend to be shorter, while the longer the call, the shorter the sounds within it.

It is the first time this pattern has been shown outside primates.\n\u201cWe can probably find many other species that conform to these laws because this is probably a general principle, rather than something related to human language specifically,\u201d said Dr Livio Favaro, a co-author of the research now at the University of Turin.\nProf Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton, who was not involved in the work but has previously conducted similar research in non-human primates, said the new study adds weight to the idea that animals tend to convey information in the most efficient way. Such an approach is known as \u201ccompression\u201d and is also seen in systems such as morse code where the most commonly used letters have the simplest and shortest sounds \u2013 either a dot or a dash.\n\u201cIf you have compression in the communication system it is more efficient,\u201d said Semple. \u201cSo it is the sort of thing that evolution will have acted on because animals that communicate efficiently are expending less energy.\u201d\n, Favaro and colleagues describe how they analysed 590 vocalisations recorded from 28 adult African penguins \u2013 also known as jackass penguins because of their distinctive sound \u2013 that live in Italian zoos.\nThese vocalisations were so-called \u201cecstatic display songs\u201d \u2013 calls, typically uttered by males, that communicate an individual\u2019s identity, tell rivals that territory is taken, and help the birds bag a mate.\nThese songs are made up of sequences of three distinctive types of sound \u2013 or syllables. \nThe team say the findings suggests the penguins\u2019 songs follow two laws seen across a wide range of human languages as well as some, but not all, non-human primates \u2013 Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law.\nThe former states that the more often a sound is used the shorter it is \u2013 in English, for example, the most common words include \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cto\u201d and \u201cof\u201d \u2013 while the latter says that the longer a unit of language the shorter the components within it: for example cumbersome words tend to contain shorter syllables than simple ones. \n\u201cOne-syllable words can be very long, like \u2018strength\u2019, but many-syllable words tend to have short syllables, like \u2018pa-ra-me-ter-ise\u2019,\u201d said Prof Chris Kello, an expert in modelling language patterns at the University of California, Merced who was not involved in the latest research.\nWhile the new study has limitations \u2013 including that it only looked at one form of vocalisation among the penguins \u2013 Favaro said the study shows the linguistic laws are not about language per se, as they are not linked to semantics or syntax, but are rooted more in a fundamental principle of sharing information efficiently. What\u2019s more, he added, the research reveals the interplay of different evolutionary pressures, such as the need to convey the size of the animal and its identity, all while communicating efficiently.\nKello welcomed the study. \u201cLinguistic laws, like Zipf\u2019s law of brevity and the Menzerath-Altmann law, were originally discovered in text,\u201d he said, noting that meant it was initially thought that they arose from the symbolic nature of human language.\n\u201cThis new study provides more evidence that the laws are physical and not symbolic, because even penguins show them. Instead, the laws seem to reflect something deeper and more general about communication and information.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/feb/08/contact-is-limited-inside-the-worlds-coronavirus-quarantines-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/feb/08/contact-is-limited-inside-the-worlds-coronavirus-quarantines-video", "title": "'Contact is limited': inside the world's coronavirus quarantines \u2013 video", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 13:54:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>People who are being held in facilities in dozens of countries explain what daily life is like and their hopes for returning home soon.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.\nNew and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\nThe virus causes \n. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\nHuman to human transmission has been confirmed by China\u2019s national health commission, and there have been human-to-human transmissions in the US and \n. As of 8 February, the death toll stands at 722 inside China, one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. Infections inside China stand at 31,161 and global infections have passed 280 in 28 countries. The mortality rate is 2%.\nTwo members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and \n, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. \n, and British nationals are also among the 64 cases on a cruise liner off Japan.\nThe number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by \n (WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.\nWe don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about \n each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\nAnother key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\nUnless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The \n that people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP\u2019s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.\n experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has \n of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.\nHealthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region.

China provides around 15-16% of visitors to Australia but they are the biggest contributors to the Australian bottom line when they are here, outspending American tourists by a ratio of three to one. Their spending of $12-16bn is greater than American, British, Japanese and New Zealand tourists put together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the numbers of tourists \u2013 it\u2019s that they spend quite a lot because of the way they travel with packages, how they get around and spending on shopping,\u201d he says. \u201cIf that gets cut off it\u2019s a material impact on the economy in Australia.\u201d\nThe education sector \u2013 at $34bn, revenue from overseas students is \n \u2013 is also crucial, and again highlights how exposed Australia is if students cannot leave China to start their courses this month.\nThe ratings agency Moody\u2019s said on Friday that Australian universities will be harder hit than those of any other country because of the relatively high proportion of international students, one quarter of whom are from China.\nJoiner says that while mining might suffer in the short term \u2013 China declared force majeure on LNG shipments on Friday \u2013 it is likely to benefit from the stimulus measures Beijing is expected to use to kickstart things once the contagion ends.\nBut the service sector is different. \u201cYou can\u2019t give stimulus to people to go overseas,\u201d he says, \u201cand you\u2019ve got tourist destinations like Australia that now have restrictions on visitors.\u201d\nEconomists at JP Morgan \n that the coronavirus outbreak has \u201ccompletely changed the dynamics of the Chinese economy\u201d, although they agree with most experts that it is too early to forecast exactly what is going to happen.\nHowever, some partial data released on Friday suggests the scale of the problem that is emerging, with figures showing that property sales in China\u2019s so-called first-tier cities fell by 93% on 3-5 February compared with the same days last year. Railway passenger traffic was down 89% on 5 February.\nSo as well as the factory shutdown, Klassen points to the closure of many schools until the end of the month as a sign of paralysis and says that the resumption of normal activities involving large gatherings of people such as eating out, or going to the cinema and sporting events, seems unlikely for weeks or even months.\nThe global impact could be much greater than many expect and possibly even provide the kind of \n that could trigger a slump after the long boom enjoyed since 2009.\n\u201cThe economic impact might be enough to force the world economy into recession,\u201d he says, dismissing the prediction by Chinese officials on Friday that the economy will bounce back as it did after the Sars outbreak in 2003.\n\u201cPeople say it will be like Sars \u2026 But the Chinese economy was a quarter of the size back then. Hyundai saying this week they can\u2019t make cars any more [at its giant Ulsan plant in South Korea] because they haven\u2019t got any parts \u2013 that didn\u2019t happen back then.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pulled back all our holdings. There\u2019s no sense trying to squeeze any more from the lemon. I don\u2019t know what will trigger the end of the cycle but there\u2019s a pretty good chance that knocking out half of China\u2019s GDP for six months is going to do it.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-live-updates-in-china-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-cruise-ship-doctor-japan": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-live-updates-in-china-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-cruise-ship-doctor-japan", "title": "Coronavirus: cruise operator bans Chinese nationals from its ships \u2013 as it happened", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 18:36:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Total infections pass 30,000 as Wuhan whistleblower doctor dies and Singapore reports three new cases</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/wuhan-facing-wartime-conditions-as-china-tries-to-contain-coronavirus\">Full report: Wuhan facing \u2018wartime conditions\u2019</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/whistleblower-chinese-doctor-dies-from-coronavirus\">Doctor who blew whistle over virus dies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/ive-been-walking-stairs-for-exercise-life-under-coronavirus-quarantine\">\u2018Some idiot moaned about breakfast\u2019: life in coronavirus quarantine</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Share your stories</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T18:36:02.551Z\">6.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-07T18:19:06.102Z\">6.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>The cruise line operator Royal Caribbean has said it will refuse any passengers with Chinese, Hong Kong or Macao passports, regardless of when they were last in China. </p><p>The remarkable statement comes after reports that about two dozen passengers aboard a cruise ship that docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, on Friday morning were screened for coronavirus and four were sent to a local hospital for further screening.</p><p>Regardless of nationality, any guest or crew member traveling from, to, or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau less than 15 days prior to their sailing will be unable to board any of our ships.</p><p>Additionally, there will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on:</p><p>a.

But it\u2019s still not clear which animal is the missing link.\nFontanet believes the intermediary was \u201cprobably a mammal,\u201d possibly belonging to the badger family.\nAfter testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists at the South China Agricultural University found that the genome sequences of viruses in pangolins to be 99% identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nBut other experts urged caution. \u201cThis is not scientific evidence,\u201d said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. \u201cInvestigations into animal reservoirs are extremely important, but results must be then be published for international scrutiny.\u201d\n\u201cSimply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient,\u201d he added.\nTo conclusively identify the culprit, researchers would need to test each species that was on sale at the market \u2013 a near impossibility given that it is now permanently closed.\nMartine Peeters, a virologist at France\u2019s Institute for Research and Development (IRD), was part of the team that identified the host animal of the Ebola virus during recent epidemics.\nThey found that it was indeed a bat that passed the virus on to humans, and Peeters believes that is likely to be the case this time around. During her Ebola research, \u201cwe collected thousands of bat dropping from several sites in Africa,\u201d Peeters told AFP.\nFontanet said that the Chinese are carrying out research now.\n\u201cThey say they\u2019ve analysed samples from a rubbish truck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t say which, but I think it\u2019s likely to have been excrement that was just lying around.\u201d\nWhile it may be too late for this outbreak, identifying the carrier animal for the novel coronavirus could prove vital in preventing future flare-ups.\nChina, for example, outlawed the sale of civet for food during the Sars epidemic.\nEric Leroy, a virologist and vet at the IRD said that the search could well turn up a result quickly, as with Sars. Equally, it could take years. \u201cWith Ebola, research started in 1976 and we didn\u2019t see the first results published until 2005,\u201d he told AFP.\nOne determining factor could be what percentage of the same species are infected. \u201cIf that\u2019s low, less than 1% for example, that\u2019s obviously going to lower the chance you stumble upon an infected animal,\u201d said Leroy.\nFor Fontanet, coronavirus is just the latest example of the potentially disastrous consequence of humans consuming virus-carrying wild animals. He said that China needed to \u201ctake pretty radical measures against the sale of wild animals in markets\u201d.\nBeijing has prohibited the practice, but only moved to do so last month, when the outbreak was already out of control.\n\u201cEach time, we try to put out the fire, and once it\u2019s out we await the next one,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Renaud, a researcher at the Paris-based National Centre for Scientific Research.\nHe recommended compiling a watch list of all animals that could potentially transmit viruses to humans. \u201cYou need to see epidemics before they come, and therefore you need to be proactive,\u201d he said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/popularity-of-pug-flat-nosed-dogs-could-be-fuelling-rise-in-canine-fertility-clinics": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/popularity-of-pug-flat-nosed-dogs-could-be-fuelling-rise-in-canine-fertility-clinics", "title": "Popularity of pug-like dogs 'could be fuelling rise in canine fertility clinics'", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 07:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>Investigation links boom in flat-faced canines to rise in clinics, some of which advertise banned procedures</p><p>The boom in popularity of flat-faced dogs such as pugs and French bulldogs may be fuelling a rise in canine fertility clinics, some of which advertise banned procedures, an investigation has found.</p><p>Dogs with squashed faces, known as brachycephalic dogs, are often unable to breed or give birth naturally due to their extreme anatomy: the animals\u2019 small hips can make mating difficult, meaning breeders turn to artificial insemination, while they also mean caesarean sections are often necessary since the puppies have disproportionately large heads.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/popularity-of-pug-flat-nosed-dogs-could-be-fuelling-rise-in-canine-fertility-clinics\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The boom in popularity of flat-faced dogs such as pugs and French bulldogs may be fuelling a rise in canine fertility clinics, some of which advertise banned procedures, an investigation has found.\n with squashed faces, known as brachycephalic dogs, are often unable to breed or give birth naturally due to their extreme anatomy: the animals\u2019 small hips can make mating difficult, meaning breeders turn to artificial insemination, while they also mean caesarean sections are often necessary since the puppies have disproportionately large heads.\nThe dogs\u2019 breathing difficulties \u2013 a result of their ultra-short snout \u2013 can also make it difficult for them to mate.\nYet despite the risk of this and other problems, including skin and eye conditions, the clamour for such dogs has been huge. According to \n, registrations of French bulldogs alone has risen from 1,521 in 2009 to 36,785 in 2018. Over the same period, the use of artificial insemination in dogs has also risen.\nNow an investigation \n has found there are currently at least 37 canine fertility clinics in the UK \u2013 as discovered through internet searching. In 2015, a \n on a clinic suggested the existence of such a facility was noteworthy and unusual. That, they say, suggests there has been a rise in such clinics.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be 100% sure but it seems highly likely that this is fuelled by demand for flat-faced dogs,\u201d said Josh Loeb, a reporter and co-author of the investigation for the Vet Record. \n\u201cThere has been rising public demand for these dogs, and these breeds tend to need human assistance in order to be able to breed,\u201d he said.\nThe report reveals that 20 of the clinics offered flat-faced dogs as studs, while examination of the websites by the Guardian found many illustrated with images of such breeds. Indeed, some clinics appear to be entirely devoted to brachycephalic dogs. \nServices on offer range from artificial insemination to ultrasound scans, sperm motility testing, microchipping, progesterone testing and, in some cases, caesarean sections.\nLoeb and colleagues found some of these clinics are linked to veterinary surgeries, while others are run through basic websites with limited contact details.\nThe researchers say the findings raise several concerns. Some procedures can only be carried out by a vet, including caesarean sections and artificial insemination involving \n. Loeb and colleagues note that while it is possible clinics without a vet may hire one for such procedures, it is not clear whether they do so.\nWhat\u2019s more, the team found two clinics advertising an invasive form of artificial insemination that was banned in the UK last year. Upon contacting the clinics, they were told the website information was incorrect and would be removed.\nLoeb said the findings raise questions, including whether anyone is monitoring what happens in such clinics.\n\u201cUnlike businesses that breed and sell dogs, those offering stud dogs, canine artificial insemination and ultrasound scans do not require a licence to operate,\u201d the report notes. \u201cThey are not generally regulated unless they offer services that are clearly acts of veterinary surgery.\u201d\n that breeding flat-faced dogs using artificial insemination and caesareans may even be unlawful, pointing to regulations that say dogs should not be kept for breeding if their genes or other traits suggest breeding would harm the health or welfare of the parent or offspring.\n \u201cThere are lots of procedures that can be done to animals that are banned, because they are seen as mutilations because they are purely for aesthetic purposes,\u201d Loeb told the Guardian. \u201cIf you think about it, this is another example of that.\u201d\nBut Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said artificial insemination is now used for many breeds and can bring genetic benefits, while non-vets can be very skilled in aspects of canine fertility that can be practised without veterinary qualifications. Professional support, he added, can help inexperienced breeders ensure safety and good conditions.\n\u201cWhere veterinary procedures are not involved then sometimes you can get extremely experienced people who are not vets but they are maybe more experienced in certain areas,\u201d he said. \nDaniella Dos Santos, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the organisation was deeply concerned about the advertising of banned procedures, adding that while other forms of artificial insemination are allowed and important for breeding, a vet should be involved in their use.\nThat said, she stressed, the process is not suitable for all dogs \u2013 including those who cannot mate or give birth naturally.\n\u201cWe would be concerned about artificial insemination being used in such cases, or to allow dogs with inherited diseases and conditions, for example brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome in flat-faced dogs, to be used for breeding,\u201d she said. \u201cVets will often recommend that these dogs are neutered.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia", "title": "Concerns coronavirus is going undetected in Indonesia", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:53:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>World\u2019s fourth most populous country says it has no confirmed cases despite close links to China</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-live-updates-in-china-wuhan-coronavirus-outbreak-cruise-ship-doctor-japan\">Coronavirus - latest updates</a></li></ul><p>There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China.</p><p>As of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/concerns-coronavirus-is-going-undetected-in-indonesia\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "There is growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in \n, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection among the 272 million-strong population despite the country\u2019s close links to China.\nAs of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms, although it said they hadn\u2019t been tested.\nMore than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally.

The trending topic \u201cwe want freedom of speech\u201d, which attracted millions of views, and links to Do You Hear the People Sing, a song popularised in recent Hong Kong protests, were quickly censored by police.\nIn an unusual move, the Communist party\u2019s powerful internal discipline enforcement agency swiftly announced it would dispatch investigators to Wuhan to look into \u201cquestions raised by the masses\u201d associated with Li. The Chinese authorities are starkly aware that anger and raw emotions could easily boil over and spill on to the streets.\nAs in the past when health or safety scandals broke, it is likely the Chinese government will fire a few local officials to douse public anger. But this will only be an expedient measure that will not resolve the real problem \u2013 its citizens\u2019 lack of a right to free speech.\nWe might remember a similar health crisis 17 years ago when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, which also originated from \n, infected more than 8,000 and killed about 800 across 17 countries. In 2003, the authorities covered up the disease for months before another whistleblowing doctor, 72-year-old Jiang Yanyong, exposed the crisis.\nUnfortunately, China does not appear to have learned lessons from the Sars epidemic.\nDespite the flourishing of social media, information is more tightly controlled in China than ever. In 2013, an internal Communist party edict known as Document No 9 ordered cadres to tackle seven supposedly subversive influences on society. These included western-inspired notions of press freedom, \u201cuniversal values\u201d of human rights, civil rights and civic participation. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership.\nCompared with 17 years ago, Chinese citizens enjoy even fewer rights of speech and expression. A few days after 34-year-old Li posted a note in his medical school alumni social media group on 30 December, stating that seven workers from a local live-animal market had been diagnosed with an illness similar to Sars and were quarantined in his hospital, he was summoned by police. He was made to sign a humiliating statement saying he understood if he \u201cstayed stubborn and failed to repent and continue illegal activities, (he) will be disciplined by the law\u201d.\nChina\u2019s GDP per capita might have grown nearly eight times from 2003 but its citizens have not enjoyed more freedom and rights, which many predicted would come with rising economic achievements.\nIf Li had lived in a society where citizens could speak freely without fear of being punished for exposing problems the authorities would rather not see and if his warning had been heeded and action swiftly taken, the virus could have been contained. Instead, it has already killed at least 724 and infected nearly 35,000 people, and the virus is still spreading.\nUnless Chinese citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and other basic rights are respected, such crises will only happen again. With a more globalised world, the magnitude may become even greater \u2013 the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak is already comparable to the total Sars death toll.\nHuman rights in China may appear to have little to do with the rest of the world but as we have seen in this crisis, disaster could occur when China thwarts the freedoms of its citizens. Surely it is time the international community takes this issue more seriously.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/madonna-in-full-meltdown-moment-to-be-cherished": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/madonna-in-full-meltdown-moment-to-be-cherished", "title": "Madonna in full meltdown a moment to be cherished  | Rebecca Nicholson", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 15:30:40 GMT", "summary": "The Palladium paid a ripe price for bringing down the curtain on her show<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51398169\" title=\"\">Madonna\u2019s Madame X</a> era is the gift that keeps on giving.

Censorship, censorship, motherfuckers censorship.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t open her next album, I\u2019ll eat my eyepatch.\nI love it when it all goes wrong. I bet the audience was thrilled that they had that ticket for that night. Some of the most memorable shows I\u2019ve ever seen have had an element of upset. I remember the Gossip, playing upstairs at a tiny pub, many years ago, having the same issue as Madonna: they overran and the sound was cut. Beth Ditto came to the front of the stage and sang, a cappella, in pure defiance, a song called (Take Back) the Revolution. I\u2019ve seen thousands of shows and that remains one of the very best.\nYou can\u2019t contrive it, either. I saw a play a couple of years ago in which the lead actors appeared to corpse, and it was genuinely delightful, until we realised days later that it was not genuine. We thought we were witnessing something fresh, off-script, spontaneous.\nWhen I talked to relatives who had seen the same play, the exact same thing had happened and they felt special too. It didn\u2019t matter on the night, but we\u2019d been had. Just like \n bringing Stevie and Lindsey together for a pointed reunion hug (when Lindsey was still there to be reunited with), it was all part of the script, after all.\nThe Conservative commentator \n went off-script on \n on Friday, when he decided not to stand his ground as he was being interrupted, but to storm off instead. \u201cOK, I won\u2019t speak,\u201d he said, when being talked over, like me during a domestic about washing up. I can\u2019t begin to process the irony of walking off a show now built entirely on talking over people \u2013 for being talked over. I realised then I only ever watch \n when something has gone wrong. In ratings terms, at least, wrong can so often be right.\nThe astronaut \n \u2013 and my new hero \u2013 last week came back to Earth a record-breaker, having spent 328 days in space, the longest continuous spaceflight a woman has ever undertaken. Koch landed in Kazakhstan nearly a year after she left the planet and gave the cameras, staff and supporters a huge grin and a double thumbs-up.\nI\u2019ve been reading and watching interviews with Koch as a kind of balm, a self-prescribed alternative to inspirational Instagram quotes decorated with illustrations of flowers and birds. When her mission was extended, she told \n that that was just fine. \u201cOne of the things about the astronaut corps is we are taught to be adaptable and ready for anything in any mission that comes our way,\u201d she said. I\u2019ve had it printed on to a mug.\nWhen she surpassed the previous record, set by \n, in December, she told CNN that we should all challenge ourselves. \u201cDo what scares you. Everyone should think about what intrigues them and what draws them in. Those things can be scary, but they usually mean you\u2019re interested.\u201d That one\u2019s getting framed and going up in the loo.\nKoch\u2019s achievements have been truly remarkable. In October she completed the first all-female spacewalk, along with Jessica Meir, though that was \n when only one suit could be found that would fit a woman. Her experiences will prove invaluable to research into how long periods of time in space affect the body, particularly women\u2019s bodies, which may well react differently to the extreme conditions. Also, having been quite literally out of this world since last March, Koch has missed coronavirus, the impeachment fiasco, Brexit, still, Australia being on fire and the USA-Iran crisis, so I\u2019d say it was all worth it.\nThe collected works of \n will need to add a page or two, as four new poems have been linked to the great writer, almost a century after they were published anonymously.\nThe tale of their discovery is a detective story in itself. In the 1990s, a lawyer called Stuart Y Silverstein came across the poems in an old copy of \n magazine, thought they sounded like Parker\u2019s work, made a copy of the page and scribbled a note \u2013 \u201cParker?\u201d \u2013 at the top of it. He did not return to the paper until last year, when he managed to link it to the archive of a payment made by \n to Parker, for $50, thus authenticating the work.\nIt is no wonder Silverstein suspected Parker\u2019s acidic wit. The poems are verse portraits that are entirely unforgiving of their subjects. Of the sculptor Clare Sheridan, who had turned to journalism, she wrote: \u201cThen the lady\u2019s interviews/ Crashed upon the daily news;/ Moan we now another lay \u2013 \u2018Give, oh, give her back her clay!\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s amazing how much more sophisticated put-downs sound in verse. Perhaps Twitter should start insisting that if insults are to be thrown, they should at least be thrown in rhyme.\n Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows", "title": "Signs of cancer can appear long before diagnosis, study shows", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:20:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>Research into genetic mutations suggests possibility of tests that would detect cancer earlier</p><p>Early signs of cancer can appear years or even decades before diagnosis, according to the most comprehensive investigation to date of the genetic mutations that cause healthy cells to turn malignant.</p><p>The findings, based on samples from more than 2,500 tumours and 38 cancer types, reveal a longer-than-expected window of opportunity in which patients could potentially be tested and treated at the earliest stages of the disease.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/how-to-write-perfect-to-do-list": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/how-to-write-perfect-to-do-list", "title": "What a to-do!

She doesn\u2019t like calling them \u201cto-do lists\u201d. \u201cI refer to them as action lists,\u201d she says. To create an effective action list, fill it with things on which you will truly take action; don\u2019t create a giant inventory of random, and perhaps unimportant, tasks.\nList a maximum of 10 tasks for the day. \u201cRealistically, how much can you fit in? It might be five or six things, or only one. Identify the most important thing you need to do today and how long each task is going to take.\u201d Know that you will almost certainly underestimate this. \u201cAllocate time in the day when you\u2019re going to do it,\u201d says Evans. \nEvans\nrecommends tackling the task you are least looking forward to first. Roy Baumeister, a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and the co-author of \n, advises including \u201csome easy things as well as the harder ones. You can start right away on a couple of easy ones, get those out of the way, and have a good feeling of making progress. But given that willpower is limited, you should not squander it all on the easy ones \u2013 treat those as warm-ups.\u201d Tasks should be specific and small, he says. \u201cRather than \u2018clean out and paint garage\u2019, maybe start with \u2018buy paint\u2019 and \u2018fill one trash barrel\u2019, and so on.\u201d\nIdeally, says Morgenstern, you wouldn\u2019t keep a to-do list at all \u2013 \u201cyour to-dos should be integrated into your calendar immediately. It enables you to account for and plan your days realistically. For every to-do, how long is it going to take and when are you going to do it? Wednesday morning? Saturday afternoon? Then you have no list, but a plan.\u201d\nThat said, it is helpful to keep a master list somewhere, to capture every looming task, she says. Morganstern recommends sub-dividing it to avoid chaos or feeling overwhelmed. \u201cIt could be work versus home life. Within your work, it could be administrative, writing, marketing and team tasks.\u201d\nThis should help with working through them \u2013 once you have scheduled them. \u201cWe should execute by category \u2013 batch processing. Do all your financial stuff at one time, all your marketing stuff, all your people stuff. That\u2019s a more efficient way to operate than switching back and forth.\u201d\nOnce you have completed some tasks that you had been putting off, should you give yourself a reward? These can be useful \u201cif there are things you don\u2019t like to do and need to motivate yourself to do,\u201d says Morgenstern. But for most tasks the satisfaction of getting something done \u2013 and the freedom from that nagging feeling \u2013 is more than enough. \u201cI think getting to-dos done is the reward for most people. People crave accomplishment.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government", "title": "This is the age of the megafire \u2013 and it\u2019s being fuelled by our leaders | Tim Flannery", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>In the face of the climate disaster it helped create, the Australian government has given us only lies and denial</p><p>Unprecedented wildfires have recently devastated California, the Amazon, southern Europe, Siberia and Australia.

It\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve entered the era of the climate-fuelled megafire.

As I write, fires continue to burn around Canberra, and though rain has begun to fall in northern New South Wales, 17 are \u201cyet to be contained\u201d according to the \n. Meanwhile, what is traditionally the worst part of the fire season for Victoria and South Australia is just commencing. Conditions have been so severe that firefighters have often been unable to stop fires joining up, generating massive dry thunderstorms that spread fire with thousands of lightning strikes.\nSo far the fires have burned an area around the size of England, killed \n and destroyed about \n. They have left deep psychological scars, and while it seems impossible to shift the \n, the fires will alter the way that Australians view themselves and their country.\nThere\u2019s a British saying that fire is a good servant but a bad master. But in Australia, with its unique vegetation and climate, fire can also be a terrifying predator. Like all good predators, it remains hidden until it\u2019s ready to strike, so even in this fire-plagued year, most Australians have not seen the flames that lurk in the forest, taking life seemingly at random. But many have smelt its stench. Sometimes we wake at night to thickening smoke, and lie there wondering where the beast is prowling. Some mornings we peer out the window and decide that it is not a safe day to be outside.\nThis year fire struck Australia when its guard was down, trapping tens of thousands of people while they were enjoying their summer vacations. The sight of Australians disembarking from warships on naval regulation gangways reminded us that, in this new Australia, the fiery beast that lurks in the forest can make anyone a temporary climate refugee.\nIncreasingly, Australian fire harasses its victims for weeks or months before striking. You prepare for its onslaught, only for the flames to turn aside at the last moment. You prepare the buckets, hoses and other equipment again and again, while fire weakens you with its smoke and debilitating heat. It can also trap you, as if you\u2019re a mouse in a corner. You wait, with fire all around, and all exits cut, your fate in the hands of the wind. If you are lucky enough to survive, you can remain trapped for weeks as you wait for roads to be cleared and made safe.\nWhen the predator finally does pounce, it does so with extraordinary fickleness. One house is left standing, while all around are smouldering ashes; one fire truck is picked up by a fire tornado and overturned, while nearby no wind is felt. Why me, both the fortunate and unfortunate ask?\nThe psychological impact of such experiences is profound. I\u2019ve lost a house to bushfire, and successfully defended another. When I look into the eyes of the fire-hunted, I see the same expression I\u2019ve seen in the eyes of returned soldiers or traumatised refugees. Bushfire triggers a primeval fear, one that has been plaguing our ancestors since the first ape was plucked from its family, carried away and consumed by a big cat.\nFew things matter as much to Australians as their homes and communities. More than \n have been destroyed so far by the fires. And even when those affected do have insurance, history shows that \n. The fires will doubtless also spark new regulations, which will make rebuilding more expensive.\nSome people now face the prospect of leaving or remaining homeless in stricken regional economies. All of us are less resilient to future shock \u2013 and future shocks there will be. Natural climate variation might have brought a year as hot as 2019 to Australia \n, but greenhouse gas pollution has increased that frequency to one in eight. And every day the coalfires burn in Australia and elsewhere, we\u2019re shortening those odds \u2013 adding to the severity of the fires of tomorrow.\nRight now, many Australians are simply exhausted. They have been deprived of their summer vacations and beset by debilitating smoke. And as the immediate trauma slowly fades, other impacts will emerge. \nare already reporting health effects from inhalation of bushfire smoke, and over the longer term more and more consequences will be felt. Some medical researchers fear that the consequences of smoke exposure from this year\u2019s fires will be felt for generations.\nAny credible response to such a massive national catastrophe needs to be proportionate to the danger. Instead the government response has been risible. It wants to plant more trees to capture carbon, but also wants more coal burned and more forest cleared, so there will be less to catch fire when the next big fire comes. Its previous climate denialism has been revealed as a catastrophic error, but it remains paralysed in the face of a disaster it helped create.\nIf Australia was being threatened by an external enemy, Scott Morrison\u2019s government would be doing everything within its power to recruit allies. It would put the economy on a war footing, and raise arms. But when it comes to climate-fuelled catastrophes, it claims that there\u2019s nothing it can do: Australians have to remain among the world\u2019s worst greenhouse gas polluters, and keep spoiling international efforts to address the problem. To do otherwise, the government says, would be \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d. But guess what? There is a solution \u2013 burn more fossil fuels, especially gas. To an increasing number of Australians these lies are nauseating. The words of our prime minister sound like the words of a traitor. \nWhat does one do when immense evil is occurring in one\u2019s country? As far as swift climate action is concerned, all good choices have gone up in smoke, and only difficult, divisive options remain. Australians marched against the Vietnam war, and prevailed. But they also protested against the horrific treatment of asylum seekers, and so far have failed. Now we shall see how communities, businesses and politicians respond to this crisis in \u201cthe lucky country\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low", "title": "When it comes to climate hypocrisy, Canada's leaders have reached a new low | Bill McKibben", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:30:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>A territory that has 0.5% of the Earth\u2019s population plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget<br></p><p>Americans elected Donald Trump, who insisted climate change was a hoax \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that since taking office he\u2019s been all-in for the fossil fuel industry.

Yet the country\u2019s leaders seem likely in the next few weeks to approve a vast new tar sands mine which will pour carbon into the atmosphere through the 2060s. They know \u2013 yet they can\u2019t bring themselves to act on the knowledge. Now that \n cause for despair.\nThe Teck mine would be the biggest tar sands mine yet: 113 square miles of petroleum mining, located just 16 miles from the border of Wood Buffalo national park. A federal panel \n the mine despite conceding that it would likely be harmful to the environment and to the land culture of Indigenous people. These giant tar sands mines (easily visible on Google Earth) are already among the biggest scars humans have ever carved on the planet\u2019s surface. But Canadian authorities ruled that the mine was nonetheless in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d.\nHere\u2019s how Justin Trudeau, recently re-elected as Canada\u2019s prime minister, \n in a speech to cheering Texas oilmen a couple of years ago: \u201cNo country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there.\u201d That is to say, Canada, which is 0.5% of the planet\u2019s population, plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget. Ottawa hides all this behind a \n about \u201cnet-zero emissions by 2050\u201d and so on, but they are empty promises. In the here-and-now they can\u2019t rein themselves in. There\u2019s oil in the ground and it must come out.\nThis is painfully hard to watch because it comes as the planet has supposedly reached a turning point. A series of remarkable young people (including Canadians such as Autumn Peltier) have captured the imagination of people around the world; scientists have issued ever sterner warnings; and the images of climate destruction show up in every newspaper. Canadians \n the Australian blazes on television; they should bring back memories of the devastating forest fires that forced the \n, in the heart of the tar sands complex, less than four years ago.\nThe only rational response would be to immediately stop the expansion of new fossil fuel projects. It\u2019s true that we can\u2019t get off oil and gas immediately; for the moment, oil wells continue to pump. But the Teck Frontier proposal is predicated on the idea that we\u2019ll still need vast quantities of oil in 2066, when Greta Thunberg is about to hit retirement age. If an alcoholic assured you he was taking his condition very seriously, but also laying in a 40-year store of bourbon, you\u2019d be entitled to doubt his sincerity, or at least to note his confusion. \n has addled the Canadian ability to do basic math: more does not equal less, and 2066 is not any time soon. An emergency means you act now.\nIn fairness, Canada has company here. For every territory making a sincere effort to kick fossil fuels (California, Scotland) there are other capitals just as paralyzed as Ottawa. Australia\u2019s fires creep ever closer to the seat of government in Canberra, yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, can\u2019t seem to imagine any future for his nation other than mining more coal. Australia and Canada are both rich nations, their people highly educated, but they seem unable to control the zombie momentum of fossil fuels.\nThere\u2019s obviously something hideous about watching the Trumps and the Putins of the world gleefully shred our future. But it\u2019s disturbing in a different way to watch leaders \n to care \u2013 a kind of gaslighting that can reduce you to numb nihilism. Trudeau, for all his charms, doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways: if you can\u2019t bring yourself to stop a brand-new tar sands mine then you\u2019re not a climate leader.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/hiring-new-whitehall-geniuses-pouring-water-leaky-jug": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/hiring-new-whitehall-geniuses-pouring-water-leaky-jug", "title": "Hiring new Whitehall geniuses is like pouring water into a leaky jug |  Nitika Agarwal", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:34:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>To transform the civil service, look to Canada or Portugal for ways to unlock the treasure trove of talent</p><p>The floodgates are open: Dominic Cummings is well on his way, apparently, to recruiting \u201ctrue cognitive diversity\u201d into government.

But a few new people in No 10, however maverick, will make little difference. The whole machine needs to change if Cummings is to achieve the vision of a responsive, citizen-centred, 21st-century government.\nThe good news, contrary to what some reformists suggest, is that there are many smart, creative thinkers and doers already in government. But unless Whitehall works in ways that fully leverage its 430,000-strong workforce, hiring more geniuses is like pouring water into a leaky jug.\nIt\u2019s time government unlocked the talent it already has.\nWhitehall already employs more than 23,000 policy specialists and more than 16,800 technology, data, scientific and economic specialists, according to the \n. They include professionals such as senior data scientists or, say, the role of \n in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2014 people similar to the gems Cummings is looking for.\nThe bad news is that this wealth of expertise isn\u2019t being used. According to Vicky Pryce, former joint head of the UK Government Economics Service, there has already been at least one previous attempt, in the late 2000s, to identify scientific experts in Whitehall departments in the light of challenges such as climate breakdown. There were, indeed, many scientists across the civil service \u2013 but most were working on policy that had absolutely nothing to do with their specialism. \nTo unleash civil servants\u2019 full potential, the government needs to match them to the right jobs. For inspiration, it could look to Canada, which is developing an internationally acclaimed \n. Here, employees can highlight all their transferable skills in digital profiles visible to potential managers. If it followed suit, No 10 could unearth a treasure trove of skills across Whitehall. \nBritain could also study overseas attempts at fundamentally remixing the state to make it more nimble and responsive. The New Zealand government, for example, is \n such as mental health and child poverty. By building cross-departmental project teams, the government promises a stop to endless restructuring and petty turf wars.\nPortugal, meanwhile, is the first country in the world to legislate for a policy \u201csandbox\u201d at the centre of government. More common in financial services than in policy, idea of a sandbox is to test policies swiftly before wider implementation.\nEven when great people are in the right job in government, there\u2019s little point in having one of \n if it doesn\u2019t work effectively with ministers and their special advisers.\nFor instance, Nick Hillman, former special adviser to David Willetts, the minister for universities and science from 2010-13, recalls when senior civil servants responsible for higher education policy said they were too busy to attend meetings he had set up with private providers, despite it being a top ministerial priority.\nThe relationship between the apolitical and political echelons of the civil service have been strained in the past three years. Momentum on Brexit and an ambitious domestic agenda present an opportunity to rebuild mutual respect and get more done as a result. The government can do this by appointing special advisers who are genuine experts in their field, and formally inducting both civil servants and special advisers on how to make best use of their respective remits.\nPerhaps the best thing Cummings can do to unleash the smart brains in the civil service is to encourage calculated risk-taking. This is counter to its predominant culture of avoiding failure at all costs, which can make disruptors feel isolated and unsupported.\nThere are good reasons for the government machine to guard its reputation and taxpayer funds. But it is possible to carve out a fraction of funds for experimentation, with the understanding that while failure is likely, it\u2019s worth it for the possibility of real change. These small, high-risk funding pots can exist alongside the rest of government funding, which is bound by the usual caution and restraint. \nThis is how investment works, by splitting up money between high, medium and low-risk projects. In its innovation grants to private companies, the government already takes this approach, and it is an attitude that can also be used to support experimentation inside government itself. Both \n, factoring government-led innovation funding into their national budgets.\nThis government has the opportunity to take bold action. Creating a more dynamic civil service could be a powerful tool for change. \nNitika Agarwal is chief operating officer at \n, a global learning platform for public servants\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/diary-of-a-coronavirus-evacuee-everyones-trying-to-avoid-contact-with-each-other": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/diary-of-a-coronavirus-evacuee-everyones-trying-to-avoid-contact-with-each-other", "title": "Diary of a coronavirus evacuee: 'Everyone's trying to avoid contact with each other' | Daniel Ou Yang", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 07:42:30 GMT", "summary": "<p>Australian Daniel Ou Yang, 21, was on the Air New Zealand flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland.

After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I\u2019ll look after myself from there on.\nThere were a lot of us evacuating, with two or three other countries including us. Everyone\u2019s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport.\nI found myself a quiet spot, and talked to my family and friends on my phone until we started lining up to get our boarding pass.\nAt 4.30pm they told us after getting our boarding pass to wait for the security clearance to be opened, but to line up first because they\u2019ll be a lot of different countries evacuating at once all through one entrance.\nIt wasn\u2019t until around 9.30pm that they started processing everyone. Our flight was due to leave at 11pm.\nI originally lined up behind everyone, again nervous of the close proximity. As it reached 10pm, I saw a lot of Chinese rushing to the front, and I was encouraged to join them, so I did. They were all going on the same Auckland flight as me, so we were allowed to cut the queue to be processed first.\nI felt a bit guilty, all these foreigners looking at us cutting the line, maybe they will think that we are getting special treatment because we are Chinese.\nThere was this lady with her two young kids also evacuating and they were running late. I waited for them to bring them with me through the security. From there everyone was wearing full hazmat suits.\nIt took us an hour to finally get through to immigration and the last security check point before our flight gate 334. It was already 11.10pm.\nI got through but the lady was stopped because she had ice skating shoes in the carry on which weren\u2019t allowed. I told her to just leave them, but she was unwilling to. In the end, it was 11.20pm and I said I needed to go make the flight and I\u2019ll tell them to wait for her and her kids.\nIt was a huge rush and I thought I missed it because there was no one at the gate. But I made it just in time. I was on the phone to the embassy letting them know about the lady and kids. I hope they made it on.\nThe flight itself wasn\u2019t too bad, but we were delayed so didn\u2019t leave until 1am.\nAfter having a really late dinner (or early breakfast) I fell asleep very quickly. Luckily there was a spare seat next to me so I sat next to the window and a girl sat on the other end, leaving plenty of space for each other.\nWe were supplied with masks and hand sanitisers along with the normal flight care package. I woke up at 10 and went to the bathroom. We were encouraged to leave our seat as little as possible so I was hesitant.\nUsed a lot of hand sanitisers throughout the flight along with everyone else. Everyone is just trying to avoid contact with each other as much as possible and constantly using hand sanitisers.\nWe\u2019ve arrived at New Zealand now. I have to prepare myself for another long flight back to Christmas Island, \n. I\u2019m nervous about being there.\nI heard from others there\u2019s barely any wifi and no reception. There is nothing to do. Hopefully the facility is clean, and I can be out of there smoothly.

How \u2013 when dealing with a health crisis or a humanitarian disaster \u2013 you are limited in the choice and nature of your partners in the place where it is occurring, and the limitations they impose.\nBut if the politics of such accommodations is always uncomfortable, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak encapsulates in a stark fashion a number of difficult issues.\nAbove all, it asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states.\nLooming above all else is the fact that China is a country whose trajectory under Xi Jinping has been to become more, not less, authoritarian, marked by \n for Uighurs, a growing internet crackdown and its \nto street protests in Hong Kong.\nThere seems little doubt either that China\u2019s bureaucratic culture of control and secrecy, including the local government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the information emerging about the disease in the first weeks of the epidemic, contributed to its initial spread in December and the first weeks of January.\nIt is also true that after admitting the scale of the problem, China has shared much information internationally, in line with its commitments, about the nature and spread of the virus, and deployed unprecedented and costly national efforts in a bid to contain the outbreak, even as it has employed what many would see as draconian restrictions.\nInterposed into the midst of all this has been the WHO \u2013 and Tedros \u2013 a relationship complicated by the fact that China is a major donor to the world health body. The mix of health and international politics has been underlined by the \n even after the coronavirus spread there.\nThe argument about how the WHO has negotiated the complexities boils down to several key questions.\nThe first is whether the organisation should have pushed harder for Beijing to be more forthcoming when evidence of a new form of coronavirus first emerged, but before the scale of the outbreak was fully acknowledged. And whether the head of the UN body should have been so warm in praising the response of a country that unsettles so many for its secrecy and rights violations.\nIn particular, the fraught politics of the WHO \n a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) has once again come under the spotlight in the same way it did during the \n in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nSome of those most critical have parsed Xi\u2019s meeting with Tedros \u2013 and Xi\u2019s declared hope that the UN body would assess the \u201cepidemic situation in an objective, just, calm and reasonable way\u201d \u2013 as pressure from Beijing to ensure WHO would refrain from designating the epidemic a global health emergency to protect China\u2019s economy.\nAlthough that didn\u2019t happen, the WHO\u2019s advice \u2013 contrary to that of many governments \u2013 is that it still \u201cadvises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u201d.\nAnd on this front some are pointing to a startling contradiction: how the UN body has praised the extreme internal travel restrictions in China while criticising other countries for implementing their own travel measures.\nSources familiar with the politics at the top of the organisation, and the decision over declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, insist that WHO have had to balance very difficult issues.\nWith China\u2019s well-known history of extreme sensitivity to criticism, the argument goes, a conscious decision was made to prioritise diplomacy that would encourage China to be as open as possible in sharing information with international researchers and health bodies even at the risk of drawing inevitable criticism.\n\u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December,\u201d said one close observer. \u201cThe organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there were two options: to keep pressing behind the scenes, or to go public and say at a press conference we didn\u2019t get such and such at this time and for the Chinese to lose face and slam the door. So it seems like a deliberate decision to keep the flow of data coming, to encourage the Chinese to keep focused on the epicentre, even at the risk of being seen in public as kissing up to Beijing.\u201d\nAnd while insiders point to China\u2019s preparedness to come clean and admit mistakes once its central government had realised the scale of the threat, critics counter that greater pressure from WHO might have made that moment come days earlier, potentially helping contain the epidemic at an earlier stage.\nIn the end, whether the current diplomacy was the right approach in balancing the demands of human rights and global risk and the threat to China\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) economy and prestige, only the course of the outbreak will confirm.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/27/did-you-solve-it-toot-toot-for-world-palindrome-day": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/27/did-you-solve-it-toot-toot-for-world-palindrome-day", "title": "Did you solve it?

In other words, POCO is a four digit number, and MUCHO is a five digit number. \nCan you work out which letter stands for which digit so that the sum makes sense?\n POCO is 4595 and MUCHO is 68925\nFor fifteen letter Os to add up to a number ending in the letter O, then O is either 0 (zero) or 5. Let\u2019s say that O is 0 (zero). In this case, fifteen Cs must be CH. The only digits that fit are C = 1 and H = 5. The number MU, therefore, is 15 x P, which means that U must be an 0 (zero) or a 5. But both of those numbers are already taken by the letter O and H. So we can eliminate the case that O is 0, and deduce that O = 5.\nIf O = 5, the carry into the tens column is 7, since 5 x 15 = 75.\nWe can eliminate some of the candidates for C. To start, C cannot be 1, since then 15 x C + 7 = 22, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundred\u2019s column, which would mean that the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 1.\nWe can also eliminate values from 2 to 8 for C, shown here for completeness:\nIf C = 2, then 15 x C + 7 = 37, which means there is a carry of 3 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 8. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 2.\nIf C = 3, then 15 x C + 7 = 52, which means there is a carry of 5 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 0. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 3.\nIf C = 4, then 15 x C + 7 = 67, which means there is a carry of 6 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 1. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 4.\nIf C = 5, then 15 x C + 7 = 82, which means there is a carry of 8 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 3. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 5.\nIf C = 6, then 15 x C + 7 = 97, which means there is a carry of 9 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 4. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 6.\nIf C = 7, then 15 x C + 7 = 112, which means there is a carry of 1 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 6. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 7.\nIf C = 8, then 15 x C + 7 = 127, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 8.\nSo C must be 9. If C = 9, then 15 x C + 7 = 142, which means there is a carry of 4 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which means the C in MUCHO is also a 9.\nIf C = 9, H = 2, and the thousands column has a carry of 7 + 1 = 8. In other words 15P + 8 = MU. P must be between 1 and 6, since MU is less than 100. We have as candidates 1, 3, 4, 6. We can eliminate 1, since this makes MU 23, and 2 is taken. We can eliminate 3, since this makes MU 53 and 5 is taken. We can eliminate 6 because this makes MU 98 and 9 is taken. So P = 4, M= 6 and U = 8.\nGracias!\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/13/can-you-solve-it-the-poco-poco-puzzle": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/13/can-you-solve-it-the-poco-poco-puzzle", "title": "Can you solve it?

By Andrew Marantz</p><p>In 2012, a small group of young men, former supporters of the libertarian Republican congressman Ron Paul, started a blog called The Right Stuff. They soon began calling themselves \u201cpost-libertarians,\u201d although they weren\u2019t yet sure what would come next. By 2014, they\u2019d started to self-identify as \u201calt-right\u201d. They developed a countercultural tone \u2013 arch, antic, floridly offensive \u2013 that appealed to a growing cohort of disaffected young men, searching for meaning and addicted to the internet. These young men often referred to The Right Stuff, approvingly, as a key part of a \u201clibertarian-to-far-right pipeline\u201d, a path by which \u201cnormies\u201d could advance, through a series of epiphanies, toward \u201cfull radicalisation\u201d.

On Facebook, they posted Photoshopped images, or parody songs, or \u201ccountersignal memes\u201d \u2013 sardonic line drawings designed to spark just enough cognitive dissonance to shock normies out of their complacency. On Twitter, the alt-right trolled and harassed mainstream journalists, hoping to work the referees of the national discourse while capturing the attention of the wider public. On Reddit and 4chan and 8chan, where the content moderation was so lax as to be almost non-existent, the memes were more overtly vile. Many alt-right trolls started calling themselves \u201cfashy\u201d, or \u201cfash-ist\u201d.

Thanks to these miniature overlords many of us now boast the attention span (and manners) of a toddler, and, like prisoners on parole, are physically incapable of moving about without our electronic monitoring devices on us at all times.\nWhen adults behave this way it\u2019s depressing and odd, but when teenagers step into this world \u2013 not having known an alternative reality \u2013 the problem becomes a social concern.\nHealth experts have warned of a spike in anxiety and depression in teenagers addicted to smartphones. In her \n, psychology professor Jean M Twenge argued there is a potential correlation between the uptake in smartphones among \u201ciGens\u201d (born between 1995 and 2012) and increasing rates of youth depression. She writes of kids who spend holidays \u201changing out\u201d with their friends online, while rarely leaving the bedroom, let alone the home. Her concerns seemed to be shared by those she is speaking for: a \n survey found that 54% of American teens say they spend too much time online.\nRecently, academics and researchers have argued that our fears about the influence of tech on teen wellbeing are overstated and the science inconclusive. Andrew Przybylski, the director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) and Amy Orben, a researcher at the OII and lecturer in psychology at the Queen\u2019s College, University of Oxford, \n: \u201cWhile it is true that some research suggests that young people who report higher social media use show slightly lower levels of wellbeing, most of these findings are unreliable and their conclusions might amount to little more than statistical noise.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the founder of the Stanford Social Media Lab, Jeff Hancock, \n: \u201c\u2026 if you compare the effects of your phone to eating properly or sleeping or smoking, it\u2019s not even close.\u201d\nBut this does not mean we should let tech off the hook so easily. While it\u2019s important to not overstate teen tech addiction, nor assume adolescents are a homogeneous group with replica social media habits, it\u2019s worth being wary of what such widespread devotion to these devices represents.\nThese days, it\u2019s harder for kids to disconnect. It\u2019s one thing to feel exhausted by the jostling for power in the social hierarchies during school hours, it is quite another to go home, retreat to your bedroom, log on to social media and discover there is in fact no end to your day: you weren\u2019t invited to that party, your crush is still flirting with someone else, and the bullying has merely moved online.\nAs every therapist in the world will tell you, we are ineluctably shaped by our childhood years, and a teen with no way of escaping their social paradigm, be it pleasant or destructive, is a person in constant performance mode, or at the very least, steadying themselves for it.\nAdolescence for many (if not all teens) also represents a confusing time of uncertain boundaries and competing identities, one they will need to retreat from, to build internal defences against, to learn how to cope with and survive. This over-exposure to smartphones threatens to rob teens of a vital inner world, and this loss is much harder to measure through studies. After all, the childhood curiosity that is never cultivated is hard to track or trace, as is the person you never became or the interests that failed to evolve because you spent your spare time engaging primarily with a phone.\nIn this sense, you could argue a generation is being denied the means with which to find out who they are, what they love or don\u2019t love, what makes them feel alive. Everything meaningful is realised in that place of disconnection from the social sphere, while meaninglessness swarms online in its infinite iterations.\nDoubtless, the debate between researchers over a link between teen anxiety and smartphones will continue, but there is no denying the transformative effect on society when a significant cohort spends more of their developmental years on their phone than off it, and cannot fathom a pre-smartphone reality.\nPerhaps we need to prioritise \u201calone time\u201d as more than just the preserve of over-committed professionals, but a very human right, one that is as important for teens as it is for exhausted parents.\nIn fact, teens more than anyone need that crucial time spent in solitude, where emotions are processed and the brain powers down; a place to go when the noise of the world drowns you out or you simply want to drown out the world.\n Johanna Leggatt is a Melbourne-based journalist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/uber-profitable-end-of-2020-ceo-dara-khosrawshahi": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/uber-profitable-end-of-2020-ceo-dara-khosrawshahi", "title": "Uber to be profitable by end of 2020, CEO Dara Khosrawshahi says", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:31:42 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Share price soars following announcement</li><li>Ride-sharing firm lost $8.5bn in 2019<br></li></ul><p>Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said on Thursday that the heavily loss-making ride share company expects to be profitable by the end of 2020, news that sent its share price soaring in late trading.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/uber-california-self-driving-vehicles\">Uber to bring back self-driving cars in California for first time since 2018 death</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/06/uber-profitable-end-of-2020-ceo-dara-khosrawshahi\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said on Thursday that the heavily loss-making ride share company expects to be profitable by the end of 2020, news that sent its share price soaring in late trading.\nReleasing its latest quarterly figures, \n announced a loss of $1.1bn for the last three months of 2019, less than analysts had expected, but still bringing losses for the full year to $8.5bn.

Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.\nThe CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PC/XT\u2019s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn\u2019t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for \u00a362.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.\nIn theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today\u2019s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.\n says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn\u2019t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it\u2019s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there\u2019s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.\nOver the years, many commercial systems have sported multiple DVD drives, sometimes with \n or \n to feed in the discs. But most were aimed at large corporations or service providers, and \n at home users.\nMulti-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to \n. Products aimed at the second were \n, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create \u201ccold storage\u201d backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute \n.\nMF Digital\u2019s \n CD/DVD/BD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed \u2013 perhaps still need \u2013 to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.\nI\u2019m not sure if MF Digital\u2019s cheaper \n would do the job because you don\u2019t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect \u00a31,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.\nThat leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn\u2019t manage to find one \u2013 the search terms are tricky \u2013 and the price might still be prohibitive. I\u2019d guess it would cost from 25p to \u00a31 per disk, and 50p doesn\u2019t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost \u00a3500. You\u2019d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.\nIf anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.\nIf there\u2019s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it\u2019s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don\u2019t set a target, you might never finish the job.\nPerhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.\nAlternatively, you could buy one or two \n and plug them into USB ports, or into a powered USB hub. (Not every USB port provides enough power to run a DVD that doesn\u2019t have its own power supply.) With two drives, you can load a DVD in one drive while the other drive is copying files.\nAfter that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.\n has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for \u201cCopy a lot of CD/DVDs automatically\u201d and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It\u2019s a small (219K), free program and doesn\u2019t need to be installed, so it\u2019s worth a try.\nI also tried Averk\u2019s free \n, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you \u2013 he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive \u2013 and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation\u2019s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.\nThe first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don\u2019t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.\nOver the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it\u2019s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I\u2019m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.\nI\u2019m converting some videos that were in less popular formats \u2013 such as wmv, mov, flv and rm \u2013 to mp4 with the H.264 codec, which is supported by processors (Intel \n) and most graphics cards. Programs such as \n make this very easy to do. You can also reprocess old videos to remove colour casts, make them look sharper, correct faulty aspect ratios and \u201cupscale\u201d their resolution, though the results from my old VHS-C video camera will never look good by today\u2019s standards.\nEven DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids\u2019 birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on \n, Amazon Prime, \n, YouTube or some other streaming service.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker", "title": "Google Nest Mini review: better bass and recycled plastic", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 07:00:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>Upgrade keeps what is good and improves sound for Google\u2019s smallest, cheapest smart speaker</p><p>The second generation of Google\u2019s smallest smart speaker gets a new name, more eco-friendly, a little smarter and more bass.</p><p>The \u00a349 Nest Mini replaces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/26/google-home-mini-review-voice-assistant-speaker\">Google Home Mini</a> as part of a revamped and renamed line of Google smart home products under the Nest brand, pushing its predecessor to a clearance price of only \u00a319.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/16/google-nest-mini-review-bass-sound-smart-speaker\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/14/sonos-move-review-brilliant-sound-now-portable": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/14/sonos-move-review-brilliant-sound-now-portable", "title": "Sonos Move review: brilliant sound now portable", "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 07:00:28 GMT", "summary": "<p>Wireless smart speaker with 10-hour battery, room-filling sound, wifi and Bluetooth is not your ordinary portable speaker</p><p>Sonos has finally made a portable wifi and Bluetooth speaker that sounds great \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite what most will have imagined.</p><p>For years Sonos has made some of the very best wifi speakers, recently adding optional voice assistants from Google and Amazon.

While EU rules cap roaming fees outside Europe at \u20ac50, the legislation does not apply to satellite networks on planes and boats, which charge premium rates for data, wanted or not, unless customers actively switch off data roaming.\nSome ferry passengers have been hit when their mobiles connected to the onboard system, even when sailing within the European Union, where data charges must not exceed tariffs customers pay at home.\nEmma Hamilton\u2019s monthly bill from \n almost doubled after a return ferry trip to Ireland, even though she never left EU waters.\n\u201cMy phone activated a rest-of-the-world 24-hour pass, apparently an obscure bolt-on that kicks in when you go outside Europe,\u201d she says. \u201cI reminded the call centre that Ireland and the UK are in Europe but was told it applied anyway.\u201d\nO2 told the \n that customers should turn off data roaming before boarding ferries to prevent them connecting to onboard satellite services.\nAs pressure grows on airlines and ferry operators to provide internet services, an increasing number of passengers face being caught out \u2013 without even touching their phone \u2013 by premium rates set and billed by their home service provider. These can be over \u00a310 per MB, the amount required to browse one web page. They can kick in if a passenger simply takes a single photo.\nExtortionate charges can also stack up if a boat or plane passes close to national borders. \n are configured to pick up the strongest signal and if that happens to come from a country outside the EU, international roaming charges will kick in.\nHaines\u2019s phone signal was automatically relayed from aircraft antenna via satellite to a ground network operated by AeroMobile. The Crawley-based company, a subsidiary of Panasonic Avionics, began offering inflight services in 2008 and 23 airlines have signed up. Airborne users are not automatically sent text messages by their provider detailing charges. Moreover, cabin crew on the Virgin Atlantic flight made no mention of potential charges if passengers fail to heed advice to switch to flight mode. The airline, which offers the service on half of its fleet, acknowledged that while onboard announcements warn of international roaming charges when using AeroMobile, they do not say that those who don\u2019t use it can also be liable. It declined to state the cut it received from the charges.\nHaines\u2019s bill was levied by her company\u2019s service provider, Intercity Technology, which sells phones and services to businesses and uses the \n network.\nIntercity confirmed its inflight service connects automatically, even if the phone is stowed in the overhead locker. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s included in customers\u2019 monthly bill as an over- charge for roaming in a country not covered by their selected tariff.\u201d It insists it alerts customers to unusual charges and, if necessary, suspends data to protect their interests.\nHaines claims she never received an alert. \u201cThe first I knew about it was when my data was cut off when I arrived at Barbados,\u201d she says. \u201cI assumed there had been fraudulent activity. It was only later that Intercity informed me of the reason.\u201d\nIntercity has offered to contribute \u00a3500 towards her bill as a goodwill gesture. It also promised to remind all customers to switch to flight mode.\nAeroMobile says it advises airline clients to announce that roaming charges apply on board. \u201cThe passenger will receive a text from the onboard system telling them they are connected to the mobile service. However, it is their home operator that must communicate the cost.\u201d\nIntercity didn\u2019t respond to requests for its satellite roaming charges. Vodafone, its network provider, charges up to \u00a37.20 per MB of data for airline connections, compared with \u00a36 by Three. BT\u2019s charge is \u00a39.20. All include this in their data roaming and spend cap, so customers have their data cut off after the bill reaches \u00a335, unless they have asked for it to be lifted. EE requires customers to buy an add-on at \u00a336 a day for 5MB. Virgin Mobile says its customers can\u2019t connect to satellite services.\nThe charges can confuse customer service staff as well as customers. When Ali Hines was billed for downloading \u00a343 of data from a Norwegian network while flying home from Indonesia, she was told by O2 that her phone must have picked up a superior signal over the border. Hines pointed out she was 10,000km from Norway at the time of the download and was then told, like Haines, she had inadvertently connected to AeroMobile.\nShe insists her phone was switched off, whereupon O2 reckoned it must have connected while boarding or leaving the aircraft, although the download was three hours after takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019ve since refunded the charge, but there\u2019s nothing to stop this from happening again,\u201d she says.\nO2 confirmed the phone had connected to AeroMobile, which uses a Norwegian mast, and that she should have received a text alert. Its satellite roaming charges are \u00a37.50 per MB.\n\u201cWe are sorry Ms Hines was given incorrect information and have credited \u00a351 to her account,\u201d it says.\nGay Haines, who is still left owing \u00a3600, plans to escalate her complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. \u201cI cannot believe I am the only idiot who forgot to turn their phone to flight,\u201d she said.\n The EU has banned mobile phone providers charging extra fees for users to use their allowance of minutes, texts or (most) data within EU territory. Take care if you are near a border as phones connect to the strongest signal, which could be in a non-EU country.\n Think twice before turning your data-roaming cap off. Providers have to cut you off when you\u2019ve used \u20ac50 under EU rules, unless you ask them to lift the cap. If you do, you risk unlimited bills.\n In the air or at sea, your mobile could connect to a network in a non-EU country or an onboard satellite system on your ship or a nearby ship, in which case EU rules won\u2019t apply. Switch your device into flight mode to avoid this.\n Complain to a dispute resolution scheme. If you feel you were unfairly charged and can\u2019t resolve the issue with your provider, you can take your complaint to the Communications Ombudsman or adjudicator Cisas.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/09/how-do-i-find-a-smartphone-with-the-specifications-i-really-want": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/09/how-do-i-find-a-smartphone-with-the-specifications-i-really-want", "title": "How do I find a smartphone with the specifications I really want?", "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Product search tools help you find a phone, PC or camera if you know the specs you want</p><p>My Samsung S8 has given up the ghost, and the prohibitive cost of repair means I\u2019m in the market for a new mobile phone.

In fact, it\u2019s a problem I share: nobody offers a laptop that meets my most-desired specification, though a few come close.\nThe second problem is that it can be hard work. There are thousands of products with variable specifications, many of them incomplete. The numbers you can find may well be a mixture of inches and centimetres, kilograms and pounds, and binary and decimal bytes. In some cases, I\u2019ve created spreadsheets to compare products, partly to automate the format conversions.\nThe third problem is that choosing purely on specification ignores other important features, such as manufacturing quality, ergonomics, software experience, reliability and support. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to get a \u201chands on\u201d and to read independent reviews, plus the manufacturer\u2019s support forums, if any.\nThere\u2019s always a risk factor, and some technology buyers are more risk-averse than others. Some are happy buying smartphones from little-known suppliers on Chinese websites; others will prefer to buy from a local shop, so they can take it back when they run into a problem.\nThe fourth problem is that most of us have personal preferences. Some people have historical reasons for choosing a particular brand \u2013 they\u2019ve had good or bad experiences with other products from the same company \u2013 or they think it has more social credibility. Maybe they just like the colour or the way it looks. Buyers are often willing to compromise on specifications when less tangible aspects of desirability trigger an emotional response.\nI\u2019m not saying that buying using specifications is wrong: people who ignore them risk buying stupid things. However, specs are not the whole story, and for many buyers, they are not even the main story. Either way, knowing what you value will help you make a more informed choice.\nFrom your wishlist of specifications, you want to buy a dual-sim Android 10 smartphone with at least 8GB of memory, 128GB or more storage (expandable), and a 90Hz or better display. This sort of spec should give you a decent range of options. Unfortunately, you also want a headphone jack, wireless charging and water resistance, which reduces the options to none. The last thing on your wishlist is 5G: \u201cnice to have for future proofing; not required\u201d. That\u2019s a nice thought, but \u201cAndroid\u201d and \u201cfuture proofing\u201d are mutually incompatible.\nI don\u2019t know of any phones that exactly match your wishlist, and I think the long-term trend is the other way. I envisage future smartphones as completely sealed devices with no ports at all. Sims will be \u201cvirtual\u201d \n (stored on the device, instead of physically inserted) and everything else will be done wirelessly.\nHeadphones are on the way out, and microSD card slots \u2013 used to add storage \u2013 will probably go the same way. For now, your spec is mostly practical if you can fit a microSD card into a \n, instead of a second sim.\nIt only took a couple of minutes on \n to come up with what might be your best choice \u2013 the \n \u2013 but you could also consider the \n running Android 9. If you want a 5G phone, the only option is the \n. You can \n. They are all reasonably priced.\nThese mid-range smartphones have the features you want except for wireless charging and the real stumbling block, water resistance. However, you can get both of those from your current supplier in the form of the \n. If you can find dual-sim models with Android 10, the only thing you\u2019d be giving up is the high screen refresh rate, and the rumour is that \n in February.\nOn the whole, then, I think you should stick with Samsung, unless you have totally gone off the company, which would be understandable in the circumstances.\nGSM Arena is really useful if you\u2019re buying a smartphone or a tablet \u2013 the two product categories it covers. If I\u2019m buying something else, I\u2019m often tempted to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the GSM Arena of\u201d cameras or laptops or TV sets or whatever. There is rarely a good answer, but for digital camera buyers, the Amazon-owned DP Review website is excellent.\nLike GSM Arena, DP Review lets you \n and \n. I\u2019ve used these features in earlier answers about digital photography.\nLaptop buyers could really do with their own GSM Arena, but I\u2019ve never found one. However, the \n on the somewhat obscure \n is worth a go. It has sliders to set maximum and minimum values for things like launch date, number of processor cores, power consumption, memory, storage, display size and vertical resolution, battery capacity, estimated battery life, and so on. You can ignore any fields you don\u2019t care about. You can sort the results by value, price, performance or by name, and its rankings seem sensible. Alternatively, you can focus on a particular class of laptop \u2013 the options are Mainstream, Ultraportable, Business, Gaming and CAD/3D modelling \u2013 or on a single brand. Clicking on a laptop brings up its full specification.\nThis \u201claptop search engine\u201d also has a \n and \n. It looks like a labour of love. It solicits donations and has a \n page. One incentive is that donors can get personal laptop buying advice. I hope it survives. Maybe Jeff Bezos should buy it, because Amazon\u2019s laptop search badly needs upgrading.\nThere are, of course, plenty of useful websites such as \n, \n and \n. They all have good reviews and top product picks. However, when it comes to finding laptops that fit a choice of specs, I usually end up using the limited and often clunky filtering features on retail sites such as Currys PC World, eBuyer, Argos, Laptops Direct and so on. The obvious drawback is that they won\u2019t find interesting products that they don\u2019t stock. And those are the ones that someone hunting for a very particular spec may well want to buy.\nGSM Arena is a global website, so some phones may not work in the UK, or wherever you happen to live. There\u2019s less of a risk now the UK has six different 4G bands between 800MHz (the old analogue TV band) and 2.6GHz, but if you\u2019re buying a smartphone from overseas, it\u2019s important to check. Phones sold within the UK should, of course, work with British networks.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked", "title": "Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked", "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 07:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones \u2013 at the best prices right now</p><p>Need a new smartphone but don\u2019t know which one is the very best?

Then I started to get \u201cscreen time\u201d notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.\nWhen I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour; checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I\u2019d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.\nI was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I\u2019d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.\nWhen the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening \u2013 seduced by the allure of shiny new technology \u2013 I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.\nConscious that the Echo wasn\u2019t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine \u2013 a set of Alexa\u2019s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to \u201cstart my day\u201d. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the Guardian\u2019s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.\nIt was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it\u2019s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.\nDiving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the Guardian skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears\u2019s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute\u2019s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.\nMy phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.\nNot only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn\u2019t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn\u2019t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.\nMost notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn\u2019t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.\nIt\u2019s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it\u2019s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you\u2019re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I\u2019ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.\nSurprisingly, given my initial trepidation towards her, I\u2019ve actually grown fond of Alexa. And yes, she has helped me use my phone less; my average screen time is down by 23%. I\u2019m still addicted to Twitter, however, although I\u2019ve found a compromise \u2013 Alexa now tweets for me. The problem is my flatmate now thinks that I talk to myself.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/22/so-i-got-an-amazon-echo-but-can-alexa-get-my-life-together": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/22/so-i-got-an-amazon-echo-but-can-alexa-get-my-life-together", "title": "So I got an Amazon Echo.

Hence, my new co-worker: Amazon\u2019s Echo Show 8 \u2013 an Alexa-enabled device with a screen. I\u2019m having people over for brunch, and this time, I\u2019d like them to not make disparaging comments about the bulging veins in my temples. So I\u2019ll be using Alexa to help me pick the menu, do the shopping, act as a sous chef, pick music, offer dinner party games and help clean up afterwards. Or so I hope.\n\u201cAlexa, can you clean the house for me?\u201d\n\u201cI would if I could, but I can\u2019t \u2013 so I won\u2019t\u201d\nOh well, can\u2019t fault the attitude.\nFirst, I attempt to find a recipe. This is usually a nightmare for me, given that I only cook dishes whose instructions pass my Three Fs test: no food waste, no faff, and no frivolous ingredients; while dried Iranian limes may be a standard-use ingredient for some, I know that any I buy will be used once and then spend a decade decaying at the back of my cupboard.\nIt turns out that all it takes to do away with a painstaking multi-hour process of ploughing through webpage after webpage, is to say: \u201cAlexa, show me brunch recipes.\u201d A BBC Good Food menu pops up and one catches my attention: \u201cTurkish one-pan eggs and peppers.\u201d When I ask Alexa to open it, she tells me that it \u201ctakes 35 minutes to make and has five stars with 79 ratings\u201d. A quick read-through confirms that the trickiest culinary feat required is cracking eggs, and that the most exotic ingredient required is parsley. I\u2019m sold.\nThe next step of my prep is usually even more agonising: shopping. If you wanted to brace yourself for food shortages in a post-Brexit Britain, you could do a lot worse than visit my local supermarket, in which staff automatically respond to casual greetings with: \u201cWe\u2019re out of stock.\u201d This time, however, I say: \u201cAlexa, show me shopping skills\u201d and Morrisons pops up second. I \u201cenable skill\u201d (skills are a bit like apps for Alexa), then all I do is tell Alexa which ingredients to add to my Morrisons shopping basket, log on to the supermarket\u2019s website and select my timeslot. The ingredients arrive shortly afterwards, with nary a surly queue in sight.\nShortly before guests arrive, I decide to set the mood. It\u2019s Sunday, and I\u2019m determined to usher in a new, relaxed and happy era for my reputation as a host. A soundtrack of carefree reggae seems to be the thing. I ask Alexa to \u201cplay reggae\u201d. Bob Marley\u2019s Three Little Birds fires up, accompanied by the lyrics scrolling down screen in gigantic font so that I find myself staring at the words: \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout a thing, \u2018cause every little thing gonna be all right.\u201d It feels a little on the nose, given my aforementioned hosting anxiety.\n\u201cAlexa, you know I\u2019m worried \u2013 don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know that.\u201d\nA likely story.\nAs guests turn up, I prepare a welcome cocktail of a Tom Collins, using an Alexa skill called The Bar. After a few bits of banter-tastic menu navigation (\u201cWelcome to the bar, can I see some ID?\u201d; \u201cTom Collins coming right up!\u201d) I\u2019m given instructions and an ingredient list that let me whip up a long, refreshing citrusy drink.\nI tell Alexa to start reading me the recipe and I follow it step by step, using the Echo Show to set voice-activated timers as I go. By the end of it, I\u2019ve got a shakshuka-like dish of saut\u00e9ed, spicy pepper and tomato sauce encircling baked eggs \u2013 accompanied by a creamy yoghurt topping, punchily packed with parsley and garlic. Unfortunately, there was no setting to stop me mistiming how long to cook an egg for without setting the yolk into a solid yellow disc. But that aside, I\u2019m well chuffed with the results \u2013 and by judiciously spooning the yoghurt on to the top of the egg yolks, the happy murmurs of my guests suggest I\u2019ve gotten away with my overcooking.\nFood over, so it\u2019s time for games. Asking: \u201cAlexa, show me game skills\u201d shows us a menu of 30 options and leads to playing a guess-who game called Akinator, which attempts to tell you which famous character you are thinking about, just by asking a few questions \u2013 we utterly outfox Alexa by selecting Tottenham MP David Lammy. We follow up with Song Quiz \u2013 which plays us clips of tracks from a set genre (we select 90s) and makes us guess artist and song title. Cue impassioned debates about decades-old R&B, cries of \u201cYes!\u201d at the hearing of nostalgic faves and an entirely unfair victimisation of the winner for being a Michael Bolton fan, due to jealousy of his excellent musical knowledge and excellent mixing of Tom Collins cocktails.\nThe gathering ends, guests are happy, and my pulse is unlikely to trouble the emergency services. All in all: a very easy afternoon of entertaining. As my last guest leaves, they quip: \u201cWhat now? You going to get Alexa to start the dishwasher?\u201d\nSigh, if only I had a dishwasher.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/from-sous-chef-to-security-guard-how-the-nation-uses-its-smart-speakers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/from-sous-chef-to-security-guard-how-the-nation-uses-its-smart-speakers", "title": "From sous chef to security guard: how the nation uses its smart speakers", "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2020 11:17:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device.

Even cheap laptops can run \n Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today\u2019s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.\nAny PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.\nEither way, it\u2019s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.\nI don\u2019t want to repeat \n in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the \n is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.\nFor example, you can start with 4GB of memory, a traditional hard drive, a cast-off screen and a cheap printer, and improve the system when you can afford new parts. Most desktops can now handle up to 32GB or more memory \u2013 \n \u2013 and you can replace a slow hard drive with a fast, chip-based \n. You can easily replace the original monitor with a bigger, brighter screen, which you can\u2019t do with a laptop.\nShort of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it\u2019s done.\nMonitors have improved a lot in the past decade. You can now buy them for \n or \n, so that\u2019s what I usually recommend. The corollary is that most older screens are not worth very much second hand, no matter how much they cost when new.\nSecond hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.\nYou may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.\nThanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, \n usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.\nBut the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for \n and 2GB for browser tabs.\nIndeed, given that memory modules are now cheap \u2013 \n \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to use less.\nSSDs have also plunged in price. Today, 120GB drives go for \n, and 240GB drives can be had for \n. It makes no sense to buy a PC with a 32GB drive, and for Windows 10 users even 64GB is no longer enough.\nWhen a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the \n app (remember to click \u201cClean up system files\u201d) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.\nToday, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or \n is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and \u201cpower users\u201d will want, and often need, more.\nPicking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)\nNo one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it\u2019s using without looking it up. Often, differences don\u2019t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.\nBusinesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It\u2019s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it\u2019s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don\u2019t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn\u2019t care. If you\u2019re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won\u2019t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.\nThere\u2019s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of \u201cnormal\u201d.\nSo, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.\nThe good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today\u2019s standards. In response to the market\u2019s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more \n, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a \n of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.\nThere are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip\u2019s score on the \n and compare it with your own PC\u2019s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don\u2019t matter.)\nFor a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.\nLet\u2019s put those PassMark numbers in context. Even a 6W Pentium Silver N5000, designed for thin laptops, manages \n, which is my minimum. My old Core i5-2500 scores \n, while the i5-3470 used in last week\u2019s refurbished \n (\u00a3135) scores \n. The i5-8400 in my current desktop scores \n. A really fast (and pricey) Core i9-9900K scores \n.\nIn general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you\u2019re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons", "title": "Which is the best PC for someone who has Parkinson\u2019s?", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>Richard wants a laptop for its flatter keys, but desktop PCs can have any keyboard type </p><p>I plan to get a new computer for home use, no games.

With a laptop, you are more or less stuck with the keyboard fitted by the manufacturer, and the quality varies from average to mediocre. With a desktop PC, you can take your pick from dozens of USB and Bluetooth keyboards. These range from keyboards with flat, island-style isolated keys to full mechanical keyboards aimed at professionals and gamers.\nSome USB keyboards have \n for children and for grown-ups with vision and other problems. There\u2019s also a programmable membrane keyboard, \n, that doesn\u2019t have keys at all. Helpikeys works with a variety of keyboard overlays, and people can create custom keyboards with its Layout Builder software.\nThere are lots of flat keyboards that might suit you. The wireless Bluetooth options include the \n (\u00a385.76 on Amazon.co.uk) and \n (\u00a371.99) keyboards, plus similar models from \n (\u00a336.99) and \n (\u00a329.99). Personally, I\u2019d go for the silver \n wired USB keyboard (\u00a328.66), though there are cheaper wired options.\nEither way, consider contacting \n, a charity that provides specialist advice on technology to \u201cpeople of any age, living with any disability or impairment\u201d. AbilityNet may also be able to offer you \n through its network of volunteers. It\u2019s a wonderful resource for older people and those with disabilities.\nThere are some good reasons for buying a laptop. The main ones are, first, that you need to use your PC while out and about, or at least in different rooms; and second, that you don\u2019t have room for a desktop monitor and external keyboard.\nSize is no longer a disqualification because you can get tiny \n that will attach to the back of a monitor. However, it\u2019s pretty hard to use a desktop without some sort of desk or table and a chair, and those take up valuable floor space.\nIf you have room for a desktop, there are lots of reasons to buy one. Desktops generally run faster than laptops because they can use faster processors that run hotter. Desktops do not limit your screen size or keyboard quality, so you can optimise the system to your needs. Desktops are easier to expand, update and repair \u2013 you can usually add extra memory, bigger drives and faster graphics cards \u2013 so they should last longer. And if your system is set up correctly, \n, so they are better for your health.\nMost laptops let you plug in an external monitor or screen display, a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, a mouse, headphones, ethernet adapter, and external USB hard drives for backups and extra storage. \n Windows supports multiple displays as standard, so the main problem is picking a cable to connect the second screen to your laptop.\nFor most purposes, we\u2019ve already left behind VGA and DVI connections. Modern TV sets and monitors have HDMI ports, and sometimes others such as DisplayPort. Modern laptops typically have HDMI, DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort connections, and sometimes USB Type C ports.\nIf both devices have HDMI ports, an HDMI cable will do the job. Sometimes you might need an adapter cable such as HDMI-to-DisplayPort, or vice versa. Otherwise, there are cables with VGA, DVI, Mini DisplayPort, DisplayPort or USB-C plugs at one end and HDMI at the other end.\nThere are three problems with this approach. First, your laptop may not have enough ports to plug everything in. Second, it\u2019s tedious to have to unplug all the accessories when you want to take your laptop somewhere, then plug them back in later. Third, you have all the disadvantages of a desktop PC without the advantages.\nIn the early days of business laptops, docking stations alleviated these problems. Accessories \u2013 keyboard, screen, mouse etc \u2013 plugged into the docking station and the laptop docked with that. Dedicated docking stations are still available, but the general-purpose solution is a mini-tower like the \n. Everything plugs into the Plugable, or similar device, so there is only one USB 2 or preferably USB 3 cable to the laptop. There are also USB-C versions that can provide power to the laptop as well as all the various connections.\nYou could take this route if you need a laptop, but it will cost more and not perform as well.\nThe desktop PC is far from being an endangered species, but it has speciated a long way from the \u201cone size fits all\u201d models popular a few decades ago. There are tiny \n 10 PCs for serving media, SFF (small form factor) models for office use, all-in-ones built straight into a screen, high-powered towers for music and video editing, and even more high-powered machines with sci-fi styling and multicoloured lights for gamers. For your purposes, almost any of them would do.\nIf you are on a budget, an acceptable minimum would be something like a Lenovo IdeaCentre 310s with an Intel Pentium J5005 processor, 4GB of memory, DVD and a 1TB hard drive. Currys PC World is selling this PC for \n, and Lenovo offers it online with 8GB for \n. One reason for buying direct is that you can buy three years of on-site support for \u00a348.96.\nHowever, memory is so cheap, I don\u2019t see the point of buying a PC with 4GB of memory, unless you plan to add more. Last year I bought another 8GB (\u00a336) to take my desktop PC up to 16GB.\nYou would also get a much more responsive PC by buying a system with a faster processor, such as an Intel Core i3 or better (ie i5/i7/i9), or the equivalent AMD Ryzen processor and a 128GB or larger \n instead of a traditional hard drive.\nIf you can afford it, go for something like the \n (search for 590-p0057na) with a Ryzen 5 2400G, 8GB of memory, 128GB SSD and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99 at Argos. It\u2019s overkill for your likely needs, but it\u2019s good value. The \n with exactly the same spec costs \u00a3529 at PC World. The \n (who?) version at eBuyer has a 240GB SSD but lacks the 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99. This kind of spec should easily last more than five years.\nLarge businesses still buy desktop PCs in large volumes. They generally want something small, reliable and repairable. These machines are written off after a few years, refurbished, and sold to consumers and some small businesses. One of today\u2019s classic buys is the Dell OptiPlex 7010 SFF (\n), with the HP 8100 Elite SFF among the alternatives.\nOne drawback is that their old Intel Core chips aren\u2019t as good as today\u2019s versions. However, with 8GB of memory and, ideally, an SSD, they should be speedy enough for your purposes.\nThere are dozens of sources of refurbished OptiPlex PCs including \n, \n, \n and numerous Amazon and eBay sellers, though \n.\nTier1Online will add memory and storage, and extend the warranty, for a price, but it\u2019s cheaper to buy a low-end machine and upgrade it yourself. If you can.\nAt the moment, \n has some deals worth exploring. You could get a refurbished OptiPlex 7010 SFF with a Core i5-3470, 8GB, a 250GB hard drive, DVD and Windows 10 Professional for \n, or with a 128GB SSD instead of the hard drive, \n. And \n, despite being five years older.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/16/im-still-on-windows-7-what-should-i-do": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/16/im-still-on-windows-7-what-should-i-do", "title": "I\u2019m still on Windows 7 \u2013 what should I do?", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>Support for Windows 7 has ended, leaving Marcy wondering how they can protect themselves </p><p>I do a lot of work on a Windows 7 desktop PC that is about five years old.

Despite Microsoft\u2019s repeated warnings to Windows 7 users, there may still be \n, many of them in businesses. What should people do next?\nTo begin with, Windows 7 will not stop working, it will just stop receiving security updates. Users will therefore be more vulnerable to malware attacks, particularly from \u201c\n\u201d. We saw how dangerous that can be when WannaCry took over unpatched PCs in \n. It was so bad that \n, even though it was out of support.\nThere are reasons to be fearful, because of the way the malware industry works.\nOn the second Tuesday of every month, \n releases security patches that should be installed automatically by Windows Update. The malware industry analyses these patches to find the holes, and then looks for ways to exploit them. A lot of the code in Windows 10 goes back to Windows 7 and earlier versions. As a result, some of the security holes in Windows 10 will also be present in Windows 7, but they won\u2019t be patched.\n writers don\u2019t normally target out-of-date operating systems, because they don\u2019t usually have many users. In this case, as with XP, there could be millions of relatively easy targets.\nThe British government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \n: \u201cWe would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts.\u201d That\u2019s good advice.\nThe NCSC\u2019s website suggests some \u201c\n\u201d. It\u2019s aimed mainly at government departments and businesses, and isn\u2019t specific to Windows 7.\nThe core advice boils down to this: avoid coming into contact with any malware, and make sure you have nothing to lose. The first is basically impossible in a world where malware can be served via advertisements (\u201cmalvertising\u201d) even on respectable websites. The second is tedious but essential.\nWhile you can\u2019t patch Windows 7, you can \n. That applies to browsers in particular. Fortunately, the main browser suppliers will keep updating them, and \n: \u201cWe will continue to fully support Chrome on Windows 7 for a minimum of 18 months from Microsoft\u2019s end of life date, until at least 15 July 2021.\u201d\nEventually, however, they\u2019ll stop testing their browsers on \n because it\u2019s expensive and will only serve a shrinking number of users.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid malware completely, try to avoid untrusted or insecure websites. Major name-brand websites should be reasonably safe, including your bank\u2019s. Sources of free, pirated or \u201cadult\u201d stuff are generally less so. But, sooner or later, your bank will decide that it\u2019s too risky to deal with people who have vulnerable computers, and prevent you from logging on.\nRunning good anti-virus software and a firewall should help minimise the risk, so it may be worth paying for something like Kaspersky Total Security. However, no security software is foolproof, and it won\u2019t patch your unpatched operating system.\nYou must also be super-suspicious about emails, and never click unsolicited attachments. According to \n, spam and phishing emails caused 67% of ransomware infections in 2019, causing $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) worth of damage.\n and other serious attacks is not having anything to lose. Keep copies of all your valuable data on external hard drives and thumb-drives and possibly online, and as little as possible on your Windows 7 PC. Make daily backups to a storage device that is not otherwise attached to your PC, and keep a current disk image handy. You\u2019ll never have to pay a ransom if you can just wipe the infected drive and restore your PC from a backup.\nGiven the risks of running Windows 7, users should plan to replace it as soon as possible. The options include \n 10, Linux and CloudReady, which is based on Google\u2019s Chromium OS. In effect, it turns your PC into a Chromebook.\nWindows 10 is the best option for most ordinary Windows 7 users. Although it has some additional stuff, Windows 10 still has most of the features of Windows 7, and \n. It will run most, if not all, of your existing software, and you will have to do the least amount of relearning. Decades of Windows experience will still be useful.\nMicrosoft offered Windows 7 users a free in-place upgrade to Windows 10 during the year after its launch, and it would have been sensible to take it. Since then, you have been able to download a copy of Windows 10 and \n. So far, most users who have tried this and entered their Windows 7 product key have had their copy of Windows 10 authenticated. I can\u2019t say whether that will continue to work. However, Microsoft wants people off Windows 7 and on to Windows 10, so it\u2019s worth a go. Just skip the part where it asks for a product key, and leave it for later.\nIf you install Windows 10, you can use it for a month. After that, you will get a \u201cwatermark\u201d on your desktop that says it isn\u2019t authenticated, and Microsoft will nag you to do it. You will also lose personalisation options, so you won\u2019t be able to change the wallpaper, themes, lock screen and so on, but it will continue to work. Using an unauthenticated copy of Windows 10 is not a long-term solution, and it\u2019s a bad idea for businesses, which can \n. However, if you\u2019re a Windows 7 home user, it gives you more time to decide what to do.\nIf Windows 10 runs well on your PC, you might decide to pay to authenticate it. If it doesn\u2019t run well, you can still try a different option, such as \n, \n or \n.\nAlternatively, keep Windows 7 for offline use, and use a \u201clive Linux\u201d for internet access.\nMany people are familiar with the idea of running Linux from a \u201clive CD\u201d or DVD, which doesn\u2019t interfere with the current desktop operating system. There are not many DVD drives around nowadays, so the modern equivalent is to run it from a thumb-drive. You can create one with a tool such as \n or \n. Thumb-drives are slow, so you won\u2019t get great performance, but it will keep you safe online. You\u2019ll also find out if you can live with Linux.\nThe problem with buying Windows 10 Home from the Windows Store is the price: \n. You can buy laptops running Windows 10 for less than that, and usable laptops for not much more. For example, you could get a brand new \n (11.6in screen) from Argos for \u00a3159.99, or a \n (14in screen) for \u00a3179.99. Both have slow Intel Celeron N4000 processors and 4GB of memory, and they are called \u201ccloudbooks\u201d because of their limited 64GB of storage. Like Chromebooks, they are designed to work online. Unlike Chromebooks, they can run Microsoft Office and other Windows programs.\nA better buy would be an \n with a Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3239.99 at eBuyer.\nAlternatively, you could buy a refurbished laptop or desktop already running Windows 10. For example, \n has a small ex-corporate HP desktop with a Core i3-3220 processor, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and one-year guarantee for \n. It has lots of ThinkPad laptops at prices from \n (X240 with an i3-4010U and 4GB) or less to \n (X1 Carbon with an i5-4210U, 8GB and a 128GB SSD) or more. Tier1Online will also add extra memory and SSDs to most of its machines, if required. You can extend the guarantee to three years for \u00a340.\nYou can also buy refurbished laptops from \n and various suppliers on Amazon or eBay. \n is a government-backed scheme that offers extra discounts to people on benefits, and there are \n.\nIf all else fails, you may be able to get a free laptop running Windows 10 from a recycling group such as \n or \n, or from a friend of a friend.\nWindows 7 hasn\u2019t been current since 2012, when Windows 8 was launched. Processors have advanced a lot since then, and SSDs have mostly replaced hard drives. Somebody else\u2019s cast-off PC may be newer and faster than the one you\u2019ve been using for five or 10 years.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search", "title": "How can I get better at using Google search?", "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:43 GMT", "summary": "<p>Michael struggles to find the search results he\u2019s looking for, and would like some tips for better Googling</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy\">Last week\u2019s column</a> mentioned search skills.

Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching \u2013 which is almost everyone \u2013 could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its \n algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn\u2019t deliver what they wanted.\nLater, \n added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else \u2013 or even a machine \u2013 to know.\nWhen talking about avoiding \u201c\n\u201d, former Google boss \n: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you\u2019ve been. We can more or less know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nGoogle hasn\u2019t got to that point, yet, but it does want to save you from typing. Today, Google does this through a combination of \n search suggestions, \n, and \u201c\n\u201d boxes, which show related questions along with their \u201c\n\u201d. As a result, Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research, about \n, and about 6% go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps.\nYou could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links.\nSo, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in \n \u2013 or perhaps not for as long.\nThe easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the \n, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words).\nYou can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it\u2019s a fallback if you forget any.\nHappily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable.\nIf you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results.\nPutting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people\u2019s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases.\nYou can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: \u201cI for one welcome our new insect overlords\u201d. Searching for \u201cI for one welcome our new * overlords\u201d finds other overlords such as aliens, \n, computers, robots and squirrels.\nNowadays, Google\u2019s \n is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include \u201c\n\u201d such as a, at, that, the and this. You don\u2019t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths.\nHowever, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don\u2019t want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car.\nGoogle also has a site: command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or, with a minus sign (-site:), exclude it. This command uses the site\u2019s uniform resource locator or \n.\nFor example, if you wanted to find something on the Guardian\u2019s website, you would type site:theguardian.com (no space after the colon) alongside your search words.\nYou may not need to search the whole site. For example, site:theguardian.com/technology/askjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online, though it doesn\u2019t search all the ancient texts (\n).\nThere are several similar commands. For example, inurl: will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their \n (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle: to find words in titles.\nWeb pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things, including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title, it should be one of the page\u2019s main topics.\nYou can also use site: and inurl: commands to limit searches to include, or exclude, whole groups of websites. For example, either site:co.uk or inurl:co.uk will search matching UK websites, though many UK sites now have .com addresses. Similarly, site:ac.uk and inurl:ac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions, while inurl:edu and site:edu will find American ones. Using inurl:ac.uk OR inurl:edu (the \n must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using site:gov.uk will find British government websites, and inurl:https will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers.\nGoogle Search can also find different types of file, using either filetype: or ext: (for file extension). These include office documents (docx, pptx, xlxs, rtf, odt, odp, odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example, a search for picasso filetype:pdf is more productive than one for stormzy.\nWe often want up-to-date results, particularly in technology where things that used to be true are not true any more. After you have run a search, you can use Google\u2019s time settings to filter the results, or use new search terms. To do this, click Tools, click the down arrow next to \u201cAny time\u201d, and use the dropdown menu to pick a time period between \u201cPast hour\u201d and \u201cPast year\u201d.\nLast week, I was complaining that Google\u2019s \u201cfreshness algorithm\u201d could serve up lots of blog-spam, burying far more useful hits. Depending on the topic, you can use a custom time range to get less fresh but perhaps more useful results.\nCustom time settings are even more useful for finding contemporary coverage of events, which might be \n, a \n, or \n. Human memories are good at rewriting history, but contemporaneous reports can provide a more accurate picture.\nHowever, custom date ranges have disappeared from mobile, the daterange: command no longer seems to work in search boxes, and \u201csort by date\u201d has gone except in news searches. Instead, this year, \n to do the same job. For example, you could search for \u201cApple iPod\u201d before:2002-05-31 after:2001-10-15 for a bit of nostalgia. The date formats are very forgiving, so one day we may all prefer it.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy", "title": "Can DuckDuckGo replace Google search while offering better privacy?", "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>The alternative search engine markets itself on protecting users\u2019 privacy, but is it worth using?</p><p>So is DuckDuckGo no good?

I have suggested this privacy-oriented search engine a few times since 2012, and I think it\u2019s worth a go. However, I\u2019m answering Murray\u2019s earlier query along the same lines because I can use his email verbatim rather than cobbling together a joint question from multiple sources.\nI will admit that Google is generally the best search engine. I was an early adopter and often recommended it. Google was also attractive because its home page wasn\u2019t stuffed with advertising, and because of the company\u2019s old motto: \u201c\n\u201d. This was a bit of a jab at competitors, who were said to be \u201ckind of exploiting the users to some extent\u201d. How times change.\nGoogle\u2019s prowess at search and its success at selling advertising created a virtuous circle. More users and more money led to bigger indexes of web pages, more servers and faster responses, along with better algorithms created by growing numbers of super-smart computer scientists. Adding Gmail, Maps and the Chrome browser reinforced its power. Nobody else could keep up.\n Search soon became one of the web\u2019s category-defining behemoths along with, for example, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, YouTube and Wikipedia.\nDominant web properties can decline dramatically \u2013 it happened to AOL and Yahoo, as \n shows \u2013 but most survive for a long time.\nTheoretically, upstarts can displace incumbents by using new technologies to offer an (initially) inferior but cheaper product to a larger market, as described in Clayton Christensen\u2019s book, \n. This appears to be impossible with Google Search, because its price is zero and its reach is almost unlimited. (Baidu dominates in China and Yandex is popular in Russia.) Google therefore looks impregnable, unless it loses its grip on the advertising market \u2013 no money, no search \u2013 or the US government intervenes.\nBut Google has a weakness, privacy, which DuckDuckGo attacks. Indeed, it describes itself as \u201cthe internet privacy company\u201d where Google is obviously \u201cthe internet advertising company\u201d.\nIt follows through with a Firefox extension, \n, its Privacy Weekly newsletter, a blog at \n, and \n. The blog offers practical advice, which includes suggesting \n.\nGoogle Search is free at the point of use, but the company makes more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) a year from advertising based on tracking and targeting users. DuckDuckGo is therefore undercutting Google \u201con price\u201d by not collecting any information, not storing your searches, and not tracking you across the web. This means it can\u2019t sell personalised advertising, and it can\u2019t deliver personalised search results. Also, governments can\u2019t get your data, because there isn\u2019t any.\nNone the less, DuckDuckGo does have ways to make money, and it is profitable. Mainly, it uses the old idea of selling ads against search queries. If you search for cars, you are likely to see car ads. This is probably how most search engines make most of their money.\nIn \n, DuckDuckGo argues that Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s business models \u201cdon\u2019t need to be this invasive. It is a choice to squeeze every last ounce of profit at the expense of privacy, democracy and society. A choice they don\u2019t have to make. Without all this tracking, I\u2019m confident they would still be among the most profitable companies in the world, and we\u2019d all be better off.\u201d\nGoogle should deliver the best search results because it has the biggest, freshest index of websites and the smartest search algorithms. However, this does not guarantee the best results. DuckDuckGo can compete because, sometimes, less is more.\nPersonalised search is great in theory but can be flawed in reality. For example, if people are wrong about, say, vaccinations or climate change, personalised search could end up reinforcing their misconceptions instead of correcting them. This is known as the \u201c\n\u201d problem.\nAlso, ultimately, it is more profitable for Google\u2019s algorithms to keep users clicking, even if they end up in a swamp of conspiracy theories on crackpot websites. Of which there are many.\nFurther, even the biggest, freshest web index may have drawbacks. Google\u2019s results can be swamped by blogspam \u2013 quick knockoffs of news stories that contain no original thought, and no original reporting. Good quality articles can get buried where hardly anybody will find them.\nGoogle tries to deliver the results most people want, which works because most people are terrible at searching. Even half-baked questions can get impressive results. But if you\u2019re an expert searcher, like me, Google\u2019s algorithms can seem to ignore what you\u2019ve typed in. In these circumstances, using the \u201cverbatim\u201d command forces Google to pay attention to the words in my query. It can make an astonishing difference to the results, but why should I have to do that?\nGoogle\u2019s search results have also been \u201cgamed\u201d for \n or \n reasons, or \n. This year, the \u201c\n\u201d of Game of Thrones Season 8 were \u201c\n\u201d. How far can you trust search results when members of a Reddit forum can manipulate them?\nA \n has been written by its founder, \n, on Quora. I\u2019m assuming you will read this, so I don\u2019t have to devote 1,000 words to describing it. Suffice it to say that DuckDuckGo works exactly how you would expect a search engine to work.\nOf course, you\u2019ll only find out how well DuckDuckGo works for you by trying it. I\u2019ll be amazed if it doesn\u2019t answer more than half your search queries, but if you want a second opinion, you can always send your current search to Google just by putting !g in front of it. No retyping required.\nThe stumbling blocks for me are: (1) DuckDuckGo\u2019s lack of custom date ranges, which both Google and Bing offer; and (2) it doesn\u2019t do reverse image searches, which I use for double-checking pictures posted on Facebook and Twitter.\nDuckDuckGo is a little less convenient than Google in that, as far as I can tell, you can\u2019t see the options for things like image search, maps, news and shopping without first doing a text search. However, you can send queries to other search engines from DuckDuckGo by using \n commands, as mentioned above. For example, starting a search query with !a will search Amazon, !m will search Google Maps, !r will search Reddit and !w will search Wikipedia.\nIf DuckDuckGo\u2019s ancillary searches don\u2019t work well enough for your purposes, don\u2019t go straight back to Google. \n, \n and \n are good alternatives to Google Maps. \n and reverse image searches are better than Google\u2019s. \n is competitive for news. \n is a great \u201ccomputation engine\u201d that can do many things better than Google, as well as many things Google cannot do.\nFinally, if you really don\u2019t like DuckDuckGo\u2019s main search results, there are lots of alternatives. \n, \n, \n and \n are all privacy oriented. Switzerland\u2019s Swisscows can draw \u201csemantic maps\u201d based on filtering results by their contexts (eg Windows OS updates vs windows and doors). France\u2019s Qwant uses the ampersand for the equivalent of bang commands (for example, &a searches Amazon and &w searches Wikipedia). \n and \n are both privacy-respecting metasearch engines, which means they base their results on other search engines. SearX.me is particularly impressive in the options it offers after you have run a search.\nYou will miss a few things if you stop using Google. You will miss far more if you never use anything else.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast", "title": "The rise of facial recognition technology \u2013 podcast", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 03:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the Metropolitan police in London.

In this world, renting literally isn\u2019t an option.\nFor a generation of fans, that stands in stark contrast to real life. The Resolution Foundation, a housing thinktank, reported in 2018 that up to \n, and the number of households privately renting in England \n in the 10 years after 1996, according to the most recent Labour Force Survey. With young people disproportionately more likely to rent than older generations, many have turned to The Sims to decorate a house that feels like their own.\n\u201cRenting means your aesthetics are limited to pieces you can easily take with you and not bigger things like fixtures on the walls, window styles and paint jobs,\u201d says 29-year-old \n, who lives with their parents, a grandparent and a brother. \n\u201cWe also didn\u2019t want to do anything major in case the landlord raised any complaints,\u201d they explain. Howlane has found an outlet in The Sims, where the dream house they\u2019ve built is a modest two-bedroom place with a reasonably sized kitchen and room for some gym equipment. The modesty is touching, and somewhat sad \u2013 in real life, it\u2019s nothing more than a pipe dream.\nRhiannon Williams, 23, has lived in four rented homes over the past five years, all shared. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have others \u2013 especially a landlord \u2013 sharing the decision making, I could try things out and change the space more often,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Sims is definitely a medium I use to build those fantasies, and it\u2019s perfect for the flexibility aspect because it\u2019s so easy to make changes. I can try out a new sofa in moments rather than having two months of emails with my landlord to get approval!\u201d\nWilliams also craves stability, and a home where she can create long-term design plans. \u201cI think my real-life housing situation has affected how I play The Sims,\u201d she continues. \u201cI love the ability to create places that are always there to go back to, and that I can design and change to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d\nAccording to Roxy Wolosenko, a designer on the original game, that\u2019s what the game\u2019s creator, Will Wright, wanted to facilitate. \u201cHe was really interested in exploring how people felt in different kinds of spaces, and what makes people feel comfortable,\u201d she says. The inspiration for the game was the architect and theorist Christopher Alexander, whose 1977 book A Pattern Language sought to teach people the fundaments of home design in an accessible way.\nFor two decades The Sims has offered the joy of design, without the risk of angering a housemate or, worse, a landlord. The game presents a utopian world of home ownership, where everybody starts out with the same opportunities and can progress from a single-bedroom apartment to a vast palatial mansion as long as they put in the effort. It\u2019s no wonder fans have drawn considerable comfort from building homes that truly feel theirs \u2013 even if it is just a fantasy.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing", "title": "And relax \u2026 the joy of video games where you do almost nothing", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:03:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>More and more people are using games like quiet background experiences, requiring minimal attention while they sew, cook or study</p><p>In the recently released game <a href=\"http://coffeetalk.info/\">Coffee Talk</a>, you play a coffee-shop barista who stands at a counter, through long, rainy Seattle nights, making drinks for customers as they tell you about their lives.

Elves tell you about their love lives, insomniac werewolves seek calm and quiet \u2013 you listen and you try to make drinks that will soothe them.\nCoffee Talk comes from a long line of quietly transgressive games that don\u2019t ask much of the player, that defy the popular notion of video games as a hectic, dizzying pursuit where buttons are bashed and the onscreen action is intense and demanding. \n, like music, can sometimes sit in the background, asking for little more than occasional check-ins. In the early 1980s, I loved to travel vast distances in the space simulation game Elite, watching the pixel stars and hollow planets swoop by, perhaps encountering the odd freighter. I\u2019d put the game on in the background while I did my homework.\nLater, PC owners all over the world were transfixed by Myst, the slow, silent puzzle game that had you visiting almost still images of a deserted island, in between spreadsheet chores. The visual novel genre, vastly popular in Japan, requires little more from players than button presses to select conversational options \u2013 playing Steins;Gate, \n or \n is like checking in with a WhatsApp chat, just one with more Japanese high schools, trans-dimensional monsters and interspecies\u2019 dating than usual.\nOpen world games have become hangouts for a lot of players. You can sit on a hill in Minecraft and watch the sun travel across the sky; you can park your car in Grand Theft Auto V and the world moves around you. A few days ago, I tweeted asking friends for the games they treated like quiet background music. Lots of people mentioned gentle life sims such as \n and Stardew Valley, which writer Ria Jenkins told me she plays while watching Love Island; several opted for professional sims such as Euro Truck Simulator and \n, where you just drop in on a job and carry out mundane tasks. Xbox social strategist and streamer Charleyy Hodson talked about the multiplayer game \n: \u201cMy entire family loves checking in once a day, planting some new crops and picking some flowers. Then we come back the next day to check in again.\u201d\nExperimental indie games often fulfil this role as an unobtrusive element in our endlessly partial attention spans. The exploration mode in action adventure Concrete Genie, the road movie-like Jalopy, the letter-writing game Kind Words \u2013 can be checked in on or left running. Guardian contributor and Gadget Show presenter \n plays the Shakespearean comedy game Astrologaster while doing cross stitch, \u201cjust pressing a button every now and then to advance things\u201d.\nFor many people, the arrival of \u201cappointment\u201d games on Facebook and mobile phones \u2013 such as Farmville and Words With Friends, where you check in and out on the experience throughout the day \u2013 provided a gateway to the idea that games don\u2019t have to be all-consuming. At the same time, our modern dual-screen culture of watching TV while browsing a smartphone or tablet device, has prepared for us a mental space in which seemingly competing inputs can be experienced concurrently.\nCoffee Talk is clever in that it holds the player in a transient social space, where people flit in and out, giving us glimpses of other lives, and it provides no time pressures, no long-term goals. You\u2019re just there. You just listen and serve. It feels authentic and lived in, and it is \u2013 as Kris Antoni Hadiputra, founder of Toge Productions, the Indonesian studio behind the game explains:\nVideo games are about interactivity, of course, but interactivity doesn\u2019t have to mean ceaselessly hitting buttons and guiding an on-screen character, vehicle or weapon. Interactivity can mean quietly inhabiting a space, or just checking in on it, and for a few seconds lending our attention to something benign and beguiling.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen", "title": "The Sims at 20: two decades of life, love and reorganising the kitchen", "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:03:10 GMT", "summary": "<p>In The Sims, if you get a job, buy a house and earn more money then happiness will follow.

One thing creator Will Wright realised very early on was that the game was appealing to a large female audience.

A friend\u2019s mother played so much Sims that she forgot to clean the actual house for weeks.\nMortifyingly, some teen pals and I used The Sims 2 to insert ourselves into elaborate Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanfiction. A university classmate created the cast of Friends, and used them to play out a drama that was definitely better than the final season of the show. My own personal obsession with The Sims was so all-consuming that when The Sims 3 arrived in 2009, I had to cut myself off in case I failed my degree. One of my lecturers, spotting The Sims open on my laptop in class, admitted to the worryingly common virtual crime of drowning his Sims in their own pool by deleting the ladders.\nPart of the appeal of video games is control \u2013 not just the act of controlling a character\u2019s actions, but the greater control of understanding a set of rules and systems and bending them to your will. The Sims is so enormously compelling because it offers the fantasy of control over life itself, including all the things that are so maddeningly unpredictable in the real world \u2013 relationships, careers, family, house renovations. The rules of The Sims essentially state that if you work hard and do everything you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 get a job, buy a house, progress through the ranks to earn more money and buy more stuff \u2013 happiness will follow. It\u2019s a beguiling capitalist fantasy \u2013 and even if things aren\u2019t going well, you can always type in the \u201cmotherlode\u201d cheat code to shower yourself in riches.\nIn the 20 years since the original Sims arrived to distract us all from homework and housework (with virtual homework and housework), the series has evolved and expanded, its underlying artificial intelligence code becoming ever more sophisticated. Where originally Sims were miniature automatons, later they developed personalities, aspirations and foibles alongside their basic needs for food, money and toilet facilities. They even developed free will: from The Sims 2 onwards you could flip a switch and the simulation would play out without your input, the Sims making decisions about whom to hook up with and how long to spend in the bath, according to their own virtual whims.\nSome of my favourite times with The Sims have come when the little people are operating independently of me, sometimes so uncannily that it freaked me out. Once, as a teen, I created a replica of my real-life home to see what would happen, and it generated such an accurate facsimile of our family dynamic \u2013 dad yelling at my slobby brother to get off the couch, me arguing with my mum in the kitchen, me writing furiously in a diary late into the night \u2013 that I started to wonder if we weren\u2019t \n. And I wasn\u2019t even a fan of the Simulation Hypothesis. Or high.\nNew games have sent Sims off to college, seen them celebrate birthdays and engagements and new year parties, introduced pets and tiny houses and mermaids. And have you \nwhat Sims fans are doing nowadays? A vast, dedicated community of crafters has made hundreds of thousands of new things to adorn Sim dwellings. Some make an actual living building perfect houses or directing Sims soap operas on YouTube. And of course, they\u2019ve made countless explicit sex mods.\nThe Sims is more than a dolls\u2019 house for the digital generation. In many respects it is a post-literate utopia, powered by love and money. There is no racial prejudice, no gender pay gap. Gay marriage arrived in The Sims years before it did in real life. And as its simulation has become ever more clever, it has let players experiment not simply with home decor and fashions, but with human nature and motivation. Players have used The Sims to explore everything from their own gender identity, to complicated family dynamics, to what would happen if you \n and made them have sex.\nI sometimes wonder what The Sims would be like if it were closer to how real life actually worked \u2013 if it saddled you with crippling university debt, made you pay extortionate rent on a tiny flat instead of letting you build your dream home, had you chasing after people who\u2019ll never love you back and working for years without earning the promotion you deserve. But a more realistic Sims would be depressing to play, because really, the point of The Sims is to make life\u2019s everyday trials, labours and rituals seem fun and full of possibilities. Has a video game ever had a more valuable and worthwhile aim?\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games", "title": "What Pok\u00e9mon can teach us about storytelling", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 07:00:45 GMT", "summary": "<p>Since 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon games have exerted a fascination for fans, telling imaginative stories and encouraging a generation of players to question everything they see</p><p>\u201cThis is it?

My boyfriend, who has never played Pok\u00e9mon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so \u2026\n.\u201d\nI consider, for the first time, what the \n games look like to a person who has never played them. They \n slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The \u201cbattles\u201d you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the \u201cmoves\u201d? You see very little of them. Rattata uses \u201ctackle\u201d and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.\nWhy have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pok\u00e9mon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Pok\u00e9mon, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The guilt you feel when it\u2019s time to bench your Pidgeot \u2013 the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 \u2013 because you know he can\u2019t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. \nThe game encourages you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style \u201cFind the princess!\u201d prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.\nOne visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pok\u00e9mon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pok\u00e9mon \u201cfaint\u201d if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we\u2019ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pok\u00e9mon die and they are mourned.\nThat\u2019s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: \u201cGhosts appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Tower. I think they\u2019re the spirits of Pok\u00e9mon that the Rockets killed.\u201d\nSo Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of \n and \n, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. \nTake the gym leaders. These are the game\u2019s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock\u2019s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge\u2019s deranged Electric-type gym you\u2019re forced to sort through trash before he\u2019ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate \u2013 do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that\u2019s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it\u2019s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pok\u00e9mon.\nFrom the beginning, Pok\u00e9mon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave \n about the mysterious and elusive Pok\u00e9mon named Mew, which was added to Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. \u201cThere were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,\u201d Tajiri explained. \u201cIt created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there \u2026 It kept the interest alive.\u201d\nFor decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player; for years, many players believed that Mew was \n.\nThe sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly guardians, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric \n, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn\u2019t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pok\u00e9mon who are willing to fight for you \u2013 it all makes sense.\nAs a novelist, I\u2019m keenly aware that people won\u2019t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience; it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pok\u00e9mon games, if I weren\u2019t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: \u201cI like shorts. They\u2019re comfy and easy to wear.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll understand.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime", "title": "Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore review \u2013 an enchanting world of wannabe idols", "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 07:00:18 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Switch; Atlus/Nintendo</strong><br>A group of magical youngsters do battle on the streets of Tokyo in this endearing, addictive anime-like role-playing game</p><p>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore is an unlikely candidate for mainstream success in the western market.

The Italian\u2019s latest three came on a testing afternoon against Crystal Palace and elevated Everton, in the relegation zone when Silva was sacked in December, to seventh.\nBernard, on his 50th \n appearance, Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that improved Everton\u2019s return to 17 points in eight league games under their new manager. Silva managed to produce 14 from 15 matches before his necessary dismissal.\nFor Roy Hodgson, however, the misery continues. Palace posed several problems throughout, Christian Benteke was finally and deservedly on the scoresheet, but they were easily punished once again.\nPalace started brighter, denying \n time to settle with intense pressing and sharp passing, only to suffer the fate that befalls so many struggling teams when conceding from their opponents\u2019 first meaningful attack. Ancelotti had been visibly irritated by his team\u2019s passive opening but the quality of their unexpected breakthrough lifted the entire mood inside Goodison. Bernard took the applause for a fine finish but Theo Walcott merited as much credit for his work in the buildup.\nWalcott came into the contest on a high following last weekend\u2019s late winner at Watford. The confidence showed when he received Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s pass on the right, broke clear of Patrick van Aanholt with a quick change of feet and whipped over a superb cross into the heart of the Palace penalty area. Bernard, arriving unmarked behind Calvert-Lewin, swept an emphatic volley beyond Vicente Guaita.\nIt was the 50th Premier League assist of Walcott\u2019s career but also his last contribution of the game. The in-form winger pulled up with a hamstring injury shortly afterwards and was eventually replaced by Djibril Sidib\u00e9. Eventually, as Sidib\u00e9 had forgotten to put on his left sock before coming off the bench. One job Djibril, one job. The glares he received from Ancelotti and Duncan Ferguson for delaying the substitution while Everton continued with 10 men were something to behold.\nHodgson\u2019s team, confidence fragile after a worrying run of three wins in their last 17 league games, were briefly deflated. Everton could not capitalise as their opponents struggled to regroup and aided Palace\u2019s recovery with unconvincing defending and errant passing. Van Aanholt struck a post through a crowd of blue shirts minutes before Bernard\u2019s breakthrough and Wilfried Zaha almost broke in behind Lucas Digne as the visitors regained momentum before the interval. Jordan Pickford saved well at Zaha\u2019s feet and the winger\u2019s appeals for a penalty against S\u00e9amus Coleman in the resulting scramble were rightly dismissed.\nPalace again started strongly after the restart and this time they found reward. Pickford was off his line quickly and bravely to prevent James McArthur equalising early in the second half after Everton defenders had squandered several opportunities to clear inside their area. There was no escape from Palace\u2019s next attack, nor any hiding place for the England goalkeeper after Benteke levelled with his first goal since April and first from open play for two years. The Belgium international easily beat the recalled Michael Keane to a header before setting off for the Everton area. Zaha played a perfectly weighted ball into the path of the former Liverpool striker who drove low and hard past Digne plus Pickford\u2019s weak guard. The goalkeeper had both hands behind the shot but it sailed under him at the near post.\nThe visitors almost took the lead when Richarlison headed a Van Aanholt corner against his own crossbar. Instead they were punished by the Brazilian when he restored Everton\u2019s lead in devastating style. Richarlison was played into space down the left by Calvert-Lewin but still had plenty to do before troubling Guaita in the Palace goal. He made the task look simple, attacking Gary Cahill at pace and cutting inside the back-tracking defender before finding the far corner with a precision strike.\nPickford atoned for his error when he denied Benteke what appeared a certain second with a point-blank save from the striker\u2019s powerful header. A key save.\nEverton were rarely disturbed again. Sigurdsson was close to scoring a superb individual goal after waltzing past several Palace defenders only for Guaita to save. With two minutes remaining Calvert-Lewin confirmed victory when he converted from two yards out after Richarlison\u2019s towering header from Digne\u2019s corner struck the bar.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/08/horse-racing-newbury-altior-game-spirit-champion-chase-cheltenham": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/08/horse-racing-newbury-altior-game-spirit-champion-chase-cheltenham", "title": "Altior\u2019s finishing speed takes Newbury victory and sets up Cheltenham date", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 14:48:08 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Nicky Henderson\u2019s two-mile chaser returned to winning ways<br />\u2022 Altior will go for his third successive Champion Chase<p>After a brief moment of vulnerability, Altior asserted himself to be a comfortable winner of the Game Spirit Chase here and reassure his supporters on his way to next month\u2019s Cheltenham Festival.</p><p>Nico de Boinville had to push him along between the final two fences but the veteran chaser, returned to two miles, responded well on the run-in to score by three lengths over Sceau Royal.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/08/horse-racing-newbury-altior-game-spirit-champion-chase-cheltenham\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "After a brief moment of vulnerability, Altior asserted himself to be a comfortable winner of the Game Spirit Chase here and reassure his supporters on his way to next month\u2019s Cheltenham Festival.\nNico de Boinville had to push him along between the final two fences but the veteran chaser, returned to two miles, responded well on the run-in to score by three lengths over Sceau Royal.\nThere was an early scare when Bun Doran, setting the pace, fell at the water jump. Altior had inches to spare but was not obstructed by the faller, who rose to his feet apparently unharmed, and the pace was set thereafter by Dynamite Dollars, seen as the main pre-race danger.\nBriefly, Altior traded at almost even money on Betfair when it seemed as though he might be in trouble late in the race but that proved to be nothing more than his usual \u2018flat spot\u2019. He was returned as the 1-3 favourite and was shortened by several firms for next month\u2019s Champion Chase, with only bits of 11-4 still available. While Altior ran to a very high standard when chasing home Cyrname at Ascot in November, that first defeat over obstacles was bound to shake the confidence of his followers and perhaps even those closest to him. Though there was little doubt that he retained all his ability, this was his first success since Sandown\u2019s Celebration Chase 10 months ago, as he was prevented from running over Christmas by an abscess.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve still got more improvement to come,\u201d De Boinville told ITV Racing moments after this win. \u201cHis turn of foot from the last to the line was devastating.

The former Test opening batsman played 68 matches for Pakistan, the last being a 2015 World Cup match against the UAE in New Zealand.\n\u201cUsing an undercover officer, NCA investigators identified that the group were plotting to fix elements of the 2016 Bangladesh Premier League T20 tournament which Jamshed was due to play in,\u201d NCA said in its statement.\nThe following year, Anwar was captured on CCTV in St Albans, purchasing 28 different coloured bat handle grips which would subsequently be used by the players in the PSL as the signal to show any potential fixing was going ahead, it added.\n\u201cThese men abused their privileged access to professional, international cricket to corrupt games, eroding public confidence for their own financial gain,\u201d NCA senior investigating officer Ian McConnell said.\nJamshed\u2019s wife, Dr Samara Afzal, wrote on Twitter: \u201cToday is the most difficult day of my life \u2026 I\u2019ve felt the need to write this in the hope that others learn from Nasir\u2019s mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cNasir could have had a bright future, had he worked hard and been committed to the sport than gave him so much, but he took a short cut and lost everything, his career, status, respect and freedom,\u201d Samara added.\n\u201cHe would have got UK nationality and played county cricket, and he threw his chance away. He would do anything to turn the clock back and not lose everything. I hope all cricketers look at his example as a deterrent against corruption.\u201d\nThe Pakistan \n Board slapped batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif with five-year bans last year, while paceman Mohammad Irfan and all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz received shorter suspensions for their roles in the scandal.\nIn 2011, Pakistan cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir \n for their role in a plot to bowl pre-arranged no-balls during a Lord\u2019s test against England in 2010.

Philippe\u2019s polished 52 lifted Sydney to 5-116 from 12 overs, a tricky target that quickly became monumentally challenging for the Stars.\nMelbourne lost their two best batsmen in the opening three overs as they crashed to 3-18. Marcus Stoinis picked out Sean Abbott in the deep after a bright start to the first over, delivered by Nathan Lyon, while Steve O\u2019Keefe trapped Glenn Maxwell lbw.\nMaxwell\u2019s dismissal proved fatal for the Stars, who were always fighting a losing battle despite Nick Larkin\u2019s 38 not out.

Smith produced arguably the shot of the night, heaving a full delivery from Haris Rauf over the leg-side rope and into the crowd, before holing out to Peter Handscomb in the deep off Maxwell.\nSmith\u2019s dismissal ignited a mini-collapse, with Daniel Hughes and Moises Henriques out for seven runs between them, before Philippe regained momentum and brought up his half-century in the final over with a six.

That\u2019s how Vickii Cornborough and Shaunagh Brown prepared for last Sunday\u2019s \n. \u201cEverybody else went out to a restaurant, but me and Shaunagh thought we should just have a night in and cook our own food,\u201d Cornborough says. \u201cWe watched the impeachment trial.\u201d Brown says. \u201cIt was a great evening.\u201d\nIn the shadows of the Pyrenees in Pau, south-western France, Cornborough entered the field as a 48th-minute replacement to win her 50th England cap. The prop, named in the starting XV for Sunday\u2019s meeting with Scotland, reflects on the milestone after a gruelling training session of almost two hours.\n\u201cGoing into France I geed myself up so much that it was just the same as every other game and I didn\u2019t expect there to be much fuss over it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the support was overwhelming.\u201d\nA proud day for the Cornborough family, but were they there to witness it? \u201cNo, my parents are retired and they spend half the year abroad so they were on holiday in Spain,\u201d says Cornborough with a laugh. \u201cBut when I arrived home on Monday, the house was dark and as I opened the door all of my friends and family were there for a surprise party.\u201d\nEngland became the first international women\u2019s team to \n in January 2019, with 28 players signed up, which has had a significant impact on Cornborough and her teammates. \u201cI thought it would forever be a pipe dream for rugby to be my full-time job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI was always told rugby is for fun but go out and get another job. For me to live in that dream and see the next generation of kids coming through and how it can be your career is unbelievable, it gives me goose bumps. It\u2019s provided stability so I can focus the majority of my time and effort in rugby.\u201d\nCornborough missed the autumn internationals because of injury but appreciates how the contract has helped her recovery. \u201cFor my mental health and sanity, it was such a good thing for me to be able to be around my teammates. I was working every day rehabbing and the resources I had access to \u2013 doctors, physios, a full-time strength and conditioning coach who guided every session. I wouldn\u2019t have had that or been able to put that amount of effort in if I wasn\u2019t full-time.\u201d\nCornborough and Brown reflect a jovial atmosphere within the squad, regularly joking together. All players share rooms, however Cornborough is a \u201cnomad\u201d, meaning she does not have a regular roommate, yet they are eager to avoid one teammate in particular. \u201cNobody wants to be with Rowena Burnfield,\u201d says Cornborough with a laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s a snorer and consequently has her own room sometimes,\u201d says Brown.\nApart from impeachment trials, players relax by playing the Nintendo Switch, but despite being a champion rugby player, Cornborough\u2019s performances are substandard. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing with your mum, she\u2019s like an old lady,\u201d says Brown.\nCornborough retorts: \u201cI\u2019m always last but it was canoeing the other day and it\u2019s knackering, you\u2019re trying to canoe as fast as possible and then you\u2019ve got to do it in time. It\u2019s so stressful and I\u2019m not very good at not being good at something.\u201d\nCornborough still works as an IT business development manager around her rugby schedule and sees similarities between the jobs. \u201cFrom work into rugby I bring my organisational skills, determination and ability to lead,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom rugby into work it\u2019s the ability to work in a team. It\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t think people naturally do well in if they\u2019re not from a sporting background. Success on the pitch is scoring points and closing out games and for business it\u2019s closing deals. This is the same thing, just different objectives.\u201d\nDates for the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand were announced this week and Cornborough is thrilled. \u201cTo prep for the World Cup full-time will be amazing. 2017\u2019s tournament had some of my biggest highs and lows. I don\u2019t think I will ever get over \n.\u201d\nBefore then Cornborough will marry her fiance, Will, who proposed in August. He plays for Havant as a flanker and the pair met when they joined the same team as youngsters. It then took another 10 years before encountering each other again in a bar. The wedding, which Cornborough jokes Brown is yet to RSVP to, includes guests from 10 rugby teams.\n\u201cI had to ring up the England coaches to go: \u2018Excuse me, I\u2019d like to get married this summer can we have a look at the calendar, what day can I get married please?\u2019\u201d says Cornborough. \u201cAnd then I called Will and went: \u2018Right, I\u2019ve got a date.\u2019\u201d\nCornborough is clearly a well\u2011respected member of the squad and someone Brown admires. \u201cShe\u2019s an inspiration,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s such an honour to play alongside her, everything she does is for the team. She is one of, if not the best, looseheads in the world.\u201d\nKaty Daly-McLean, scorer of more than 500 England points, agrees: \u201cTo get 50 caps as a prop is sensational.\u201d\nCornborough is humble despite Scotland not beating England since 1998 and last year being on the receiving end of an \n by the Red Roses. \u201cThere are loads of threats in Scotland\u2019s team we must be mindful of and we need to play to our strengths to overcome those,\u201d she says. \u201cThe level of all the teams is up. It\u2019s going to be a difficult rest of the competition, so all bets are on. I\u2019ve still got so many more things I want to achieve in an England shirt and I\u2019m nowhere near done yet.\u201d\nScotland v England\nSS Action; BBC Alba\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/bayern-munich-rb-leipzig-bundesliga-celebrity-barber-controversy": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/bayern-munich-rb-leipzig-bundesliga-celebrity-barber-controversy", "title": "RB Leipzig hope to cut short Bayern\u2019s brush with Bundesliga supremacy", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 12:00:36 GMT", "summary": "Top two meet with Leipzig looking to put criticism over visit of a celebrity barber on eve of a tame defeat behind them<p>Ralf Rangnick was not impressed.

The day before RB Leipzig\u2019s \n game against Eintracht Frankfurt on 25 January, the celebrity barber Sheldon Edwards, aka HD Cutz, had been flown in to the team hotel to cut nine of the players\u2019 hair. Leipzig promptly lost 2-0.\nRangnick, who is head of sport and development at Red Bull in New York these days and a former coach of RB Leipzig, was perplexed. \u201cIf someone had asked me on Sunday, which of the 12 teams who played on Saturday had flown in a barber I would have put quite a lot of money on \n,\u201d he told \n. \u201cIf I am honest I am pretty stunned by this, because from a barber in the team hotel to a gold steak, the step is not too far.\u201d\nThe comment about the gold steak was a reference to Franck Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s visit to Dubai in January 2019. But this was not a dig at the former Bayern player: the barb was directed completely at the Leipzig players.\nThe team were top of the Bundesliga going into the game against Frankfurt but defeat meant \n leapfrogged them. The two teams face each other in a mouthwatering game at the Allianz Arena on Sunday and the feeling is that Leipzig have to get something from this game or the Bayern machine will just do what it has done in the past seven seasons: go on to win the title.\nLeipzig\u2019s current coach, Julian Nagelsmann, was not too hard on the players after the Frankfurt game but \n. \u201cWe are perhaps just beneath the summit at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the question now is: do we want to reach the summit? Or do we stay where we are, have a bit of food, a bit of drink and then start our descent?\u201d\n\u201cI am not talking just about matches, because [against Frankfurt] they were totally engaged. But this is about training as well. We don\u2019t have that much training time and I find that we sometimes are not, by any means, engaged enough.\n\u201cOn Wednesday, for example, the decision was: \u2018This is quite good what we have done so far\u2019. The decision was not: \u2018I am going to go out there, burn [for the cause] and become German champions\u2019.\u201d\nNagelsmann is a fascinating character. Still only 32, he demands absolutely everything from his players. They are not in great form going in to the game against Bayern, with the defeat in Frankfurt followed up by a point rescued in the 89th minute at home against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach last Saturday in the league, before a 3-1 defeat at Frankfurt in the German Cup on Tuesday.\nBayern, on the other hand, are flying under Hansi Flick, who took over from Niko Kovac in November. The Bavarians have won eight of their past 10 games and go into Sunday\u2019s showdown as clear favourites.\nThe contest may well be decided by two prolific strikers: Bayern\u2019s Robert Lewandowski and Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner. Both are in great form, Lewandowski edging Werner in the race for top scorer, the Pole having 22 goals in 20 games with the German two behind. In third place is Borussia Dortmund\u2019s English winger Jadon Sancho, on 12 goals.\nThe 23-year-old Werner has long been rumoured to be on his way to Bayern but Flick was reluctant to talk about the Leipzig forward. \u201cA lot can happen in life,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing at Leipzig, I\u2019m not thinking about him. He is a really good player but at the moment I can only think about Robert Lewandowski. He is the best striker for me. He is in top shape and we are very happy to have him in our squad. He leads our team from the front and has a quality in front of goal that I have rarely seen.\u201d\nWhatever happens on Sunday, the game is unlikely to end goalless. The teams have scored 111 goals in their 40 league games this season. Bayern\u2019s 58 is the joint-highest number of goals scored after 20 league games in Bundesliga history, a record shared with Werder Bremen\u2019s 1985-86 title challengers.\nThose 111 goals are split among 26 different players, 13 from each club. Of the nine players who saw HD Cutz for a trim last season, four have been on the scoresheet in the league this campaign. As for the number of players who will see a celebrity barber on the eve of this game, Nagelsmann can only hope that is zero. From now on, it is all about the football.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/return-of-adel-taarabt-reinvented-himself-at-benfica-qpr": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/return-of-adel-taarabt-reinvented-himself-at-benfica-qpr", "title": "Return of Taarabt: how Adel reinvented himself at Benfica", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:11:11 GMT", "summary": "<p>After four years on the sidelines, the Moroccan is now a snarling defensive midfielder and a key man for the derby with Porto</p><p>Adel Taarabt has been called many things.

I am not this type of player.\u201d\nExcept, this season for Benfica, that is exactly the type of player Taarabt has become and at the age of 30, he is playing the best football of his life \u2013 an all-action combative menace at the base of midfield: snapping into challenges, shouting and ordering his team-mates this way and that, and yes, \n.\nSome old tricks remain, but Taarabt\u2019s transformation is a remarkable one. It has not happened overnight: signed by Benfica in 2015, it took him nearly four years to make a first-team appearance for the Portuguese giants. During the first year of his five-year contract, grainy videos circulated of him turning out for the reserves, punting corner kicks \n. An 18-month loan to Genoa followed, during which Taarabt admitted he had lost 11kg of weight. Another season in Benfica\u2019s reserves came and went before he finally managed to break into the first team in 2019.\nThere is not one single reason why Taarabt has fallen back in love with football, and why football has fallen back in love with him, but his loan spell at Genoa in 2017-18, and his relationship with Ivan Juric, his manager there, is one of the most important. \u201cWhen I first arrived at Genoa, I was out of shape and there were problems\u201d said Taarabt. \u201cI am coming back now, not quite what I was before, but I\u2019m getting there. With Ivan, you always have to go full pelt. He\u2019s fair, though. If you prove that you understood what went wrong, he\u2019ll press the reset button and start again. I don\u2019t know if we can call each other friends, but he certainly changed my life \u2013 and my body.\u201d\nThe Moroccan\u2019s relationships with his various managers have defined the peaks and troughs of his career. Neil Warnock was the first to fully nurture his extraordinary talent. Taarabt went from Spurs cast-off to \n captain in a few months at just 21 years old, was made to feel what he is \u2013 a star \u2013 and spent most of 2010-11 waltzing around the Championship like he owned the place, which he did.\nThose at Loftus Road would simply sing \u201cTaarabt\u2019s too good for you\u201d, which he was. At the end of one performance \u2013 \n \u2013 Warnock can be seen with his hands on his head in disbelief at Taarabt\u2019s performance, not unlike \n with referee Craig Pawson last year. \n was probably the goal of the season, while one \n to set up the winner against Coventry, was surely the best pass Loftus Road had seen since \n against Leicester in 1977. QPR were promoted as champions in May 2011, with Taarabt finishing with 19 goals and 16 assists from 44 league appearances.\nThe clips for Benfica these days are perhaps not as extraterrestrial, but arguably more impressive given that Taarabt is now playing in Champions League, not the Championship. Domestically, Benfica are currently top of the table, having won 18 of their 19 games, and face their only conquerors this season, Porto, on Saturday at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. It is a monumental match between the two biggest rivals in Portugal, and even at this stage, probably represents Porto\u2019s last chance to deny \n a sixth title in seven seasons.\nTaarabt\u2019s contribution will likely be crucial to Benfica\u2019s chances. He scored and was man-of-the-match in their last league game against Belenenses, a narrow 3-2 win, and has formed an excellent understanding alongside Julian Weigl, the \u00a318m January recruit from Borussia Dortmund.\nJust as Warnock nurtured at QPR, and Clarence Seedorf supported Taarabt during his successful loan spell at Milan in 2014, the encouragement from Bruno Lage at Benfica has been pivotal to Taarabt re-establishing himself. \u201cWe tried to place him as second striker, but we felt that we could take more advantage of him in the double pivot,\u201d the head coach said recently. \u201cHe gives us defensive balance and also quality in attack.\u201d\nFew have known the ups and downs that Taarabt has experienced: lurching from cult hero to Karl Henry\u2019s back-up at QPR, keeping Robinho out of the side at Milan before weight gain, obscurity and now redemption at Benfica. There will always be the nagging feeling that Taarabt could have achieved more, but with the arrival of Saturday night\u2019s O Cl\u00e1ssico, we should just enjoy him for what he is: a street footballer trying to fit in on the big stage.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/saracens-champions-cup-expulsion-ineligible-player-misconduct-hearing-rugby-union": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/saracens-champions-cup-expulsion-ineligible-player-misconduct-hearing-rugby-union", "title": "Saracens escape Champions Cup expulsion over fielding ineligible player", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 23:11:43 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Club given \u20ac50,000 fine for playing Titi Lamositele last month</li><li>Champions will play Leinster in April quarter-final</li></ul><p>Saracens have escaped explusion from the Champions Cup but have been fined \u00a342,400 (\u20ac50,000) for fielding an ineligible player, prop Titi Lamositele, in against Racing 92 last month.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/saracens-docked-70-points-chief-executive-resigns\">Saracens docked a further 70 points and chief executive resigns</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/saracens-champions-cup-expulsion-ineligible-player-misconduct-hearing-rugby-union\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Saracens have escaped explusion from the \n but have been fined \u00a342,400 (\u20ac50,000) for fielding an ineligible player, prop Titi Lamositele, in against Racing 92 last month.\nThe troubled English club could have been thrown out of European competition after it emerged that United States international Lamositele\u2019s work permit expired the day before \n over the French side but an independent disciplinary hearing in London on Friday night decided that a financial penalty was sufficient.\nHalf of the fine \u2013 \u20ac25,000 \u2013 will be suspended until the end of the 2020/21 season in a further boost to the Premiership club. \n finished second in their Champions Cup group last month to secure an away quarter-final at Leinster on 4 April.

The witness said he saw the helicopter for one to two seconds before it hit the hill. \nThe helicopter\u2019s instrument panel was destroyed in the crash and most of the devices were displaced, according to the NTSB\u2019s investigative update. The flight controls were broken and suffered fire damage. \nInvestigators believe that since a tree branch at the crash site was cut, it appears the engines were working and rotors turning at the time of impact. \nFriday\u2019s report was merely informational and did not offer any findings about what caused the crash.

The forecast for the final game in Johannesburg on Sunday is also stormy.\nIt promises to be a similarly make-do affair in any case, as Eoin Morgan talked openly after this game about not going out to win the series but instead using it to find out more about his players. \u201cIt won\u2019t be about picking the strongest team,\u201d Morgan said.\nThis seems understandable from an England point of view. But in isolation it is a fairly startling admission at any level of sport and presumably not one that was included in the pre-series marketing. Morgan also spoke about the \u201cgreat energy\u201d Ben Stokes has been injecting behind the scenes. Which is no doubt a great thing for the England team but not so much for the paying spectators of Kingsmead.\nThe truncated day made for a frustrating tableau on a white-ball tour that still feels as though it has barely revved out of second gear. England picked an unchanged team in Durban, a chance for those who were easily cuffed aside in Cape Town to reassert their credentials. South Africa brought in the left-arm spinner Bjorn Fortuin to make his debut in place of Lungi Ngidi, another step in the host nation\u2019s own ongoing rebuild.\nEngland won the toss and bowled on a pitch that was miraculously fit to play despite the torrential gusts of water pouring from the skies before the start. Morgan had spoken about the need to create pressure in the field despite coming here armed with a depleted bowling attack.\nEngland opened up again with Chris Woakes, bowling to two slips in conditions that seemed tailored to his best snaking length with the new ball. His first ball was a zinger that seamed past Quinton de Kock\u2019s outside edge. After which Woakes bowled a little straight to both left- and right-handers.\nFrom the other end Sam Curran began with a 78mph wide and was then pulled and driven to the fence with elegant ease by Reeza Hendricks. Curran is at his most effective bowling with the new ball, England insist. But how effective is that? What level of effectiveness are we talking here?\nJoe Root came on first change and almost immediately removed De Kock with a ball that rushed on and drew a half-and-half prod. Root had been grabbing the ball and sprinting back to his mark. Certainly De Kock seemed only half switched on as the ball pinged back his leg stump. \u201cJoe\u2019s an underrated bowler,\u201d Morgan pointed out at the end.\nHendricks played with some fluency at the other end but the rain returned with South Africa on 38 for one after 6.3 overs. Five hours later the players were back out in hope of completing the reduced game. There was a brief sparkle of action. Tom Curran resumed from the Friendship Pavilion end and saw his fourth ball swung high over midwicket for six by Temba Bavuma to the whoops and cheers of a grateful, scattered crowd.\nThe final act before the players were off again was the dismissal of Bavuma, lbw on review to a ball from Chris Jordan that he tried to pull. Not much has gone emphatically right for England in this series to date. But Jordan has dismissed Bavuma twice in the space of 12 balls, both lbw. After a brief hokey-cokey the rains returned with a vengeance and the day was done. England will hope for a shift of pressure in Johannesburg.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/england-rugby-six-nations-scotland-jonny-may-murrayfield": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/england-rugby-six-nations-scotland-jonny-may-murrayfield", "title": "John Mitchell insists England will be ready for chaos in Scotland showdown", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 22:00:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 England bidding to win Calcutta Cup for first time since 2017<br>\u2022 Storm Ciara adds unpredictability to Murrayfield clash</p><p>England are bracing themselves for chaos on and off the pitch as they seek to breathe life into their Six Nations campaign and reclaim the Calcutta Cup on Saturday.</p><p>The defence coach, John Mitchell, sounded the warning that England will be \u201cready for anything\u201d as they attempt to defeat Scotland for the first time in three years but the potential distractions continued to mount on Friday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/england-rugby-six-nations-scotland-jonny-may-murrayfield\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "England are bracing themselves for chaos on and off the pitch as they seek to breathe life into their \n campaign and reclaim the Calcutta Cup on Saturday.\nThe defence coach, John Mitchell, sounded the warning that England will be \u201cready for anything\u201d as they attempt to defeat Scotland for the first time in three years but the potential distractions continued to mount on Friday.\nThe UK\u2019s strongest storm since 2012 is due to hit Edinburgh on Saturday afternoon while on Friday it emerged the European Champions Cup organisers were investigating Saracens for fielding an ineligible player and held a disciplinary hearing on Friday night. Ultimately it was decided that Saracens would be fined 50,000 euros rather than thrown out of the competition but, with six of the club\u2019s players in the England XV and another on the bench, it was hardly ideal preparation on the eve of a match Jones\u2019s side must win to keep their championship hopes alive.\nEddie Jones\u2019s side were already anticipating a rough ride at Murrayfield with the England head coach describing Scotland as a \u201cniggly, goading\u201d side and memories of a fracas in the tunnel in 2018 still fresh. Going back further, a group of bagpipers blocked the way to the England dressing room in 2012.\nSam Underhill first tasted this fixture two years ago, coming off the bench but swiftly earning himself a yellow card as Scotland went on to clinch as 25-13 victory. Underhill admitted that after a lacklustre performance against France last time out, \u201cthe pressure is on\u201d but had a note of caution for the 10 members of England\u2019s 23-man squad preparing for a Murrayfield Test for the first time.\n\u201cIt was one of my first caps and first experience here at Murrayfield. It was probably my first insight into the emotion of the occasion and I was probably a bit naive to it before, getting booed off the bus and seeing the reaction of the Scotland players when they won, seeing the crowd and how much it means to everyone up here,\u201d said Underhill, who has a Scottish grandmother from the Borders. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something to acknowledge and it\u2019s definitely there \u2013 you can\u2019t ignore it \u2013 especially when it\u2019s as loud as Murrayfield is.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a bit of an edge to a game. Sports in general and rugby definitely, a few people have probably thought it\u2019s gone away from those rivalries and what underlies them, but having that edge is definitely a good thing for the game.\u201d\nEngland \n last year but found themselves 38-31 down after Finn Russell inspired a thrilling Scotland comeback, only for a late George Ford try to salvage a draw. Russell is still out of the picture for Scotland but England are equally wary of Adam Hastings\u2019s mercurial talents and his ability to spark his side\u2019s attack into life.\n\u201cI think you can learn a lot from previous internationals,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cEveryone has slight trends and tendencies. The game has become extremely unstructured so it\u2019s important to be able to adapt in that chaos. That\u2019s something that we want to get better at and something that we\u2019re focused on in our preparation.\u201d\nThe Six Nations organisers and the Scottish Rugby Union are continuing to monitor Storm Ciara closely with gusts of 50mph expected in Edinburgh. The Scotland captain Stuart Hogg believes his side will have a few \u201ctricks up their sleeve\u201d but Mitchell is adamant England can cope with the expected conditions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready for anything,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly in our preparation. We\u2019ve looked at all situations that could occur and weather is certainly one of those. It\u2019s important for us to be adaptable in those situations. I\u2019m not sure who it will favour. Certainly both teams will have to adapt to it. Should it come then it\u2019s adapting to what it presents in each of the halves.\u201d\nJonny May meanwhile, has admitted he does not know where he will be playing next season with his Leicester contract up in the summer. May moved to fifth on the list of all-time England try-scorers with two stunning efforts against France but faces a pay cut if he wants to stay at Welford Road because of salary cap constraints.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m out of contract so I need to try a bit harder.\u2019 Nobody knows what I\u2019m going to do yet, because I don\u2019t. We\u2019re playing Scotland and I swear to you, everything I\u2019m doing is focused on being the best I can be. Whenever there is a disappointing result all you can rip in until the next game.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/great-britain-fed-cup-heather-watson-harriet-dart-tennis": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/great-britain-fed-cup-heather-watson-harriet-dart-tennis", "title": "GB in Fed Cup trouble after Heather Watson and Harriet Dart defeats", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 21:05:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 Watson beaten by Slovakia\u2019s Anna Karolina Schmiedlova\u2022 Fed Cup debutant Dart loses to Viktoria Kuzmova in three sets</p><p>Great Britain face a struggle to reach the Fed Cup Finals after going 2-0 down on the opening day of Fed Cup Qualifiers in Bratislava.

After Anna Karolina Schmiedlova thoroughly outplayed Heather Watson 6-2, 6-3, Harriet Dart produced a desperate, courageous performance in her first live \n rubber, but she eventually lost 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.\nWatson had arrived dreaming of a different opener. When \n last year to reach the now defunct World Group II for the first time in 26 years, the team\u2019s joy came at a delicate period for Watson. She was forced to watch from her bed at home, crippled by sickness. Despite her years of service, she would not have played even if she had been fit; she had fallen out of the top 100 with a six-match losing streak. It has taken courage for her to turn her form around since the end of 2019, rising back into the top 100 and arriving in Bratislava with the possibility of righting in the absence of Johanna Konta.\nHer problem was the simple difference between a player who was born on the dirt and one still learning to play on the surface. From the first exchanges on the indoor clay of Slovakia\u2019s National \n Center, Schmiedlova flew into her strokes with long, perfectly judged sliding as Watson\u2019s excellent defence was slowed by the slippery clay. While Schmiedlova\u2019s loopy top-spin strokes and wicked angles are built precisely to work her opponents to death on the slow clay, Watson\u2019s strokes are flatter and her game is more linear, built on the hard courts of Guernsey. She felt that her only hope was to stand on the baseline and hit through the surface.\nWatson battled well in the opening stages, feathering a series of delicate drop-shot winners and engaging in bruising rallies, but Schmiedlova\u2019s counterpunching forced Watson out of her comfort zone and the Slovak eventually marched to victory with an accomplished performance.\nThe pressure rested on Dart\u2019s shoulders for the second rubber. She stood at the baseline without a single live Fed Cup rubber to her name, only 16 clay-court matches in her record and a highest ranking win of 64. Her stress was high and her odds even higher against No 65 Viktoria Kuzmova. Many better players would have crumbled, but Dart handled herself exceptionally, fighting hard to the death.\nIn her young career, Dart has shown that she can make up for her lack of weaponry and experience with fight. She arrived prepared to shoulder the pressure, opening the match serving incredibly well and controlling most of the rallies off the ground. Dart breezed through her opening service games and then saved three set points.\nAs Kuzmova eventually found her range on her powerful groundstrokes and rolled through seven consecutive games in the middle of the second set, it seemed the match would quickly fall her way as she moved to a 5-2 third-set lead. But Dart refused to buckle. She resolutely held serve and then disdainfully dismissed a match point on the Slovak\u2019s serve with a searing backhand down the line.\nOn her own serve at 5-4, Dart saved four match points including one with an astonishing exhibition of defence and grit, retrieving two overheads and then forcing a Kuzmova error. As the Slovak gagged, spraying errors and looking helplessly to her team, Dart\u2019s temperament was outstanding and her focus was relentless.\nIt took six match points and two hours 55 minutes for the Slovak No 1 to defeat her. Dart may not possess the biggest game and she currently does not have a coach or a permanent training base, but the 23-year-old has many years of battling ahead. No matter how the second day goes, the No 141 should leave Bratislava a little more hopeful about being among the likes of Kuzmova in the top 100 soon.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/scotland-rugby-england-six-nations-stuart-hogg-josh-taylor": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/scotland-rugby-england-six-nations-stuart-hogg-josh-taylor", "title": "Stuart Hogg says Scotland fired up for England by Josh Taylor\u2019s fighting talk", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 22:00:19 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 World champion boxer pays Six Nations squad a visit<br>\u2022 Scotland unbeaten in last two games against England</p><p>Scotland have been fired up for their Six Nations clash with England by a fighting team talk from the world light-welterweight boxing champion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/josh-taylor-regis-prograis-world-boxing-super-series-final\" title=\"\">Josh Taylor</a>.

Nonetheless England go into Saturday\u2019s match as favourites despite beginning their campaign with a disappointing defeat by France but Hogg revealed Taylor\u2019s words of encouragement had helped instil belief.\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to coming here and supporting us,\u201d said Hogg, who missed last year\u2019s fixture through injury. \u201cHe has excelled in his sport and I loved hearing from him.

I\u2019m excited to learn from him \u2013 and no doubt he will get us riled up.\u201d\nScotland are braced for an onslaught from England after Eddie Jones announced sweeping changes to his side on Thursday and named six forwards on the replacements bench. The weather is also likely to be a factor with Storm Ciara set to hit Edinburgh on Saturday evening with gusts of up to 50mph forecast. The \n organisers have said they are \u201cmonitoring the situation\u201d and are in dialogue with the unions but Hogg believes wet and windy weather will suit the home side better.\n\u201cIt\u2019s classic Scottish weather,\u201d added Hogg. \u201cWe\u2019re used to it. We\u2019ve got a couple of tricks up our sleeve. Hopefully if the weather comes in we can adapt because it will be the team that does that the quickest that will have the best outcome.\n\u201cIt will be a tough physical challenge up front with them having a six-two split on the bench. But our boys are fully aware of that and to get a foothold in the game they\u2019re going to have to stand up and go toe-to-toe and better them. It\u2019s an exciting one for our forward pack.\u201d\nHogg has the benefit of now plying his trade at Exeter to give his teammates valuable insight into England\u2019s players, having made a fast start to life at Sandy Park. Despite confrontational comments coming out of both camps this week, Hogg insists he has nothing but respect for the opponents.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to play for a few of their boys on Lions tours and they\u2019re world-class,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cWe want an opportunity to turn them over. I fully believe in our team, that we can do that and we\u2019ll do everything in our power.

Archer might be tempted to post something similar in response to the news \n that has only now been diagnosed correctly.\nI told you I had a serious, debilitating injury: one I\u2019ve played with since the World Cup while bowling more overs than any other England cricketer. And while simultaneously being accused, sotto voce, of not always trying, of being a complex character, of not \u201cletting rip\u201d when the team demanded it.\nIn the meantime, well, not exactly a surprise, is it? In play-writing there\u2019s a principle known as Chekhov\u2019s gun. This dictates that if there\u2019s a rifle hanging above the fireplace in Act One, it\u2019s going to be fired at someone\u2019s head by the end of Act Five.\nA similar process applies to England cricket, fast bowlers and any kind of unorthodox, non-standard talent. Stick all three of them on the same stage and you can be pretty sure before long the air will be thick with gunpowder smoke, wrong turns and a generalised fug of error and confusion.\nLet\u2019s not dress it up. Archer has been miserably treated this winter, and only occasionally by the opposition. He has carried a serious injury, undiagnosed. He\u2019s been rebuked for riding a Segway, thereby embarrassing his coaches in front of the CEO, a tier-one crime against the blue Lycra hierarchy. He\u2019s been asked to bowl 42 overs in his first overseas Test, or 5% of all the balls he\u2019d ever bowled in first-class cricket. He\u2019s been in tears after failing a fitness test in Johannesburg he should never, with hindsight, have been asked to take.\nLook clearly and Archer is entirely blameless in all of these things: a self-made 24-year-old cricketer, an inspiring story against the odds, and a man who might smile to himself at being lectured on toughness in adversity by the pathway products around him. So what is happening here?\nTwo things stand out. First, Archer is an outsider in so many ways in the narrow parish of elite English cricket. It isn\u2019t simply the fact he grew up in Barbados, or is a rare black male cricketer to earn a full ECB contract. It\u2019s also the fact he\u2019s from another place as a sportsman, talked about as though he\u2019s some bright-eyed creature found shivering in the treeline, the guy who wears his jumper around his waist, who doesn\u2019t carry the familiar signifiers of this sealed sporting-industrial life.\nStatements such as these should be seen in the context of both these layers of otherness: \u201cHe needs to ramp it up more ... The energy and effort have to be there all the time.\u201d \u201cWe want every ball to be an effort ball.\u201d \u201cYour body hurts at times ... You\u2019ve just got to choose to do it, really.\u201d \u201cCulturally he is different.\u201d\nThe words, there, of England\u2019s captain, head coach and director of cricket at various times this winter. Speaking, to be clear, about a bloke bowling through a stress fracture, while leading England\u2019s attack in his first season of international cricket. All of these quotes are set in the middle of warm words about Archer\u2019s performances, all couched with sympathetic talk about how much he is putting in. But still, there are words and phrases that jar. Trying hard. Culture. Effort. \u201cYes, this does hurt, son. But get on with it, eh?\u201d\nPlus we\u2019ve had the standard klaxon-parping talk about body language, about unacceptable diet, about the need to really \u201cbust a gut\u201d in training. Nobody else gets this stuff. Nobody mentions Stuart Broad\u2019s up-and-down intensity levels, the sense of a bowler (successfully and correctly) looking after himself. Nobody urges Joe Root himself to put \u201cmore effort\u201d in or talks about mental fragility when he keeps getting out just past 50. Why not?\nI\u2019m not qualified to define the mechanics of being a black athlete in a white sporting culture. But you do see patterns, faint memories of the way football has been, echoes of Daniel Sturridge (but not Andy Carroll) being accused of having \u201ca low pain threshold\u201d or Ron Noades talking about the need for hard white players to get you through the winter.\nI don\u2019t think this is conscious, or founded in ill-will. But it strikes a false note. More to the point, it won\u2019t help get the best out of a stellar, highly specialised cricketing talent. Clearly there is a need to take a look at how England\u2019s homogeneous \u201cteam culture\u201d deals with difference, outsiderdom and unusual ways of being a highly talented cricketer.\nThis isn\u2019t just about accepting some people walk and speak and respond a little differently. It\u2019s about the need to take care of a once-in-a-generation athlete who can bowl his second ball at 92mph, and who should be treated with the level of informed sports science his talent demands.\nThe issue of \u201cover-bowling\u201d will of course rumble around, a process that feels like using your handcrafted Glock pistol to bang in a fence post, but which is above all a sign of confusion.\nThe only people I\u2019ve heard talk compelling sense about Archer are Mike Selvey, who compared his style to Jeff Thomson, and seemed to say if you think Archer\u2019s not trying you don\u2019t understand the mechanics of fast bowling; and Archer\u2019s coach at the Rajasthan Royals, who works specifically on short bursts, on understanding his specific physicality, his personality, the way his body works.\nFor now a quiet apology and a reboot in the relationship would be a good start. Handled right, Archer can be a source of delight. This is what success looks like: right there.

Slept in,\u201d he says, sheepishly. \u201cWe had to be in at 9.30am for the pre-match walkthrough because it was an evening game and the bus was leaving at 10.30am. Zeina [the club\u2019s player liaison officer] came and woke me up at the house. I was about an hour late for being on time to training and about 20 minutes after the bus as well.\n\u201cThat was the penny-dropping moment, because I was at home while they were playing and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I was distraught. My dad drove down from Stoke to be with me that night and the night after to check I was all right. That was definitely the turning point where [I realised] it wasn\u2019t all rosy, it wasn\u2019t academy football any more and I\u2019m very grateful the manager gave me a second chance. I think I\u2019ve taken it.\u201d\nRamsdale was fined and sent on loan to AFC Wimbledon, then bottom of League One, for the rest of the season. \u201cIt was good for me to go and play the games but I think they probably didn\u2019t want to see me for a few weeks.\u201d\nThrown in at the deep end of a relegation scrap, Ramsdale regards those months as a priceless experience and a blessing in disguise. He made a big impression and Gareth Southgate invited him to train with England in March. \u201cEven if it was just carrying the balls, that would have been fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI went back to Wimbledon, we got beat 4-0 by Gillingham and I dropped one in the goal. All of the lads were giving me stick.\n\u201cI got hammered, but I\u2019d do the same in the same situation. I did a lot of growing up on loan, personally and mentally, which has helped me adapt to life in the Premier League.\n\u201cMy advice to any young player is to try and go to these places because they make you a better person and not just a better footballer. What those six months have done for me, it was a major part in my career.\u201d\nThe 21-year-old, the youngest first-choice goalkeeper in the Premier League, is an endearing and jovial character. It is a marker of his personality that last month, when forced to miss his first league game of the season through injury, he joined fans in the Steve Fletcher Stand to cheer on his teammates against Watford.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go and give it massive, stand up, be really confident and sing the wrong lyrics. If I\u2019m starting a chant, I need to be nailing it. It was just a shame we couldn\u2019t put a performance on because I would have liked to celebrate with the fans.\u201d\nRamsdale acknowledges his mistakes, choosing the wrong time to play the class clown and allowing confidence to spill into arrogance, which he believes stems from when he was released by Bolton at 15, but feels he has matured immeasurably. \u201cNow I\u2019ll go home and cook myself some food or get a snack rather than either not eating or getting chocolate. I\u2019ll do my own washing rather than getting a cleaner to do it, or leaving it and taking it home to my mum; doing my bed; being on time; actually looking presentable when I come in to training. I used to think: \u2018I\u2019m getting in for 8.30am, no one is going to see me, I\u2019m just going to turn up and go home,\u2019 but now I\u2019m coming in and, even if it\u2019s just a tracksuit, at least the tracksuit hasn\u2019t got stains or creases. I used to wear odd socks and throw anything together I could find.\n\u201cI just looked a scruff. That has taken care of off the pitch but being involved in one relegation [when Chesterfield went out of the Football League] and seeing people lose their jobs and one where we managed to stay up and the euphoria that brought [at Wimbledon] \u2026 I now know when to speak and when not to speak, I know situations in a room, and if it is awkward I know not to just come out and try and be funny. It\u2019s growing up, having more experience and more knowledge of situations.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Ramsdale returns to Sheffield United, who sold him to Bournemouth for \u00a3800,000 three years ago, while in League One, on Chris Wilder\u2019s wedding day. \u201cHe reminds me of that quite a lot,\u201d says a smiling Ramsdale. He has fond memories of Bramall Lane, but these days he is a key pillar of a Bournemouth side searching for a third successive league win in their fight for survival. At the other end of the pitch will be Dean Henderson, another exciting English goalkeeping prospect.\nRamsdale\u2019s ascendancy has been so sudden that, three days before his league debut against his former club on the first day of the season, and 24 hours before Eddie Howe informed him he was going to be his No 1, he was absent from the Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football game. The goalkeeper had to ask Bournemouth\u2019s media team to ensure he was available for selection.\n\u201cI said: \u2018If I get to the stage where I am playing that first game and I\u2019m not on there, my God, I\u2019ll be quite disappointed,\u2019 so I sort of played the guilt-trip card,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I was the only person on the game that had me in their team. I started that first game and got myself two points. I checked the \u2018selected\u2019 and it didn\u2019t even say 0.1%, but I had myself so it must have been 0.00001% \u2013 and that was me.\u201d\nAfter \nin December, Ramsdale was the highest scoring goalkeeper in Fantasy Football. That mantle now belongs to Henderson but what would have been his response to being top of the pile 12 months ago? \u201cI\u2019d have laughed, to be honest,\u201d he says . \u201cYeah, I\u2019d have come up with something stupid and sarky.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/lisa-ashton-dont-want-special-treatment-women-darts-pdc-mens-tour", "title": "Lisa Ashton: \u2018I don\u2019t want special treatment as the first woman on the men\u2019s darts tour\u2019", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 16:53:36 GMT", "summary": "Four-time women\u2019s world champion qualified for the PDC tour by a tiny margin and she celebrated with tea and a takeaway<p>The Barnsley Metrodome is not exactly the first place you think of when it comes to the twists and turns of women\u2019s sport.

Ashton\u2019s appearance at the PDC World Championship two years ago, when she narrowly lost to Jan Dekker in the first round, emphasised the growing quality in the women\u2019s game. But in recent months, women\u2019s darts has gained more mainstream media attention than ever before.\n memorable run at Alexandra Palace at Christmas sent darts into a new era but this weekend, when Ashton becomes the first woman to play full time on the men\u2019s PDC tour at the first events of 2020, darts will reach a new level, with a woman playing men for the same prize money in the same tournaments on a regular basis.\nAshton, a four-time world champion in the British \n Organisation, is philosophical about what becoming the first woman to come through the gruelling four-day Q School event and earn a two-year tour card means for darts. But as she explains: \u201cI don\u2019t want any special treatment. I don\u2019t want to be thought of as Lisa Ashton, the first woman to play on the men\u2019s tour. No thank you.\n\u201cI want to be Lisa Ashton, the dart player. If someone beats me, fair enough. Whether I\u2019m a man or a woman shouldn\u2019t come into it.\u201d\nShe has played against men in exhibitions for years and is honest enough to admit there is still some resentment towards ladies darts in dwindling corners of the sport.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a fair few male players who I think feel the pressure because they don\u2019t want to lose to a woman \u2013 hopefully that helps me out this year,\u201d she laughs.\nAshton will be a full-time professional on the PDC for at least the next two years, opening the door to previously unimaginable riches. There is more than \u00a314m available each year on the PDC tour: a far cry from the recent edition of the BDO World Championship, when Ashton earned only \u00a34,500 as the runner-up.\nSherrock has emerged as the face of women\u2019s darts thanks to her run at Alexandra Palace but that does not seem to bother Ashton, who has been the standard-bearer in the BDO for years and has been ready to test herself against the men for a while. \u201cI missed out by a point at Q School last year but this time I came back with the serious intention of getting a card,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the ladies game snowball in recent years and knew this was the next step, one of us getting a card. Fallon has made the headlines, and wasn\u2019t she brilliant at Ally Pally? But below her, myself and Mikuru [Suzuki, the reigning women\u2019s world champion], there\u2019s so many names coming through. I think it\u2019s just the start. Barry Hearn said if the women were good enough, they\u2019d get opportunities. We\u2019ve proven that can happen.\u201d\nAshton gained her tour card at Q School on legs difference, after a seven-hour wait on the final day to learn her fate. She was one or two legs away from missing out on her dream of becoming a PDC professional. \u201cI was so emotionally exhausted, I celebrated by going home, making a brew and ordering a takeaway,\u201d she smiles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sunk in. It probably won\u2019t until I get there on Saturday and see Michael van Gerwen, Gerwyn Price and the rest of them and think: \u2018Wow, I\u2019m playing these guys every week now.\u2019\u201d Her tour card gives her the opportunity to play at the biggest events, including the UK Open in March, which Sherrock has herself reached via a local qualifying event.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could play each other in a PDC event on TV,\u201d Ashton says. \u201cIt\u2019d be great because one of us is definitely through, but hopefully that isn\u2019t until the latter rounds.\u201d A return to Alexandra Palace at the end of this year is also high on the agenda \u2013 but for now, Ashton is simply keen to enjoy the moment in Barnsley this weekend and settle into her new life as a professional.\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing we can play darts now,\u201d she insists. \u201cFor years, people thought women playing darts was a bit of a novelty but now people can see we\u2019re good enough. To break that glass ceiling, inspire a few more ladies to take the game seriously and believe they can play with the men would be on a par with anything I\u2019ve done in the game.

Because all that was 22 years ago, when he was the player who had been dropped, replaced by Duncan Hodge, and he was arguing with the backs coach John Rutherford. This time around, Townsend is the coach, and Finn Russell is the player on the out.\nThe comparison is not exact. Russell was cut because of that \n, the Scottish Rugby Union\u2019s polite euphemism for a drinking jag and going awol from training the next day. Townsend works closely with the organisational psychologist Damian Hughes, who wrote a book on the \u201cBarcelona way\u201d. Hughes is a great believer in what he calls \u201ctrademark behaviours\u201d. You do not need to be a devotee of Hughes\u2019s brand of \n to appreciate that skipping training is not one of them.\nBut that was a while back already, and does not explain why Russell is still not being considered for selection. \u201c\n. The word is he is still \n. In the background of all this is the row between Russell\u2019s father, Keith, and the SRU. He was the director of domestic rugby until he was sacked in 2017. He sued them for unfair dismissal and won a six-figure settlement in an employment tribunal. The fallout did not reflect well on the SRU\u2019s chief executive, Mark Dodson. \n and that the case put his son \n. They are a close family.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very aware of how the SRU has treated myself and so it\u2019s made it really difficult for him this year to go out, whether it\u2019s Glasgow at Scotstoun or Scotland at Murrayfield, knowing there are people in the stand who have just summarily dismissed his father with no justification, with no process or anything else,\u201d Keith said at the time.\nKeith\u2019s wife, \n \u201cit used to be like a dream\u201d to watch her boy playing for Scotland, but that \u201cnow it is for ever tainted.\u201d\nWhen Russell decided to move to Racing 92, Dodson said the SRU could not compete with the \u201csuperstar money\u201d on offer in France. Keith Russell claimed they had not tried, because they never made Finn an offer to stay. \n.\nTownsend has been around Scottish rugby long enough to have lived through similar rows, and he might have found a way round all this. But at the same time his relationship with Russell appears to have broken down. Scott Hastings described it on Sky this week as a \u201cclash of personalities\u201d. It first blew up at Twickenham last year, during Scotland\u2019s 38-38 draw with England. They had been cut to pieces in that first half, but in the second Russell sparked an astonishing comeback. He set up two tries and scored a third himself.\nIt was one of the great displays of spontaneous attacking rugby, of a kind Russell does better than almost any other player around. And it grew out of a row with Townsend. \u201cI actually had an argument with Gregor,\u201d Russell told ITV after the match. \u201cI said to him: \u2018You\u2019re telling us to kick and when we kick, they just run it back and cut us open, and when we run it, they\u2019re just hitting us behind the gain line and winning the ball back.\u2019 Second half, we just came out with nothing to lose, played our rugby, kicked out of our half and scored some great tries. We played good Scottish rugby.\u201d\n. \u201cFinn and Gregor just kind of having a big domestic. It was more about tactics. I think we kicked a lot in the first half, it didn\u2019t really work and we needed to change it. Gregor wasn\u2019t really happy. You\u2019ve got some people who say things just to be heard, for their voice to be recognised. But when Finn says something, he\u2019s saying it for a reason. You\u2019ve got one guy who\u2019s out on the park getting eaten up and spat back out. Then you\u2019ve got another who\u2019s just angry. These two guys come head-to-head.\u201d\nA year later, it feels as if Scotland are still trying to figure out exactly what \u201cgood Scottish rugby\u201d looks like, but it seems pretty clear that Townsend and Russell do not always agree on it. The hectic, high-tempo, approach they have used in the last two years came up short at the World Cup, and Townsend and his new captain, Stuart Hogg, are trying to develop a cannier, more cautious style.\nHogg made some telling comments at the \n launch, when he was asked if Scotland needed to work on their game management. No one mentioned Russell. Until he did: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a guy like Finn Russell at 10 who just wants to chuck the pill about the paddock all the time, you\u2019ve got to rein him in every now and then,\u201d Hogg said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t score points in our own half unless it\u2019s massively on for us to chuck the ball about, and for us now it\u2019s about when to play and when to kick.\u201d There are echoes here of the rows Townsend used to have with his coach Jim Telfer, only this time he is on the other side of the argument.\nRussell, who was part of Scotland\u2019s senior players group, has stayed in touch with the talented young fly-half who has replaced him, Adam Hastings, and they spoke on the Friday night before the Ireland game. It seems his relations with Townsend, though, still have a way to go. England at least, will be grateful. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d Eddie Jones said the last time England came up to Murrayfield, when Russell orchestrated a 25-13 win, and one they will be happy they do not have to face on Saturday.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics", "title": "Edwin Moses: \u2018We all knew doping was happening ... it was a dark period in athletics\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 13:06:42 GMT", "summary": "The two-time Olympic 400m hurdles champion on his fight against doping, his amazing unbeaten streak and meeting Nelson Mandela<p>The number 999 is burned into Edwin Moses\u2019s psyche.

It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport.\nMoses has helped lead the clampdown on \n. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, even as \u201cauthorised neutrals\u201d, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition need to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its individual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I worked out three times a day,\u201d he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. \u201cI ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.\u201d\nThis was not the template used by cheating athletes. \u201cWe all knew it was happening,\u201d Moses says. \u201cWe knew doping was wide scale because there was no drug testing \u2013 beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated.\n\u201cI\u2019m a physicist. I\u2019ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the eastern bloc women. They were much more manly than me.\n\u201cThen, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world.\n\u201cA few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it\u2019s continued for a long time. It\u2019s finally changing now but I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don\u2019t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That\u2019s why we have out-of-competition drug testing \u2013 because of what I and a few others did in 1988.\u201d\nAthletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in \n, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport.\n\u201c\n, I put together a group of 10 US athletes. We demanded [out-of-competition] testing in the US. We got the money and legislation and drew up the drug programme from scratch because no one had ever done it. We got it ratified and the following year the US Olympic Committee adopted our programme. I became the chief of US testing from 1989 to 1994.\n\u201cThere was no such thing as Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] and, in the US, I was chairman of the committee for the big six Olympic sports. I negotiated agreements to test athletes and that was the first testing outside competition.\u201d\nThe 64-year-old Moses seems energised by World Athletics. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an outstanding battle in the fight against doping and hopefully the corrupt people are gone. \n. World Athletics put out a statement saying unless the Russians apologise for the last transgression [when their federation conspired to hide the truth with the 2018 world indoor high jump champion, Danil Lysenko, who missed three doping tests], they\u2019re rescinding the possibility of their athletes competing in Tokyo. Period. They\u2019ll stop all of them.\u201d\nAt the world championships in Doha last October, 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia won six medals \u2013 despite their country being banned for four years. \u201cThe ones they allowed to compete [in Doha] were tested as much as anyone else. If they can\u2019t show the same evidence there\u2019s no reason to let them compete. I feel that way about any athlete from the many areas of the world where there\u2019s very little testing. But this latest news is significant. Someone\u2019s got to stand up for the right thing.\u201d\nDoes he expect Russia to back down and apologise? \u201cNo. I doubt it.\u201d\nMoses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada \u2013 as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the International Olympic Committee. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada\u2019s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. \n in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to \u201cshut up\u201d by some Wada officials.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that \u2013 alongside Beckie and others on the athletes\u2019 commission \u2013 we forced Wada to look at its governance,\u201d Moses says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ve been able to \n. Changes were made to bring an ethical balance to the way Wada is run internally. The Russians got caught red-handed and the evidence was clear from two investigations.\n\u201cBut politically it was perceived differently because of the money Russia puts into sports. If it had been a completely independent group that had nothing to do with international federations or the IOC, it would not have dragged on. At Wada they had federation guys and IOC guys who were not looking out for the best [anti-doping] interests. That was the innate problem. We forced them to deal with those issues.\u201d\nWill Wada be stronger now? \u201cWe will see. The new president at Wada, Witold Banka, is a [former Poland] athlete. I think the strain in anti-doping politics has been taken out because the leadership has changed. That was the elephant in the room. It started at the top [with the former president Craig Reedie being associated with the IOC].\u201d\nIs the war against doping being won? \u201cOur deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we\u2019re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They\u2019re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we\u2019re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That\u2019s brought in a whole new way of testing.\u201d\nMoses is also a passionate ambassador for \n \u2013 the group that celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people. He cites the moment when he \n at the inaugural Laureus awards in 2000 as \u201cone of the big moments of my life. What he said that night, about the power of sport, was so pertinent. I saw people crying in the audience. From then on I applied all the hard work, the discipline, the winning \u2013 all the positive things I learned from sport \u2013 to Laureus and helped build a great organisation. It\u2019s been as satisfying as sport itself.\u201d\nStressing the wider social and political power of sport, Moses encourages athletes to protest openly against racism, homophobia and other forms of injustice. He talks knowledgeably about football\u2019s enduring problems with racism and supports those England players who have \n the next time they are subjected to racial abuse. \u201cI would agree with them. If that\u2019s what it takes, that\u2019s a small price to pay for the indignity human beings suffer. I would have walked off the track if I had seen something like that.\u201d\nMoses also backs \n against police brutality and racism in the US. In contrast, when asked about Donald Trump, Moses says: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about our president.\u201d\nThe IOC has said it will ban \n but Moses rejects this aim. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can stop it. It\u2019s an individual discretionary endeavour and history shows you can\u2019t stop protest.\u201d\nSporting history confirms that, for those nine years, nine months and nine days, Moses was also unstoppable. Before he races off to his next meeting in Atlanta I ask him about the astonishing streak that began after he lost a race in Berlin against the German 400m hurdler Harald Schmid. A week later in D\u00fcsseldorf, Moses beat Schmid by 15 metres. Did the pain of defeat drive him for the next decade?\n\u201cThat was a funny day. Before the race I\u2019m sitting at the pool when I should\u2019ve been working out at the track. But I was winning the race until I made a mistake at the last hurdle because I was running so slow. I used 14 steps instead of 13. That\u2019s why I lost. But it taught me a lesson. You have to be 100% ready all the time. Don\u2019t take anything for granted. After that I did not have any problems for almost 10 years.\u201d\nWas it particularly painful when he finally lost a race, to Danny Harris? \u201cNo. When I first started I lost all the time. Losing is part of the game. If you lose you figure out what you did wrong and fix it up. If it had been another five metres, I would probably have caught him. I\u2019d been suffering from food poisoning and nearly pulled out but I was paid my money and I ran.\u201d\nA few months later, Moses beat Harris to gold at the world championships. \u201cI was happy and the fact I had lost to him was beside the point. Most people lose.\u201d\nMoses almost always won but is there a danger his remarkable sporting record may be forgotten? \u201cNo. Just last week Tiger Woods said he believed \n. As time goes on, it becomes more meaningful and significant. It\u2019s been 33 years since I quit. No one\u2019s even come close to my record. And it\u2019s doubtful anyone will.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/football-quiz-guess-the-stadium": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/football-quiz-guess-the-stadium", "title": "Football quiz: guess the stadiums in these artistic images", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 14:00:38 GMT", "summary": "<p>Do you know the San Siro from Selhurst Park, Anfield from the Amex?

Arfield hammered in a fourth in added time to give an unfair reflection of the game and put Steven Gerrard\u2019s side into Sunday\u2019s quarter-final draw.\nNo Cup tie between these two clubs is complete without reference to Accies famously knocking Rangers out of the Scottish Cup in 1987 but there was to be no repeat, although the home side can take positives from their performance.\nPerhaps with a view to the league game against Aberdeen on Tuesday night, Accies boss Brian Rice, sitting in the stand serving a ban for breaching Scottish FA betting regulations, made six changes to his side. \n, Will Collar, Smith, Steve Davies, Andy Dales and Andy Winter came in while midfielder Glen Kamara replaced Steve Davis for Rangers.\nThere were only four minutes played when Romania international Ianis Hagi headed a Ryan Kent cross past the post, before Rangers keeper Allan McGregor was asked to save a low drive from Smith.\nArfield\u2019s first goal came after 17-year-old defender Jamie Hamilton fouled Ibrox striker Morelos as they tangled in the box. Southwood guessed right at the penalty but the ball came back out to Arfield who knocked it back into the net.\nReferee Alan Muir ignored an Accies penalty claim when Dales tumbled inside the box after a challenge by Kent, just before Southwood brilliantly saved a close-range drive from Morelos after he had been set up by Hagi.\nHamilton had to readjust when injured duo Dales and Davies had to go off with injuries with Mickel Miller and Marios Ogkmpoe coming on, but the latter, a powerful striker, soon set up Smith to steer a drive low past McGregor.\nMorelos fired over as stunned Rangers responded and Southwood denied Kent just before the interval, with Rangers defender Connor Goldson surviving a penalty claim for handball inside the visitors\u2019 penalty area sandwiched in between.\nAccies suffered another blow when substitute Miller, after picking up a hamstring complaint, was replaced for the start of the second half by Blair Alston, the last of their three substitutes.\nRangers slowly stepped up the pressure in the second-half but the Lanarkshire outfit continued to defend with impressive organisation and determination. \nHowever, as Andy Halliday waited to replace left-back Borna Barisic, Aribo calmly stabbed in a Kent cross from eight yards. Southwood then clutched a 25-yard free-kick from Rangers captain James Tavernier out of the air before Davis replaced Hagi.\nAnother Rangers substitute Greg Stewart, on for Kent, was involved in Rangers\u2019 third when his blocked shot spun up into the air with Morelos nipping in to head in from six yards. Arfield saved the best for last, lashing in a drive from the edge of the box which went in off the underside of the bar.\nAfter the game, Steven Gerrard backed Morelos to return to his best form. \u201cI think he looked sharp today,\u201d said the Rangers manager. \u201cThere was part of his play which was typical Alfredo, where he was undefendable.\n\u201cHe was strong, powerful and he ran through the defender for the penalty, which was obviously the breakthrough we were looking for. He was in the right place at the right time and he still had to do a little bit with the header.\n\u201cHopefully that goal will spring him on to more now because we need him firing as quick as possible. All forwards, especially No 9s, get confidence and belief from goals.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/goodison-hosts-wsl-liverpool-everton-derby": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/goodison-hosts-wsl-liverpool-everton-derby", "title": "Goodison hosts first WSL match as Liverpool visit Everton for derby", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:00:34 GMT", "summary": "Hopes that ground draws more than 20,000 fans 100 years after Dick, Kerr Ladies played St Helens there in front of 53,000<p>When Willie Kirk\u2019s Everton side step out on to the Goodison Park turf on Sunday there will be a feeling that things have come symbolically full circle.

Slowly the damage done by the exiling of the women\u2019s game is being undone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge occasion,\u201d says Kirk thoughtfully. \u201cEveryone at the club, the staff, the players, have been really excited about it, to be honest, ever since we knew it was a possibility and the club were working to make it happen.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to be over 20,000. That would be fantastic. The club have made a real conscious effort to push the game, we\u2019ve got a lot of signage in the city centre and there\u2019s a lot going out on social media.\u201d\nIf the incentive of doing the double over Liverpool was not enough, with \n, they also have the added ambition of attempting to top the 23,500 watching that game at Anfield. \u201cThe intensity in training has been very good because everyone is desperate to be playing,\u201d says the 41-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s a rivalry. It matters. If it\u2019s tiddlywinks, under-10s football, beating a crowd, that rivalry always means that you want to win. It\u2019s good because it incentivises the club to make it work properly.\u201d\nKirk\u2019s turnaround of Everton has been incredibly impressive. When the manager swapped his six-month stint as Casey Stoney\u2019s number two at Manchester United for Finch Farm the team had only one win, in the Continental League Cup. By the end of the season they had three, including two against Liverpool, to finish second bottom as Kirk plotted his rebuild. Eighteen months on from his trip along the M62 Everton are fifth, just a point behind Manchester United as they fight it out to be the best-of-the-rest behind Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal.\n\u201cWhen we got to the summer we said our target was top half. We felt it was slightly ambitious at the time but we\u2019ve got a really good group of players, so I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d says Kirk, who has not been turned down by the club in any request he has made since joining, be it transfers or working practices.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be until next season that you really see the Everton that we want to see. We\u2019ve still got inconsistencies, we\u2019re still trying to develop the players, we\u2019re still trying to really entrain our philosophies and we\u2019ve got plans for the transfer window in the summer to further improve the squad. This season, hopefully by the end of it, will be one that can be deemed successful but that can be further improved.\u201d\nThis season their form has been erratic but they have already doubled their win tally. \u201cWe won three league games on the bounce,\u201d says Kirk with a smile. \u201cI only know that because I\u2019ve agreed to take the players for pizza when we win three in a row. We did it once. I thought we were at the start of a run of games but the inconsistencies are there.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the next thing for us. Rack up three wins again and then after that it\u2019s about taking points off the top three. I feel like over 90 minutes we can challenge any team; over the course of a season it is a completely different matter but we need to start taking points off the top three, the top four.\u201d\nTheir Goodison adventure could not come at a better time. Already the team have had two games postponed, one at their home ground in Southport. There have been seven WSL games pushed back so far. Everton are waiting to move to Walton Hall Park. \u201cAt the start of the season we thought we\u2019d be in there by now. It\u2019s been delayed for a number of reasons,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cA lot of them out of our control, but that\u2019s very close now.\u201d\nBut this period of turf trouble has put the quick professionalisation of the league in context. \u201cI think this has been the worst season since they changed it back to a winter league; it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice little reality check for us, of where the women\u2019s game is and where we still need to improve. We\u2019re talking about VAR and goalline technology but let\u2019s get the pitches up to spec first.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/sabri-lamouchi-the-distance-nottingham-forest": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/sabri-lamouchi-the-distance-nottingham-forest", "title": "Sabri Lamouchi aims to last the distance with improving Forest | Paul Doyle", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 22:00:19 GMT", "summary": "Manager is looking long term with Nottingham Forest and wants to take them back to the Premier League this year<p>There was one thing Sabri Lamouchi always dreamed of doing when he was a player but had to wait until he hung up his boots to do: the New York Marathon.

But his reason for mentioning the tale is he reckons his \n team could take inspiration from it as they approach what he terms \u201cthe most crucial\u201d part of the Championship run-in. On Saturday fourth-placed Forest host second-placed Leeds; on Tuesday they play Charlton; and next weekend they travel to the leaders, West Brom.\nAll those teams have stumbled recently \u2013 Forest\u2019s \n came to a surprising end last week when they lost at Birmingham, while Leeds\u2019 form has lapsed so badly some of the Elland Road faithful have turned heretic and started casting doubt on the doctrine of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s infallibility. Promotion will go to whoever recovers and finishes strongest.\nThe way Forest have played this season has got their fans thinking Lamouchi is the man who will get them back to the Premier League at last. He is the 24th manager \u2013 including caretakers \u2013 to try since Forest were relegated in 1999, which is why he said his primary goal when he got the job in June was just to complete a season. \u201cThe last [manager] to do one full season here was 10 years ago [Billy Davies in 2010-11]. That\u2019s too much [change]!\u201d\nBut he has done more than hang in; he has got Forest looking strong among the front runners. To do that he has had to adapt quickly. The \n poses a very different challenge to the ones he faced as manager at Rennes and in Qatar and Ivory Coast.\n\u201cSometimes I wake up and I don\u2019t know what day it is,\u201d he says of the division\u2019s relentlessness. \u201cYou just need to make priorities and bring the players immediately with you \u2013 be clear about what you want and what you don\u2019t want,\u201d he says before admitting the task became more complicated when his first two matches resulted in a home defeat by West Brom and a last-gasp 1-1 draw at Leeds. \u201cAfter two games we had one point so [there was] some doubt. Some people were probably worried because before I signed nobody knew me. But the players have done a fantastic job. Now what I am saying to them is: \u2018It has been fantastic [so far] but what you can and must do [next] will be amazing for the rest of your lives.\u2019\u201d\nThat message is understood particularly well by players such as Matty Cash, Joe Worrall and Ryan Yates, who have graduated from the club\u2019s academy to become leading performers under Lamouchi. \u201cThe players [reared at] Forest start to dream like the fans,\u201d says Lamouchi. \u201cThey just want to play in the best competition with this shirt because they started here.\u201d\nCash agrees. He has been converted from a winger to a right-back so successfully by Lamouchi that several clubs, including West Ham and Milan, tried to buy him last month, but he says he is happy Forest refused to sell. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a bit of speculation but my aim was to stay here,\u201d says Cash. \u201cThe club is going upwards and I see my future at Forest.\u201d\nNot least because he relishes working with Lamouchi. \u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant since the day he came in. He\u2019s very hard on me, which I need. In my new position he tells me every day what I need to do. The quality he\u2019s got in coaching as well as management is brilliant. He\u2019s very demanding and keeps everyone on their toes.\u201d\nLamouchi says after last week\u2019s defeat at Birmingham he was angrier than he has ever been with the players. \u201cI told some truths,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I say the truth to my kids.

In five spells across nearly 40 years as a player and manager, McCall and \n have seen and experienced almost every emotion together.\nThere has been euphoria, tragedy, desperation. Their relationship is so strong it was no surprise when the club on Tuesday asked McCall to become the manager for a third time, with Bradford just outside the \n play-off places following the dismissal of Gary Bowyer.\n\u201cIt was an opportunity to get back into the game, but it was an opportunity to be back among these people, and at this fantastic club,\u201d McCall says after finally navigating his way to a quiet room for a chat. \u201cI thought about it for all of two minutes before deciding.\u201d Given how his fourth spell at the club ended two years ago, though, you wondered whether there would be a fifth.\nMcCall guided Bradford to within a game of the Championship in 2017, \n, before being sacked the following January with the club again in the play-off places. During that spell he worked under Bradford\u2019s German owners, Stefan Rupp and Edin Rahic, with Rahic\u2019s desire to control all aspects of the football side now infamous in the city.\nRahic wanted to be involved with team selection. He dominated recruitment meetings and insisted McCall was referred to as head coach, rather than manager. After the sacking, a picture of McCall in the club\u2019s reception was taken down. \u201cWhat amazed me was we got as far as we did with everything that was going on,\u201d McCall says. \u201cIt became obvious Edin wanted to sack me after Wembley, so the writing was on the wall when we had a blip.\n\u201cAfter a couple of meetings before taking the job I got a grip of the situation, and it was unique. The stuff that was going on behind the scenes, I just accepted it. I knew what I was signing up for and if it wasn\u2019t Bradford, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. That summer, after the play-off final, I had nothing to do with recruitment as I thought I was leaving. But Edin didn\u2019t want the backlash from sacking me, and there was no way I was quitting on this club. So it came to a head really.\u201d\nBradford have never really recovered from McCall\u2019s sacking. In the two years he has been away from the club he calls his own, plenty has happened. Four managers have been and gone and the club were relegated to League Two last season but, crucially, Rahic has gone, with the former chief executive Julian Rhodes helping to steady the ship as interim CEO.\nMcCall has also been busy rebuilding his coaching career, but a tumultuous spell at Scunthorpe last year almost finished him. \u201cThe Scunthorpe experience stung me \u2013 leaving there with seven games left,\u201d he says. \u201cIt left me raw and disillusioned with the game for the first time as a manager. But Bradford \u2026 coming back here shakes all that off.\u201d\nAfter 460 games for Bradford as a player, and now joining people such as Martin Allen, Graham Westley and his old Everton manager Howard Kendall in managing the same club three or more times, there is a bond that runs deep. Two promotions \u2013 including one to the Premier League in 1999 \u2013 as a player have strengthened that, but so too have events laced with tragedy.\nMcCall was on the field on Bradford\u2019s darkest day, when a fire at Valley Parade claimed the lives of 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln fans. Understandably, McCall does not want to discuss the events of 11 May 1985 but he says: \u201cI had eight wonderful years here to begin with that were intertwined with a horrendous tragedy. That bonds people together, and tightens your bond to the club.\u201d\nWherever McCall\u2019s career has taken him, he has tried to return to the city on the anniversary of the fire to remember, at a memorial in the city centre, those affected.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve missed two or three, and they were when I was away with Scotland or Rangers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing to do with it being a duty. You pay your respects. You see people afterwards in City Hall who were there that day and if it\u2019s giving them a bit of light to have a chat, then it\u2019s the natural thing. I will always be there whether I work here or not.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s League Two play-off final falls days after the 35th anniversary of the disaster. McCall and Bradford still aim for automatic promotion despite seven matches without a win before Saturday\u2019s home game against Grimsby. For everything McCall has achieved with Bradford, there is one thing missing: promotion as a manager. \u201cI\u2019d probably look back with regret if that never happened,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, but this could be a Championship club. There would be nobody happier than me if we were promoted: and not for myself, for the people of this city, who have experienced so much.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/manchester-united-file-complaint-against-sun-over-woodward-house-attack": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/manchester-united-file-complaint-against-sun-over-woodward-house-attack", "title": "Manchester United file complaint against Sun over Woodward house attack", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 21:01:00 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Club believe tabloid had advance notice of incident<br />\u2022 The Sun says it \u2018vigorously defends its right to report\u2019<p>Manchester United believe the Sun newspaper had \u201cadvance notice\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/fans-attack-home-ed-woodward-manchester-united\" title=\"\">the attack on the house of Ed Woodward</a> and have filed a complaint to Ipso, the media watchdog.</p><p>The incident occurred on 28 January, when a group wearing balaclavas launched flares at the Cheshire home of the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman.

The quality of the images accompanying the story indicate that a photographer was also present.

They are in the relegation zone following five games without a win \u2013 a spell that has also seen them \n \u2013 with hopes of things getting better soon looking bleak given they visit Manchester City on Sunday before a trip to Liverpool after the winter break. On top of that there has been supporter unrest against the board, with a protest involving banners and black balloons planned for the match at Anfield.\nFew could blame Rice, then, if he were considering leaving West Ham despite having signed a long-term contract extension less than 14 months ago with the club he joined at academy level. Moyes accepts it is possible Rice could be sold but hopes it does not prove the case given the England international\u2019s importance to the side, in the short- and long-term.\n\u201cIn my mind he is arguably the best holding midfield player in the country and the best thing about Declan is he will get better,\u201d said Moyes, who also worked with Rice during his first spell as West Ham manager. \u201cDeclan is carrying a lot of the team at the moment and he\u2019s the one who will carry on from Mark Noble when it comes to an end for him.\n\u201cQuite often when building a club you have to sell.

It\u2019s always a problem. But it is what it is.

I don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, we\u2019ll prepare as best we can and try to reduce the gap.\n\u201cWhen we had 100 points they were 25 points behind, then one point [last season] and now look at them.

I don\u2019t have any [reason] to say there was something wrong with my players. I know they want to score goals and score the penalties. Honestly, we concede few against the big clubs and create a lot. We miss a lot of chances. They [the opponents] arrive once or twice and score \u2013 we have to improve on that. We can do more. Putting the ball in the net is the most difficult thing in football and we are going to try to improve.\u201d\nLeroy San\u00e9\u2019s recovery from a serious knee injury, meanwhile, may take \u201cweeks\u201d despite him being back in training with the squad.\n\u201cWhen you have an injury, especially this one for six months, you need to recover tempo and rhythm,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cHe needs time, it\u2019s not a case of him training and he will then immediately be there, it\u2019s not like an ankle or muscular injury. He needs weeks. What\u2019s important is that the surgery was perfect and he\u2019s recovering incredibly well.

Their key observation in the interim report is that safe standing \u201chas had a positive impact on spectator safety, particularly in mitigating the risk of crowd collapse.\u201d\nThe SGSA also observe that safe standing has not caused tension between supporters or between supporters and stewards. \u201cThere has been very little conflict as a result of standing,\u201d it said.\nWhile the findings are still provisional, they have met with approval from the government Every political party endorsed the idea of safe standing in their manifestos during last year\u2019s election and the sports minister Nigel Adams reinforced that view in light of the report.\n\u201cI welcome the latest findings from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority\u2019s research. As we made clear in our election manifesto, we will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing at football grounds.\n\u201cHowever it is imperative that football remains as safe as it has become over the past 25 years. Robust evidence that this change will provide equivalent or improved safety for supporters, will be absolutely paramount to this process.\n\u201cThere is more work that needs to be done. The SGSA is continuing to gather evidence over the course of this season, and I have asked them to work with the football authorities to consider next steps as we work with clubs and fans to introduce safe standing.\u201d\n which followed the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989. Since 1994 all clubs in the Premier League and Championship have been obliged to have all-seater stadia.\nStanding is possible in Leagues One and Two, where traditional terracing still remains at many grounds. The trials observed by the SGSA involve one particular type of standing arrangement, rail seating, which involve seats that can be folded away to allow standing and form a barrier at each level of the ground.\nThe EFL commented on the SGSA report stating: \u201cThe EFL is encouraged by the direction of travel being taken on what remains an important issue for the League and its membership. Our position remains consistent in that EFL Clubs, across all three divisions, should be able to provide supporters with the matchday experience they want in accordance with the relevant safety requirements, whether it is sitting or standing in stadiums.\u201d\nThe SGSA\u2019s research will now continue until the end of the season. Should the final report prove positive, it could pave the way to the return of safe standing by the 2021-22 season.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/feb/05/tokyo-2020-organisers-seriously-worried-about-impact-of-coronavirus-on-olympics-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/feb/05/tokyo-2020-organisers-seriously-worried-about-impact-of-coronavirus-on-olympics-video", "title": "Tokyo 2020 organisers 'seriously worried' about impact of coronavirus on Olympics \u2013 video", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 12:47:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers fear that the coronavirus outbreak may begin to dampen enthusiasm for the Games as the 24 July date of the opening ceremonies approaches.

However, if the outcome of Thursday morning\u2019s pow-wow between the good and the great of the 20 member clubs is anything to go by, the reality is far more prosaic and mundane.\nIt is not often the Premier League members vote for any wheeze that is not entirely in their own interests, but they are prone to the occasional rick. Their wheeze to close the past two summer transfer windows prior to the start of the season proved a grave misstep, as it gave their European rivals an extra three weeks to shamelessly court, unsettle and plunder their players, leaving squads full of holes they couldn\u2019t fill. It is an error they have \n, deciding to once again fall in line with the rest of Europe (as the country they represent falls out) and move this year\u2019s closing date back to 1 September.\n\u201cOne of the reasons is because the immigration system is going to change and it may be that it\u2019s the last window where freedom of movement is possible,\u201d cheered Premier League chief suit Richard Masters. \u201cClubs may want to take advantage of the longer window to make sure that they\u2019ve taken full advantage.\u201d Any changes to the immigration system will, of course, be prompted by the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union which, while \u201cdone\u201d in the Tory sense of the word, remains so hopelessly up in the air that nobody yet knows how it will affect football transfers. While many of the more vocal and patriotic Union Jack-wavers among the fanbases of assorted clubs may be delighted that Boris Johnson and his cronies have succeeded in \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it remains to be seen how thrilled they\u2019ll be when they discover their team has been stymied in its attempt to sign some midfield schemer from Portugal or Germany because their CV doesn\u2019t tick the requisite boxes required for them to secure a work permit.\nAnd while that Chelsea fan who gatecrashed a live Irish news report to raucously eff and jeff his support for both his football team and the UK\u2019s withdrawal in Parliament Square last Friday might argue these restrictions would only apply to players who aren\u2019t much good, they would be wrong. Had he required one, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is just one of several hundred European players in English football\u2019s top two tiers who wouldn\u2019t have had enough international caps to qualify for a work permit before moving to England. One shudders to think how Chelsea would have fared in recent years without him.\n\u201cWe have identified inaccuracies in the translation of Sky Sports News\u2019 interview with Alfredo Morelos. We apologise to both football clubs as well as Alfredo Morelos for the issues caused by these errors. After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future.

Anyhow, the Queen\u2019s Celtic have responded by lodging a complaint with Ofcom and publishing said letter in full.\n\u201cContinuing the thread of pre-match music (Fiver letters passim), I remember going to see the original Wimbledon playing my team, Stockport County, and listening to the DJ discussing how he had thought long and hard about the music to play to show empathy to Chelsea who had suffered a defeat that week in Big Cup. And then he played the \u2018chorus\u2019 of \n\u201d \u2013 Brian Ross.\n\u201cOnce went to a pre-season friendly between Leamington and Leicester.

Happily, that is often the best kind of all.\nIn February 1838 some 300 people congregated on the Harewood House fishpond, just outside Leeds, to see Harewood score a remarkable 447 runs, with Hugh Barrett at one point scoring 13 with a single shot.\n\u201cThe pond is 48 acres, and the ice that day was as smooth as glass,\u201d Barrett later recalled. \u201cWe had a board for the wicket, with bails on the top, and fine sawdust strewn all about the wickets and the 22 yards.\u201d\nAt stumps their opponents, the neighbouring Stank CC, were on 213 for four, with Holdsworth on 93 not out and the game due to resume the following morning, but an overnight thaw ensured there would be no more play on the fishpond that winter.\nIn early 1867 Robert Carpenter, one of the great batsmen of his age, starred in a match played in far from ideal conditions in Cambridge. \u201cSome part of the ground, or rather the ice, was covered with water, and a genius proposed to make a hole to draw it off,\u201d reported the Sportsman. \u201cOf course the proposal had the contrary effect, the weight of the skaters causing the water to pump up from the breakage.\n\u201cDoubts were now entertained by many as to the match being played, but, nothing daunted, the game was commenced in a fair inch of slush, some parts of the ice looking very much like sodden lump sugar.\u201d (That day\u2019s paper also contains a news story about \u201can ordinary-sized orange\u201d purchased in Dundee that contained \u201canother orange of a smaller size inside, perfectly formed\u201d.)\nA couple of weeks earlier (it sounds like a cold month) many of the great figures of Nottinghamshire\u2019s early years were involved in a game played entirely on skates. Jemmy Grundy, who represented the county for more than 20 years \u2013 playing his final first-class fixture in 1873, the year he died of gout aged 49 \u2013 organised (not very well) and played (only slightly better).\n\u201cWith the usual amount of blunder at the ball, owing to all using skates, the game proceeded merrily for an innings each,\u201d wrote the Nottingham Journal, \u201cthe only interference being that several of the numerous bystanders kept fielding the ball, and on the second innings being commenced many began sliding near the wicket, and the game had consequently to be abandoned.\u201d\nCharley Brown was on the other side and, according to the Sporting Life, he \u201ckept the players and spectators (of whom there were many) in very good humour, by his rough but lively jokes\u201d. Brown, commonly known as Mad Charley, was a genuine one-off, a wicketkeeper who could bowl, fast and accurate, by whipping his right arm behind his back to propel the ball from somewhere near his left armpit. His hands were said to be so swift that sometimes, when the ball narrowly missed the stumps, he could flick off a bail without anyone seeing a thing.\nBrown was a dyer by trade, but his employers found \u2013 according to his former teammate Richard Daft \u2013 that when cricket was discussed at work \u201cCharley got so excited that he would splash a lot of his dye into the tub of his fellow workman, whose cloth in consequence would come out a most remarkable colour\u201d. He was eventually told that he had to give up either his cricket or his job, and dumped the job.\nIn January 1880 Swansea and Cadoxton played on a frozen pond near Neath; Swansea were soundly beaten, and one member of the victorious team earned particular praise for his fielding: \u201cNot less remarkable than a cricket match on skates is the participation by a retriever in the game,\u201d read one report, which noted that Cadoxton \u201cwere much assisted by the admirable fielding of their canine comrade\u201d (Bob the Retriever appears on the scorecard as their No 11; he was dismissed without scoring).\nOn New Year\u2019s Day 1929 the journalist and writer JC Squire organised a game at Hambleton between his literary team, the Invalids, and one called the Hampshire Eskimos, in protest at the idea of football being played in August. Play was disrupted for a while by the Hambleton Hounds, who passed across the wicket while on a fox hunt.\nThe Athletic News cricket correspondent, an ex-player known cryptically as the Gentleman in Black, was a particular fan of ice cricket. \u201cMy experience of such events is that play generally proceeds in an unbroken roar of laughter, for in no other phase of the game is \u2018the glorious uncertainty of cricket\u2019 so much in evidence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFieldsmen, without the slightest warning or intention, are apt to stand suddenly on their head; a bowler, when delivering, is almost as likely as not to arrive before the ball at the striker\u2019s wicket; and the efforts of the batsmen to turn in an attempt to gain a second run for a hit are generally mirth-provoking.\n\u201cMatches in the depths of winter may not appeal much to our leading critics, yet they involve plenty of exercise for the players, provide fresh air for the lookers-on, who might otherwise be at home studying their favourite classics in a stuffy atmosphere, and \u2013 last, but by no means least \u2013 they give one an excellent opportunity of meeting old friends.\u201d\nYet, despite all of that, ice cricket has all but disappeared from Britain. Perhaps it\u2019s because public interest has cooled, perhaps because the climate has warmed, most likely a combination of the two, but these days anyone tired of studying their favourite classics in a stuffy atmosphere has little choice but to look to St Moritz instead.\n \n.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/footballers-who-share-their-names-with-film-titles-redux": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/footballers-who-share-their-names-with-film-titles-redux", "title": "Footballers who share their names with film titles redux | The Knowledge", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:14:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Plus: long-distance city namesake teammates, poor old Jon Macken, back-to-back Basque bosses and more</p><ul><li><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></li></ul><p><strong>\u201cPort Vale striker Leon Constantine appears to share his name with the titles of two films.

He even has a referee in the shape of \n \nThe 1972 rat-based horror \n, according to Peter McIntyre, sets up some potentials: \n (Inter Miami) among them. From this we can get Ben \n (Watford) and Ben \n (Norwich City). \nTim Postins kicks things along. \u201c\n \n (goalkeeper at Exeter City) is a mix of an absolutely awful 1996 Francis Ford Coppola comedy starring Robin Williams and a slightly less awful 1981 Dudley Moore comedy that won two Oscars,\u201d he writes. \u201cEverton striker \n \n is a mash-up of the 2009 movie starring Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried and the slightly obscure 1981 drama Kelly. \n \n (Leiston) and \n \n (Brisbane Roar) also qualify, but just to be flash, here\u2019s a three-fer. If you take 2015 indie sci-fi thriller \n, Colin Farrell\u2019s ridiculous \u2018epic\u2019 \n and the 1973 Roddy MacDowell-starring black comedy \n \u2026 well, I\u2019m sure you can work it out.\u201d\nAnd Robin Clarke goes off on a tangent. \u201cThe question reminded me of another one about seeing things in the classified results,\u201d he begins. \u201cOn Wednesday 24 February 2016 Derby County beat Blackburn Rovers \n. The scorer was \n.\u201d\n asks Andrew Newton.\n \u201cLyon have a couple of good candidates,\u201d reckons Russell Yong. \u201cMemphis (Depay), Tennessee, is 15,622km from (Jeff Reine-) Adelaide. However, the only combination that beats Melbourne-Coventry was created when they signed Bruno Guimar\u00e3es last week; Guimaraes, Portugal, is 17,041km from Adelaide, Australia.\u201d Interestingly, Lyon\u2019s signing deprives Brazil\u2019s Club Athletico Paranaense of a 19,758km pairing, of Guimar\u00e3es alongside Wellington. Russell has more, though. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to fit the criterion of actual cities. Yeovil\u2019s (Courtney) Duffus is 18,162km from (Stuart) Nelson, New Zealand, but Duffus is a village (outside Elgin, Scotland) rather than a city. Similarly, Athletico Paranaense\u2019s Wellington \u2013 again \u2013 is 18,369km from Lucas Halter, a hamlet of Visbek, Germany. We could have had Palmeiras\u2019s Nino (El Nino being a suburb of Murcia, Spain) 19,521km from Wellington (Silva), but alas, the latter was loaned to Internacional earlier this season.\u201d\n Graeme Atkinson pipes up with \u201c(Sammy) Nelson and (Alan) Sunderland (teammates in the 70s and 80s at Arsenal)\u201d.\nAlas, we\u2019re not taking Dwayne Mars playing alongside Louis Moss in a 2011 World Cup qualifier for Barbados (Liam McGuigan) or 1999-2000 Ipswich teammates Mark Venus, Jamie Clapham, Matt Holland and Mick Stockwell\n(Graeme again).\n recalls Benjie Goodhart. \nNot quite, but there\u2019s definitely some embarrassment in this old favourite. \u201cNicky Weaver once replaced former USA international midfielder Claudio Reyna for Manchester City in the Premier League,\u201d recalls John Morgan. \u201cCity were playing Middlesbrough and needed a win to clinch a Uefa Cup place on the last day of the 2004-05 season. Manager Stuart Pearce decided David James would be an effective target man, and brought Weaver on in place of Reyna, \n in an outfield shirt bearing the No 1. James didn\u2019t score, but contrived to cause enough panic that City won an injury-time penalty for a Franck Queudrue handball \u2026 only for Robbie Fowler to miss and blow City\u2019s chance. The only person feeling worse in the entire ground must have been Jon Macken \u2013 a centre forward, one-time record City signing and unused sub watching the farce from the dugout.\u201d\n notes Oliver Farry. \n\u201cCypriot club AEK Larnaca replaced Imanol Idiakez with Athletic Club legend, Andoni Iraola,\u201d tweets GIoryHornet. \u201cThey then rehired Idiakez after sacking Iraola.\u201d\n wondered Justin Horton in 2014.\n were not the only ones to make some foolish promises in the heat of the moment. \u201cBBC WM presenter Paul Franks said \n\u201d reported Paul Waterfield. \u201cHe did it in the mankiest pair of underpants imaginable.\u201d \n\u201cI seem to remember Rodney Marsh, working as a TV pundit, made one that Bradford City would be relegated from the Premier League in their first season in it,\u201d recalled David Smith. \u201cThey stayed up improbably by beating Liverpool in their last game, and I believe Marsh fronted up at Valley Parade to have his head shaved to honour his bet.\u201d This would not be the last time that Marsh would make a rash promise. In 2013 \n: \u201cIf #Stoke are ever the 1st match on MOTD I will drive to Stoke & personally clean every players\u2019 boots\u201d. Days later, \n ensured Marsh was on his way to Stoke with sponge in hand. The former Manchester City man turned up at the club\u2019s training ground but some players turned their backs. \u201c\u2018I will clean my own boots,\u201d said Charlie Adam, \u201che will be too embarrassed to clean them.\u201d The clean boots were signed and auctioned for the Donna Louise Children\u2019s Hospice.\n\u201cHas a player ever picked up an injury during a medical?\u201d asks David McCarville.\n\u201cMark Walters\u2019 middle name is Everton, despite playing umpteen times for Liverpool,\u201d explains Alex Gowing. \u201cDoes any other footballer have a name (first, middle or surname) which was a direct rival of a club they played for?\u201d\n\u201cNigel Pearson looks to have revived Watford,\u201d begins Mike Tomkins. \u201cI discovered he was the boss when Jimmy Glass saved Carlisle in 1999; nine years later and he helped save Southampton from relegation to League One at the expense of future employers Leicester. Of course he went on to famously save the Foxes the season before they won the Premier League. And he was the assistant manager when West Brom beat the drop in 2005. Has any manager been involved in more great escapes?\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit", "title": "David Squires on \u2026 what football can expect in the aftermath of Brexit", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 10:48:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our cartoonist takes a look at the sunlit uplands that are doubtlessly in store for football after Brexit</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/david-squires/products/what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit\">Buy a copy of this cartoon in the Guardian print shop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/david-squires-on\">Take a look through David\u2019s archive of cartoons</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/04/david-squires-on-what-football-can-expect-in-the-aftermath-of-brexit\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/04/golden-goal-clive-allen-qpr-v-west-ham-1984": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/04/golden-goal-clive-allen-qpr-v-west-ham-1984", "title": "Golden Goal: Clive Allen for QPR v West Ham (1984) | Rob Smyth", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 12:30:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>Allen\u2019s triple drag-back at a muddy Upton Park was the kind of instinctive brilliance that belonged on the Copacabana</p><p>For much of her glorious acting career, Edie Falco had a secret: she didn\u2019t know what she was doing.

It all stemmed from her time at college, when she was surrounded by polished students who could articulate what made for great acting. But Falco was the only one who could produce it.\nAfter sustained success, \n, Falco became comfortable with the fact that, \n: \u201cThere\u2019s certain people who know how to act from a more intrinsic level than an intellectual one.\u201d Probably more than she realises.\nThe principle applies to almost all professional creativity. Those who can, do. But most of them couldn\u2019t teach even if they wanted to. It\u2019s rare to find somebody who is equally accomplished in theory and practice. The great performers usually rely on something else \u2013 an instinct which, at its best, verges on the supernatural.\nTake the example of everyone\u2019s favourite improv theatre: association football. It is analysed like never before, but most of the really good stuff, the Emmy-winning stuff, remains almost impossible to articulate. Ask anybody who has produced a moment of individual brilliance and the chances are they will struggle to explain why or sometimes even how they did it.\nDennis Bergkamp, Kevin De Bruyne, Lionel Messi, Ryan Giggs and \u2013 if you want examples from a different sport \u2013 Ben Stokes and Michael van Gerwen are among the thousands of greats who attest to the importance of instinct. There\u2019s no I in team, but there are plenty in individual \u2013 and in instinct, improvisation, imagination and ingenuity. And every team benefits from the successful demonstration of those.\nQPR were certainly grateful when Clive Allen went on impromptu zigzag through the West Ham defence in 1984. It belongs to a subgenre of solo goal, in which a player abracadabras himself from a space the size of a phonebox through a combination of skill and improvisation. (\n.) But it shares the same quality as 99% of all solo goals: the I-word. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed me to do it.\u201d\nAllen, like all great goalscorers, spent his career trying to find space. That generally involved running on to the ball rather than trying to manufacture it while in possession. But he did a nice sideline in goals that involved the sort of imagination and spatial awareness associated with hipster darlings. Bergkamp or Dimitar Berbatov would have been very happy to score \n, and they would have loved the one at Upton Park.\nIt started with the mundane act of stretching away from goal to control Mike Fillery\u2019s cross, while trying to keep his balance on the muddy surface. Allen turned just outside the D and stopped to front up Billy Bonds, the West Ham captain. Bonds was leaning towards him like a sumo wrestler, waiting for the signal to engage. Their brief stand-off was interrupted when Neil Orr, appearing to Allen\u2019s right, decided to stick his surname in. As he approached, Allen dragged his studs over the ball to move it slightly away from goal, thus partially shielding it from Orr and buying himself a split-second to work out what to do next.\nAllen\u2019s instinct told him to drag the ball again, this time to move it completely away from Orr. As he did so, Bonds saw his chance and lunged optimistically towards the ball. Before he got there, Allen produced a third drag-back to take him out of the game. Orr, meanwhile, was transfixed just outside the area, engaging in a ferocious internal debate as to what day it was.\n\u201cAfter the second drag-back I still had my back to goal, so I had to move it again,\u201d says Allen. \u201cThat\u2019s why I did another drag-back. Each touch led to the next one.\u201d\nOne at a time. It\u2019s the footballer\u2019s cliche, usually used for taking each game as it comes. But most individual goals are created one step \u2013 or, in Allen\u2019s case, one drag-back \u2013 at a time. There\u2019s no bigger picture, no bird\u2019s-eye view or medium-term planning. It\u2019s like an arcade adventure game, where your only concern is to avoid being zapped by the nearest defender.\nFor all Allen\u2019s eye-catching drag-backs, the best touch might be the one that followed, an instant push into the space in front of goal. \u201cThe ball actually got away from me a little,\u201d he says, \u201cand I had to stretch to finish it.\u201d\nThe weight of the touch was less important than the angle. Had it been any straighter, Alvin Martin would have been able to beat Allen to the loose ball. Instead he arrived a split-second after the striker, who guided the ball past Phil Parkes and into the bottom corner.\nThe finish was admirably clear-headed; most of us would have been so high on our own skill as to over-excitedly leather it into Row Q. It was a goal of unique brilliance, a Zorroish swish through the West Ham defence, and even more striking in the context of 1980s English football. \n.\nOne of the most memorable things about Allen\u2019s goal was his anti-celebration. He walked away, almost po-faced, with nary a hint of a smile. At first we assumed this was faux-nonchalance, the pose we all struck when we fluked a screamer in the park as kids. But it was actually because of the match situation.\nWest Ham had battered \n and should have led by much more than 2-0 when Allen scored. Allen\u2019s wasn\u2019t a consolation goal, as there were 14 minutes remaining, but at the time it probably felt like it. \u201cIt was because of the way the game had gone,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd maybe, in the moment, I didn\u2019t realise quite how good a goal it was. I didn\u2019t see it as a spectacular goal that I was gonna go crazy about. Now I look at it and think, yeah, the drag-backs were quite something.\u201d\nAllen \ncelebrate wildly when he scored a tap-in nine minutes later to give QPR an unlikely draw. He had missed much of the season, but the West Ham double came near the start of a brilliant run of 10 in 10 games. It had a huge impact both on him and his team. At the end of the season he made his England debut against Brazil in the Maracan\u00e3, and soon after moved to Spurs.\nAllen\u2019s goals also helped QPR to finish fifth in their first season after promotion to the first division. Had they won their last two games, they would have ended up in second. Fifth was still good enough for Europe, which was a shock to one journalist who had written at the start of the season: \u201cThe only way this lot will qualify for Europe is through the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d\nMuch was made of their \u201cmagic carpet\u201d \u2013 the plastic pitch that rubbed so many opposing teams up the wrong way. Many away sides in the old Second Division moaned about having to play on it, and that didn\u2019t change when QPR were promoted to the top flight. \u201cThe only difference,\u201d said their manager Terry Venables, \u201cwas that, being the First Division, we got a higher class of complaint.\u201d\nThey had a higher class of riposte as well. QPR won as many away games as any team that season, including the champions Liverpool. They could play on plastic and grass \u2013 or, as Allen showed at West Ham, on mud.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/xfl-relaunch-season-start-vince-mcmahon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/07/xfl-relaunch-season-start-vince-mcmahon", "title": "XFL relaunches and attempts to forget the 'sex, booze and sleaze' era", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:00:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>The NFL\u2019s would-be rival kicks off this weekend 19 years after its first incarnation imploded.

The New York Post claimed that rowdy fans turned a New York/New Jersey Hitmen game into a family-unfriendly carnival of \n.\nThe old XFL was a reminder that anything conceived as \u201csports entertainment\u201d risks being neither, with McMahon\u2019s wrestling connections more liability than asset.

Yet the season is short and after that finale, fans are forced to go cold turkey until the autumn. Talent, meanwhile, is wasted: with only 32 NFL franchises but \n high-level college teams, there is a deep pool of young players desperate for any opportunity, as well as older NFL discards looking for a route back.\nThat\u2019s the theory. But others have tried and failed, such as the United States Football League of the mid-80s, which imploded after pursuing an \n advocated by one of the team owners, Donald J Trump.\nMost recently, the Alliance of American Football \n last year and seduced Eminem \u2013 \u201callowing the players to actually fight would be key to league\u2019s success like hockey\u201d he \n \u2013 before hitting financial trouble and \nafter eight weeks by a saviour turned executioner.\nThere are two core ways for owners to make money: real-estate deals that increase franchise values and broadcast revenue. But start-up leagues tend to rent existing venues, and though the XFL will be live on ABC, Fox and Fox Sports as well as ESPN, no media company will shell out substantial rights payments until a sport can prove it attracts viewers. And the sport has particular costs: the sheer number of players \u2013 each XFL team has 52-man rosters \u2013 and its inherent injury risk, which means high medical expenses.\nWith XFL players earning \n, that amounts to nearly $3m per season per team in player salaries alone, before other expenses. A 10-week regular season means each team plays only five home games, and with season tickets as low as $100, attendances will not cover all costs.\nThe Alliance was doomed after racking up tens of millions of dollars in losses in only a few weeks, but McMahon is rich enough to ride out a similar scenario for a few seasons. Last year the 74-year-old chairman and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment \n of shares, presumably to fund his new venture.\nDavid Carter, an associate professor at the USC Marshall School of Business and a sports business consultant, thinks the XFL\u2019s capacity to spend more than it makes could be vital. \u201cOver the long haul, labour stability via collective bargaining agreements and valuable media contracts are the keys, and they go together. But in the near term, while those are among the primary considerations, so too is the ability to deficit spend while refining both the on-field product and the league\u2019s marketing,\u201d he says.\nTechnology and the gradual liberalisation of sports betting laws after a 2018 US Supreme Court decision also offer intriguing possibilities. Not for nothing were \n partnering with the AAF, which was developing an innovative mobile app.\nMcMahon has largely kept out of the spotlight so far, letting credible football figures such as XFL commissioner and CEO, Oliver Luck - father of Andrew, the retired Indianapolis Colts quarterback - do the talking. (The XFL did not respond to interview requests.) Teams are based in the Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Dallas, Houston, Washington, St Louis and Tampa markets. This represents one of the XFL\u2019s biggest gambles: that cities with NFL teams have an appetite for more football.\nThe exception is St Louis, where Rams \u2013 and Arsenal \u2013 owner Stan Kroenke outraged Missourians by moving the franchise to LA in 2016. The BattleHawks will play in the Rams\u2019 former home and sold more than 6,000 season tickets by early January, The Athletic \n.\n\u201cI do think it can be a local hit. The fact that we don\u2019t have an NFL team here benefits the BattleHawks,\u201d says Randy Karraker, a sports radio presenter. \u201cThere are a lot of people in St Louis that will not watch the NFL at all because of what Stan Kroenke and the league did to them in ripping the team from St Louis.\u201d\nPaul Voss, co-host of the BattleFan podcast, agrees that the Rams\u2019 acrimonious exit is driving some of the early buzz. \u201cWe have something to prove, that we\u2019re a good sports town, we support our teams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a hometown team to root for again.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/w-series-spreads-wings-second-season-motorsport-eight-races": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/06/w-series-spreads-wings-second-season-motorsport-eight-races", "title": "W Series motor racing spreads its wings after outstanding debut season | Giles Richards", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:47:47 GMT", "summary": "All-female series has already had a global impact, with the 2020 calendar expanded from six to eight races and 12 of the 18 drivers already announced coming from different countries<p>When the all-female W Series was announced in 2018 no one expected it to be smooth sailing.

Making waves in motorsport\u2019s boys\u2019 club was always rather the point. Yet few imagined the impact it would make. Going global in only its second season is remarkable.\nThis week the series was awarded the John Nicol Trophy at the British Racing and Sports Car Club awards, honouring the organisation considered to have made the most influential contribution to furthering motorsport. It joins the awards the series has already been given from the UK Guild of Motoring Writers for its services to motoring, and the Autosport Pioneering and Innovation award.\nQuite a haul after only one season. In its inaugural year the W Series consisted of six races, all taking place at meetings of the German Touring Car (DTM) championship in Europe, with 20 drivers competing. Britain\u2019s Jamie Chadwick took the title at the final race at Brands Hatch in August. At the opener in Hockenheim the number of females making their way to the W series paddock was notable. By Brands there was a huge swathe thronging the cars and drivers. That the series had been successful was impossible to ignore.\nCriticised as unnecessary segregation by some, the series has almost completely silenced its detractors. Last week the \nto the top eight drivers this season. The championship winner will receive 15. To be able to race in F1, 40 are required. It was a major validation of the championship and a huge step for W Series, whose aim is ultimately to help a woman driver reach F1.\nShortly before the FIA confirmed the points, the series announced that its 2020 calendar will consist of eight races. Six with DTM but, significantly, the final two to be held at the F1 meetings in the US and Mexico. From having a handful of women drivers competing at senior level worldwide three years ago to a 20-woman grid at an F1 race is extraordinary.\nLast year drivers such as Britain\u2019s Alice Powell, Fabienne Wohlwend of Liechtenstein and the American Sabr\u00e9 Cook acknowledged that it had revitalised careers halted though lack of cash. Not only will all three compete again in the W series in 2020 but they have all also secured drives in other championships this year.\u201d\nCook, who is 25 and from Colorado, was unequivocal. \u201cWhen W Series came along it was all or nothing for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt saved my driving career and has been a key thing in my life.\u201d\nCrucially she recognises the drivers are all part of a bigger picture, that of inspiring the next generation. \u201cI know a lot of young girls who are trying to figure out how to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the same way, there is not a direct path. W Series coming into the US and more young girls in the States seeing that it is viable will be huge, it will give them something to aim for.\u201d\nThe force behind the series is its chief executive, Catherine Bond Muir. There was a simple premise behind the plans she began making in 2016. \u201cI researched women in motorsports and I was taken aback at how few there had been. It seemed to be something that was so iniquitous and frankly such an obvious wrong that it needed to be corrected.\u201d\nThe series\u2019s success has not happened in a vacuum. Women\u2019s football, rugby and cricket have seen exponential increases in popularity in the past decade, attracting a young audience not bound to the tired shackles of preconception. Those sports have generated a momentum that now seems inexorable.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s perception of women\u2019s sport has changed significantly in the last three years,\u201d Bond Muir added. \u201cThe first evidence was the women\u2019s World Cup, when people were talking about watching \u2018the football\u2019 not \u2018the women\u2019s football\u2019. I feel people are like that with W Series, that it has cracking racing and is entertaining, but that we are not solely defined by being a women\u2019s series.\u201d\nCook is eagerly anticipating her home race at the Circuit of the Americas, and the increase in races also reflects the international feel of the W Series. This season 18 of the 20 drivers have already been selected. They represent 12 nationalities, a range both healthy and vital in providing inspiration across the globe. Without W Series covering all the costs it is impossible to imagine such a range having such a platform.\nThere is a long way to go but as attention turns to F1 car launches next week, in the background the W Series will continue building towards making a difference and ensuring it makes its mark in the US and Mexico.\n\u201cIt is about promoting women to fulfil their potential and show the world what they are capable off,\u201d Bond Muir said. \u201cIf we can help women around the world achieve that, well, I don\u2019t want to appear arrogant but I think we can have an impact right across the world.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/lionel-messi-barcelona-eric-abidal-patience-snapped": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/lionel-messi-barcelona-eric-abidal-patience-snapped", "title": "The blame game: how Lionel Messi\u2019s patience finally snapped at Barcelona", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:19:25 GMT", "summary": "Barcelona are in a mess and Eric Abidal\u2019s comments that the players were to blame was simply too much for the Argentinian<p>Quique Seti\u00e9n scoffed and then started laughing. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said.

The club\u2019s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, spoke to Eric Abidal and Lionel Messi on Wednesday, desperate to restore calm. After a long meeting, the decision was made to stick with Abidal.\nThe day before \n, it was confirmed Luis Su\u00e1rez needed an operation and would be out for three or four months. They sold two strikers, Carles P\u00e9rez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make space for another but, having briefed that it was all tied up, they failed to sign one. Carles Ale\u00f1\u00e1 had gone too, and Jean-Clair Todibo, and Moussa Wagu\u00e9, but still they had not raised enough. No matter, Seti\u00e9n said, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 would be the \u201csigning\u201d: he was on his way back to full fitness and would be \u201cflying\u201d. Then the news broke that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had torn a tendon in his thigh and would miss the rest of the season.\nThe squad are weaker, not stronger, than when Seti\u00e9n arrived; this is not what he was sold. On Wednesday morning only 16 first\u2011team players were named to travel to face Athletic in Bilbao \u2013 and that is everyone they have got. Samuel Umtiti would have to make his own way there: he was wanted in court in the morning, accused of doing almost \u00a3170,000 worth of damage to a flat he was renting. At the weekend, Ivan Rakitic admitted he was unhappy at how Barcelona had tried to force him out. Arturo Vidal\u2019s agents had already begun legal proceedings over a disputed bonus.\nAnd then, as if all that was not enough, on Tuesday night Abidal gave an interview to Sport. In it, he said he was optimistic Messi would sign a new deal and that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s star player was happy at Camp Nou. But what he said in response to that question was eclipsed by what he said in response to others, which in turn changed the veracity of that statement.\nAbidal had suggested some of Barcelona\u2019s players had been \u201cunsatisfied\u201d with the former manager Ernesto Valverde \u2013 \n, in other words. He also said they did not \u201cwork much\u201d. For Messi, long assumed to wield power, the heaviest of dressing\u2011room heavyweights and invariably burdened with responsibility, the accusation was intolerable. It took less than 90 minutes from the first brief advance of the interview going live for Messi to react: it was public and unequivocal, the division and resentment exposed.\nOn Messi\u2019s Instagram account a red circle was drawn around the quote: \u201cLots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much.\u201d Below it, Messi demanded Abidal take responsibility for his actions, accusing him of \u201cdirtying\u201d the players and challenging the sporting director to name names. Messi takes more responsibility than he should; he was not going to take this one, too. Many thought he was right and even those who thought Abidal might be did not consider it a good idea to say so. The damage was done and it awoke the greatest fear: Messi leaving.\nMessi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave at the end of the season \u2013 and for free. As Abidal admitted, all he has to do is communicate that in May. The 32-year-old has said repeatedly he wants to finish his career at Barcelona but has also said he wants to compete and over the past five years he has felt increasingly like Bar\u00e7a do not. Nor does he have long left: at December\u2019s \n for the first time he raised the question of retirement. There is a growing feeling his final years are being wasted and Messi is not immune to that feeling.\nMessi has not won the European Cup for five years. He has watched Barcelona fail to build around him \u2013 whether he is part of that problem is a broader, more complex question \u2013 and seen a generation slip into retirement and not be replaced. He has seen a lack of direction and certainty, four directors of sport and endless advisers under this regime. He has seen the president become vice-president as well and the team become weaker, despite spending \u20ac1,000m since the departure of Neymar. And now this. No wonder he snapped.\nMessi\u2019s response does not come in isolation: there have been small signs of distrust everywhere, glimpses of the divisions opening up, and not just from him. This is the player who stalled on posing for a photo with the president after his last contract renewal, as if reluctant to legitimise him; the player who said the director Javier Faus, who had suggested there was no reason why Messi should get a new contract every year, \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything about football\u201d; who saw his friend Dani Alves suggest that, by leaving, he had delivered a deserved and \u201cclassy blow\u201d to the board.\nSince Neymar left there has been a sense of the club reaching for something that has gone, desperate for a solution that never arrives. The only solution, it often felt, was Messi. He was a shield behind which many hid, a reason for complacency, conditioning everything. He wanted to share that burden, have a team constructed around him. Instead, he must have wondered what else he had to do, why it always seemed to come down to him. In the last few weeks even his best friend Su\u00e1rez has been absent, with Messi cutting an even lonelier figure.\nThis summer Messi watched his other great friend Neymar and Barcelona end up in court, even while they spent the summer supposedly courting each other. And then said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the club did everything they could to sign him.\u201d Messi wanted Neymar but he didn\u2019t get that wish, however much they say he runs the place. The irony of course is that if the response is to sack Abidal, which it might be if only because the alternative is so awful, another short-term fix, it would reinforce the idea Messi is all powerful. Another fire to put out, sparked by Abidal\u2019s hint that player power was too great.\nThere is no player like Messi; his reaction, at least, illustrates he felt the finger pointing at him and was not prepared to let it go. He asked for names: maybe some were not happy, maybe some were not working but do not look at me. And do not hide behind me, either. He has enough responsibility already to take on other people\u2019s errors as his own, to be made a participant of the problems piling up since Seti\u00e9n arrived and well beyond that, failure delivered to his doorstep again. Above all, to be blamed for this mess.\nThe AS journalist Santi Gim\u00e9nez on Wednesday offered a simple response to the accusation Messi runs Barcelona: if only.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/premier-league-winter-break-prime-content": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/premier-league-winter-break-prime-content", "title": "Who needs football when Premier League winter break provides prime content? | Marina Hyde", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 14:48:44 GMT", "summary": "The hiatus enables clubs to focus on their football-adjacent core functions \u2013 in association with official partners, of course<p>I cannot think of a more ideal innovation in the Premier League\u2019s consciously uncoupled relationship with football than the winter break.

A very small section of people really do care about those things, of course, which is why there is a very small amount of content among the vast tumult of football content to cater to them. But in the main, people would do anything to avoid this stuff.\nBy contrast, they \u2013 indeed, we \u2013 are unable stop talking about what might be termed football-adjacent matters. A huge part of being a football fan in keeping with the times is having well-aired views about things that are not football: people, money, all manner of social media dramas, the antics of a vast firmament of soap opera characters to hate, envy, occasionally even love \u2026 you know the sort of matters. The good thing for the content providers, as we now call the clubs, is those things are happening all week long. It\u2019s not just the odd 90-minutes here and there.\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with all that, you understand. But in this context the winter break is a stroke of absolute genius. It is a break from having to pretend to talk about football, because there is no football \u2013 only all the other, more popular football-adjacent stuff. Having said that, there is a small bit of football, it turns out \u2013 but that is far better discussed in terms of \n for it, as opposed to the actual football itself.\nI have hugely enjoyed the lengthy and lively coverage of the winter break kick-off on the various breakfast shows. I concede it might have been so vigorously discussed in part because it is a novelty. But my strong suspicion is that it was mainly embraced so enthusiastically because it freed everyone from even the pretence of having to discuss football.\nCertainly the absence of football has been remorselessly covered in all media outlets in the days and even weeks leading up to its temporary hiatus. You cannot move for sensational headlines seeking to put you inside the action of the lack of action. Even the headlines set my pulse racing. \u201cPremier League Winter Break Explained: What You Need to Know.\u201d \u201cArsenal\u2019s winter break UNCOVERED\u201d. \u201cHow does the Premier League\u2019s Winter Break Work?\u201d Well \u2026 I want to say that it\u2019s a break? Which happens in winter? But from everything I have managed to glean its mysteries would seem slightly more arcane than those of the Iowa caucus.\nEither way, top-flight football increasingly feels like a world in which football is a plot device \u2013 what Hitchcock called a MacGuffin. You need it for the story to happen, and to provoke the characters you care about into behaving in certain consumable ways \u2013 but in and of itself, it is relatively insignificant in the grand scheme. As Hitchcock explained it once: \u201cThe MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after but the audience don\u2019t care.\u201d Rather like the FA Cup. In advance of Liverpool\u2019s Tuesday night \n Town, there must have been at least three times as much chat and three times as many articles about J\u00fcrgen Klopp not breaking his winter break to attend it as there were about the game and build-up itself. You could luxuriate in coverage of the row about him not being there, of his pushback against the row, of the technical process via which he might watch the match in absentia and phone in during it, and all the descriptions of how his spirit had permeated the Anfield setup so totally that it would be almost like he was there.\nFor Manchester United, meanwhile, the winter break offers a chance to beef up off-pitch output, particularly in concert with their many official partners. Admittedly, the current travails of the club\u2019s official football partner are unfortunate \u2013 but the break will allow a focus on those United plotlines and content items that are doing much better. \n, for instance, or sponsor relations.\nIt\u2019s all just a slightly different kind of output in the great football-adjacent universe \u2013 like Big Band week on the X Factor, or a camping episode in a popular sitcom. It just means that rather than appearing in content beamed from Old Trafford, this week Fred is appearing in content beamed from the Maldives. Look \u2013 here is an Instagram snap of him shooting off a waterslide! Meanwhile, Victor Lindel\u00f6f is in Morocco! Other dramas? Rising tensions in the Middle East mean United\u2019s \n; rising tensions elsewhere mean Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r must use the time off to solve the fiendish puzzle of how to win more football games.\nWhat a wondrous lot of this stuff there is. If you find yourself at any point wondering whether any of it could technically ever be branded as \u201cfootball\u201d, please don\u2019t. Just relax. Submit. Let the content wash over you like a rainfall shower by Kohler, the principal bathware partner of Manchester United. Give yourself a break. No \u2013 give yourself a WINTER break.\n"}}, "Entertaniment & Arts": {"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/08/peter-carey-how-i-wrote-the-true-history-of-the-kelly-gang": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/08/peter-carey-how-i-wrote-the-true-history-of-the-kelly-gang", "title": "Peter Carey on True History of the Kelly Gang: \u2018At 56, I wrote what my younger self could not have managed\u2019", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 14:00:39 GMT", "summary": "<p>Thirty years after discovering an inspirational letter by bushranger Ned Kelly, Carey found the voice for his Booker prize-winning novel</p><p>In 1961 I failed my first-year science exams at Monash University in Melbourne.

I hope you see what I saw: Ned Kelly is on fire\nIn or about the spring of 1870 the ground was very soft a hawker named Mr Gould got his wagon bogged between Greta and my mother\u2019s house on the eleven mile creek, the ground was that rotten it would bog a duck in places.\u201d\nWhy had no one told me about this? Had no one else seen what I saw, that the famous bushranger was an avant-garde artist with hardly a comma to his name?\nI was still drunk on Joyce, and mad with ignorant ambition. I had read not very much. I had written one unpublished story but was not shy to think that I might write a novel that would transform everyone\u2019s idea of that bearded Australian bushranger. \u201cI dare not strike him,\u201d Kelly had written about Constable Hall, \u201cor my sureties would loose the bond money I used to trip him and let him take a mouth full of dust now and again as he was as helpless as a big guano after leaving a dead bullock or a horse. I threw big cowardly Hall on his belly I straddled him and rooted both spurs onto his thighs he roared like a big calf attacked by dogs and shifted several yards of the fence I got his hands at the back of his neck and trid to make him let the revolver.\u201d\nI did not fix the spelling. I did not add a comma. I transcribed the letter and carried it on my person like a holy cross. And yet my first novel shows none of Kelly\u2019s influence. Samuel Beckett took his place. When I lost the Jerilderie letter in a pub I did not bother to replace it.\nIt was over, so it seemed. I published nine novels without a nod to Kelly. I became old. I left Australia. I arrived in New York and then, just when my friends all feared I had left my country far behind, I wandered into the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and there they were: Nolan\u2019s magnificent Kelly paintings looking very good indeed. One by one, I brought my new Manhattan friends uptown and walked them around the 27 paintings as if they were the stations of the cross. I explained why, while we had no Thomas Jefferson, our imaginary founding father was a convicted murderer named Ned Kelly.\nThis was in 1994, exactly 30 years since I first read the Jerilderie letter. At 56, I sat down and wrote what my younger self could not have managed: \u201cI lost my own father at 12 yr. of age and know what it is to be raised on lies and silences my dear daughter you are presently too young to understand a word I write but this history is for you and will contain no single lie may I burn in Hell if I speak false\nMy thanks to all my publishers who did not try to add a single comma.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/kirk-douglas-ace-in-the-hole-best-role-journalism-films": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/kirk-douglas-ace-in-the-hole-best-role-journalism-films", "title": "Kirk Douglas: why his finest role was as a cynical newspaper hack", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 13:05:37 GMT", "summary": "The actor, who died last week, will go down in history as Spartacus, but<em> </em>his powerful performance in Billy Wilder\u2019s Ace in the Hole  should not be overlooked<p>The quiet newsroom of the Sun-Bulletin in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is just a temporary holding pen for Chuck Tatum, the restless and unprincipled reporter played by Kirk Douglas in the 1951 Hollywood classic, <em>Ace in the Hole</em>.

Inspired by the real-life press feeding frenzy that sprang up in 1925 when a man called \n, the plot has Tatum taking control of the scene of a mining disaster and working it to his own ends. Quickly establishing himself inside the filling station run by a trapped man\u2019s wife, the newshound twists the facts to suit his tale and shows no visible pangs of guilt. \u201cI\u2019ve met a lotta hard-boiled eggs in my life, but you, you\u2019re 20 minutes,\u201d the wife tells Tatum in grudging awe.\nAs the \n noted when Wilder\u2019s film was released on video in 2007, \u201cthere is not a wasted shot\u201d. But really it is the performance that Douglas gives that powers the action. His Tatum is a horribly convincing portrayal of an unsympathetic, tortured soul. The star \u201cis at his most uningratiatingly forceful in virtually every scene\u201d, judged Philip French in an appreciation of the film \n. He makes you believe you are watching a human being capable of anything.\nThe title of Wilder\u2019s film is taken from stud poker and refers to Tatum\u2019s search for the competitive edge in the ruthless game of selling news to the public. But the screenplay, co-written by the director with Walter Newman and Lesser Samuels, proved too gritty for general consumption, and the film failed on its first release during the \n in America. The movie studio tried again later, renaming it \n, but still it upset audience assumptions about what a good film should offer.\nThe press were not happy either. After all, what Douglas\u2019s reporter does is worse than even the lurid nightmares of a misused litigant in the British phone-hacking scandal. When Tatum discovers that the trapped man could be freed from the mineshaft in just two days, he finds an elaborate way to lengthen the process and so provide a better national spectacle.\nHis behaviour is beyond the pale for even a hardened Fleet Street hack, although his efforts to persuade the man\u2019s disaffected wife to pretend to be loyal are closer to the mark. In disreputable newsrooms, stories are still adjusted to fit the template of readers\u2019 expectations.\nWilder knew the newspaper business. He had worked on a series of popular titles in Vienna and Berlin in the 1920s. The only concession he made to the honour of his old trade is that \n is almost as hard on the public appetite for sensation and drama as it is on the workings of the press. The film is shot in black and white but its real triumph is its shades of grey. There is humanity and morality in the story, but not quite enough.\nTo watch Douglas here is to be reminded that just because a film was made 70 years ago it doesn\u2019t mean it was made in simpler times. And, \n, it is worth remembering that those films that endure are not always the ones to win early plaudits. The classics that go on to earn a place in people\u2019s hearts, or ultimately to be acclaimed by critics, often fall by the wayside in the initial awards goldrush.\nThe 1940 reworking of Ben Hecht\u2019s play \n stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as sparring reporters.\nAlan J Pakula\u2019s 1976 lodestar for all political thrillers, in which the \n\u2019s Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward unravel the truth about Watergate.\nGlenn Close\u2019s executive and Michael Keaton\u2019s news editor battle to keep the fictional New York Sun afloat in Ron Howard\u2019s 1994 comic requiem for the press.\n2016 Oscar-winning tribute to the real-life work of the \n newsroom exposes sex abuse in the Catholic church.\nMeryl Streep and Tom Hanks play owner and editor of the\n, who clash and then concur in this tense 2017 handling of another Washington scandal.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/08/jazz-dave-brubeck-band-take-five-rehearsal-tapes-bad-student-band": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/08/jazz-dave-brubeck-band-take-five-rehearsal-tapes-bad-student-band", "title": "Take one: lost Dave Brubeck tapes reveal jazz hit originally sounded like \u2018a bad student band\u2019", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 15:25:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>Rehearsal tapes show band struggling with the groove and rhythm of million-seller Take Five, claims new book</p><p>It is the best-selling jazz single of all time.

But previously unheard rehearsal tapes reveal that Dave Brubeck\u2019s Take Five might never have been such a hit if he had stuck with an original version.\nPhilip Clark, author of a forthcoming book on Brubeck, the American jazz legend, has for the first time gained access to 1959 recordings that had lain forgotten in a Californian archive until now.\nHe was taken aback to hear a completely different rhythmic groove and Brubeck\u2019s quartet struggling to make sense of it. \u201cIt sounds like a bad student jazz band,\u201d he said. \u201cMost notably, the fundamental rhythm is wrong. Nothing will knit together.\u201d Take Five was the first jazz single to hit a million sales and such is its enduring popularity that \n of a 1966 performance has had more than 10 million views. But Clark believes that had the band kept with the earlier version, \u201cTake Five would probably have disappeared\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different rhythmic feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all really struggle with it and it never really works. [Joe] Morello, who was a miraculous drummer, can hardly play it. He keeps tripping over it and he can\u2019t quite get it to fit into the groove.\n\u201c[Paul] Desmond is fiddling with the melody line, so there are bits where it\u2019s in a minor key and suddenly goes into the major, and the transitions aren\u2019t quite worked out. [Eugene] Wright is trying to work out his bass part, and Dave is desperately trying to glue the whole thing together. They try 12 times. Then Dave says let\u2019s do another tune.\n\u201cAfter that all the rehearsal tapes are lost, so we don\u2019t actually know what happened between the rehearsal and the rhythm we now know.\u201d\nMonths after the tapes were recorded, Take Five was released in an altogether different form.\nWhile the earlier version had been \u201cmuch more driving and faster\u201d with a lopsided Latin rhythm, this had a sexy 5/4 Take Five beat which \u201csits in the groove\u201d, said Clark.\n\u201cOom, chuck-a, chuck, boom, boom/Oom, chuck-a, chuck, boom, boom. No other instrumental jazz single has beaten its record. \n, the album on which Take Five appeared originally, went platinum in 2011, meaning sales of 2 million copies plus.\u201d he added.\nBrubeck, who died in 2012, was a pianist and composer who pushed jazz boundaries, experimenting with odd time signatures, improvised counterpoint, polyrhythm and polytonality.\nBut it is Desmond who is credited as Take Five\u2019s composer. The quartet playing it was made up of Brubeck on the piano, Desmond on alto saxophone, Morello on drums and Wright on double bass.\nClark understands that the Brubeck estate might at some future date release the newly unearthed tapes \u2013 which cover around three hours of \n rehearsals.\nIn a further twist, the Take Five recordings contradicted what Brubeck had told him in extensive interviews in 2003, Clark revealed.\n\u201cNinety per cent of what he told me about Take Five was completely undermined by the rehearsal tapes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe insisted that the famous Take Five rhythms were in place at the beginning. Then I listened to the rehearsal tapes and the rhythm they were working with originally was unrecognisable.\u201d\nBut he added that Brubeck had perhaps been misremembering a session that happened decades earlier.\nClark\u2019s book, \n, is published on 18 February. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/08/cold-war-steve-latest-show-cut-out-and-keep": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/08/cold-war-steve-latest-show-cut-out-and-keep", "title": "Why you can cut out and keep Cold War Steve\u2019s latest show", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 14:35:39 GMT", "summary": "The artist, whose satirical collages poke fun at politicians, has created a free  \u2018downloadable\u2019 exhibition for fans<p>Last year, it was the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, a neoclassical building set in glorious parkland and containing works by Dal\u00cd, Picasso and Mir\u00f3.

Even Hugh Grant had sworn off them, claiming he was \u201ctoo old and ugly\u201d, as movie studios abandoned dashes through airport security and beautiful but clumsy women tripping over pavement kerbs.\nBetween 1990 and 2002, the romcom, from \n (1993) to As Good As It Gets (1997) to My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), reigned supreme. A wave of women, including Meg Ryan, Reese Witherspoon, Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Lopez, were making us \u2013 and a rotating cast of square-jawed hunks \u2013 fall in love with them.\nBut the tide began to turn as the market became saturated with by-the-numbers movies that were missing the magic of their predecessors: forgettable dross such as Rumour Has It, Failure to Launch and Made of Honour (don\u2019t look up their \n scores). Audience numbers fell and studios moved on to epic fantasy franchises and building cinematic universes.\nSo the romantic comedy went undercover. It snuck into cinemas in the form of guy-centric grossouts from Judd Apatow, or indies such as \n, or even disguised as prestige musicals like La La Land. TV picked up the slack, with The Mindy Project, Lovesick and Jane the Virgin variously embracing, playing with or subverting the genre.\nExcept it turns out that the big, traditional romcom was not quite as lifeless as we thought. In 2018, \n declared a \u201csummer of love\u201d and embarked on a campaign to woo us back to joyously escapist and predictable schmaltz. It appears to have succeeded: the streaming giant reported that 80 million people watched at least one of its original romcoms in the following three months. Now it is set to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day with a sequel to breakout hit To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before (now with the gooey addendum P.S. I Still Love You).\nAnd if McConaughey thought he\u2019d had a renaissance, 2020 is shaping up to give romcoms the same, with a wealth of new releases slated to make us go weak at the knees. Among others, there is Love. Wedding. Repeat, starring Sam Claflin and Olivia Munn (Netflix bought the rights at Cannes), Marry Me, with old hands Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson, and a double offering from \n \u2013 she stars in The Photograph with Lakeith Stanfield and The Lovebirds with Kumail Nanjiani. Like its many star-crossed lovers, the romcom has made it against all the odds.\nAnd the odds were many, because romcoms are an easy target. Rubbished by critics as lightweight fluff, avoided by male audiences and mocked by wider pop culture, they went from bubbly box-office hits to guilty pleasures \u2013 something that their largely female fans were embarrassed to admit to liking. As Dr Deborah Jermyn, a reader in film and television at the University of Roehampton, says: \u201c[Romcoms have] always been held in low esteem. The association of romantic comedy for many years was that it\u2019s a \u2018women\u2019s genre\u2019 \u2013 that it\u2019s nothing to be taken seriously, it\u2019s trivial.\u201d Like \u201cchick-lit\u201d, romcoms have been afforded little cultural value because they not only played to women but put them front and centre. As Dr Jermyn says: \u201cYou get to hear women speak on screen for much longer than in other kinds of cinema.\u201d\nMartha Shearer, assistant professor in film studies at University College Dublin, says that the romcom\u2019s largely female audience is unfairly condescended to. \u201cThere are a lot of assumptions being made about the people who watch them \u2013 that they are dupes or can\u2019t see that genre films are conventional \u2013 in the way that the person making that criticism evidently can. It\u2019s a fundamentally elitist criticism,\u201d she says. \u201cMass female audiences are more than capable of responding to media texts critically at the same time as enjoying them.\u201d\nThe best romcoms are similarly cognisant of the genre\u2019s conventions. For a romcom to succeed, it has to be unashamedly sincere. Characters are required to believe in love and although they might come up against obstacles, they will overcome them. We know \u2013 because we know romcoms \u2013 that they will have a happy ending (although it might not be the one you thought).\nThe new raft of romantic comedies are unashamedly in this tradition. They are overblown, standing-on-the-cafeteria-table, public declarations of love to the genre. Beyond To All the Boys \u2026 there\u2019s gay high-school romcom Love, Simon; Set It Up, a snappy Netflix story about two overworked assistants setting up their demanding bosses only to fall for each other; and Always Be My Maybe, a funny, charming love story about actual grownups, played by Ali Wong and Randall Park.\nAlthough some have played in cinemas \u2013 such as mega-hit Crazy Rich Asians and Long Shot, with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogan \u2013 it is streaming where new romcoms have really rediscovered their mojo. It makes sense. When female fans in particular have relentlessly had their taste questioned, why not retreat to the safety of their own homes to watch without fear of ridicule? Streaming plays to all the strengths of romcom success: word-of-mouth buzz, rewatches, movie marathons. They do not require Imax viewing (a laptop screen will do just fine), and if you fall asleep in the middle, you will probably be able to pick things up pretty quickly.\nWhat all these films share is real affection and respect for the genre, their characters and the people watching them. They understand the necessary components for giving us exactly what we want, right down to the corny titles. When romcoms were a dime-a-dodgy-dozen in the later 00s, there was a tendency for studios to think their audiences were hooked by silliness and contrivance (eg Ghosts of Girlfriends Past), instead of the real attraction: human connection (albeit between outrageously good-looking people with beautiful homes and enormous wardrobes).\nAs the feminist writer and self-proclaimed romcom fanatic Roxane Gay has said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I believe love actually happens the way Hollywood pretends it does \u2026 I do, however, enjoy a good lie.\u201d She even suggests that gaping plot holes are essential, in order to distract us from how absurdly straightforward they make out love to be.\nBut even as the core elements remain, it is not all the same old same old. Along with the gendered snobbiness aimed at romcoms, there have also been plenty of fair critiques: it is true that they almost exclusively told white, wealthy, heterosexual stories. The considerable crop of successful black romcoms such as Love & Basketball or The Best Man were consigned to their cultural niche rather than welcomed into the canon. The new class of romcoms is attempting to give us considerably more diverse casts (including leads) as well as more inclusive non-heterosexual love stories such as Happiest Season, a Clea Duvall-directed lesbian romcom starring Kristen Stewart, and a still-untitled gay romcom written by and starring Billy Eichner and produced by Judd Apatow. And because romcoms demand happy endings, they are a space where minority stories can be told with hope and joy, something not always afforded them in mainstream prestige storytelling.\nThere are other changes, too, such as paying attention to power dynamics, body-shaming, sexual politics, toxic gender stereotyping and portrayals of consent (which the new To All the Boys sequel makes a clear point of addressing). In other words, we\u2019re unlikely to see remakes of Never Been Kissed, in which a high-school teacher cultivated a very problematic relationship with one of his students (crucially before he finds out she\u2019s actually a 25-year-old undercover journalist), and Shallow Hal, in which Jack Black can only be attracted to a fat woman if he\u2019s bewitched into thinking she looks like Gwyneth Paltrow (minus the fat suit). Of course not all the newcomers will be woke, or indeed even any good: Netflix\u2019s The Kissing Booth \u2013 a high-school love triangle in which possessive brothers both lay claim to a sweet, naive heroine \u2013 is a culprit of being both pretty rubbish and romanticising emotionally manipulative behaviour. Of course, it\u2019s getting a sequel.\nFilms like this and To All the Boys sit at the teen end of the spectrum \u2013 all high-school drama and first loves \u2013 but they are playing to Netflix\u2019s legions of young viewers. Many of those watching in 2020 will not have been old enough, or even born, the last time the genre was having a moment. Dr Jermyn says there is a good reason romcoms have such longevity: \u201cWhatever\u2019s going on in the world, if we\u2019re in a peak or a trough in terms of global politics, you can\u2019t really get away from the charm and the belief in the fact that people will meet and fall in love, whatever the circumstances. That\u2019s always going to keep driving it.\u201d\nThe world is a complicated place and a lot of people live under trying circumstances. It makes sense then that we would turn to the cynicism-free comfort of a romcom, a safe space for us to experience and express emotion, with limited peril. It is perhaps the one genre that truly understands the value of short-but-sweet, rarely coming in much over 100 minutes; in a market saturated by choice, this is not to be sniffed at. Good romcoms can see you through breakups, honeymoon periods, actual periods, hangovers, bad days and good days. They ring true to teenagers who have never even held hands, and to jaded romantics who think they have seen it all. What romcoms lacked in the Matthew McConaughey-leaning-against-a-succession-of-women era was an understanding that love \u2013 and all the meet-cutes, hijinks, misunderstandings, mistaken identities and heartache that come with it \u2013 doesn\u2019t only happen to straight, white people. Being formulaic isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing when the formula works; it\u2019s just some of the components that need an update.\nEveryone deserves to see themselves dating someone for a bet, having a snog in the rain and realising that maybe the right person was in front of them all along. It has been a bumpy old ride back to the top for romcoms, but then the course of true love never did run smoothly.\n This article was amended on 8 February 2020.

Luckily, there are plenty of options \u2026\nRemember the \n, where a bored woman on a flight eavesdropped on a burgeoning flirtation between two attractive strangers sitting in the seats in front of her? Remember how the woman being tweeted about was so appalled that she wrote a damning statement that made us all question our addiction to oversharing online? This deserves to be a Jordan Peele horror film. Melissa McCarthy to play the eavesdropper. Zak Efron and Vanessa Hudgens to play the couple.\nIn this \n, a woman recounts the time she accidentally went on an OkCupid date with a 97-year-old man. The date starts off weirdly, then gets sweet. And then, right at the end, finishes with full-blown horror. There might not be a market yet for films based on offers of nonagenarian cunnilingus, but that\u2019s only because nobody has had the guts to debut one yet. Naomi Scott to play the girl, Robert Redford to play the old man. Sam Taylor-Johnson to direct.\nIn arguably \n, an unseen hand squeezes a rubber duck in a supermarket. It quacks. Then he squeezes an entire binful of rubber ducks, and they roar like a bloodthirsty invading army. There is so much story potential here that it\u2019s ridiculous. Where did the ducks come from? What made them so angry? Why were they lying in wait in a supermarket? Was it an ambush? This will be a big-budget DreamWorks animation. Mel Gibson to voice all the ducks.\nIn 2015, a video of the \n went viral. The US woman was arguing with restaurant workers who had apparently put green peppers on her kebab because \u201cmy children don\u2019t eat green things\u201d. She launched into a racist tirade about the workers, before screaming: \u201cThis is America! You get it right the first time!\u201d over and over again. And then, as she left, she banged her head on the door. I propose a Mr Bean-style movie about this woman, where she endures a series of increasingly elaborate pratfalls every time she is rude to people who don\u2019t deserve it. Honestly, I don\u2019t care who plays this. Steve-O in a wig could do it.

He was 91.\nThe Los Angeles county coroner\u2019s office confirmed Bean\u2019s Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a \u201ctraffic-related\u201d fatality. The coroner\u2019s office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from local news outlets.\nA man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles police department Brian Wendling initially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn\u2019t identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.\nBean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman.\nHe appeared in a number of films \u2013 notably, Anatomy of a Murder and Being John Malkovich \u2013 and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping. But fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onwards.\n\u201cMr Bean\u2019s face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar,\u201d the New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed \u201ca quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat\u201d.\nBorn in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean \u201cbecause it sounded funny\u201d.\nHis father, George, was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Bean recalled later that his \u201chouse was filled with causes\u201d. But he left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.\nBean\u2019s quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth. The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: \u201cWill the real (notable\u2019s name) please stand up?\u201d\nBean\u2019s style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on The Tonight Show more than 200 times.\nBut his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the cold war.\n\u201cBasically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend,\u201c he said in a 2001 interview. \u201cI stopped working on TV for a year\u201d\nThe blacklist didn\u2019t stop him in the theater. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod\u2019s 1955 Hollywood spoof Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O\u2019Sullivan in Never Too Late and with Melina Mercouri in Illya Darling, based on her hit film Never on Sunday.\nBean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the US and \u2013 after a period as a self-described \u201chouse-husband\u201d \u2013 resumed his career.\nIn the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman. He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as Desperate Housewives, How I Met Your Mother and Modern Family.\nMeanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. He became related to a leading rightwing commentator, Andrew Breitbart, when his daughter, Susannah, married him. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart\u2019s eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.\nHe had a daughter, Michele, from his first marriage to Jacqueline de Sibour, and sons Max and Ezekiel and daughter Susannah from his marriage to Carolyn Maxwell.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/paw-performance-cats-cast-dominate-razzie-award-nominations": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/08/paw-performance-cats-cast-dominate-razzie-award-nominations", "title": "Paw performance: Cats dominates Razzie nominations", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 11:07:24 GMT", "summary": "<p>British actors including Judi Dench and James Corden among worst actor nominees </p><p>The widely panned movie musical Cats and four of its stars have been nominated for Razzie awards, an annual ritual that lampoons the worst of cinema.</p><p>James Corden, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson and Francesca Hayward received Razzie acting nominations for their Cats roles, in which they wore digitally created fur.

Some of the phrases he uses sound modern, not Victorian. \u201cI have been writing my head off since ten o\u2019clock,\u201d he writes in one.\nAnother letter shines a light on the grief he felt at the sudden death of his 17-year-old sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, on whom he based Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop. The letter to his illustrator gives instructions for Nell\u2019s death scene.\n\u201cI want it to express the most beautiful repose and tranquility and wear something of a happy look, if death can,\u201d he writes. \u201cI am breaking my heart over this story and cannot bear to finish it.\u201d\nThe hoard also includes a delicate unfinished drawing of Dickens in chalk and pastels by \n. This original was assumed to have been lost.\nSughrue said the anonymous collector had been a devoted Dickens fan since he read Oliver Twist as a child. He amassed a huge collection \u201cwith a real connoisseur\u2019s eye; he knew what he was looking for\u201d.\nThe museum\u2019s chair, Mark Dickens \u2013 great-great-grandson of Charles \u2013 said the purchase was highly significant. \u201cThe museum already holds an impressive collection of Dickens-related material, and his quite staggering material brings us even closer to the man himself, his character, feelings, family and friends.\u201d\nThe new acquisitions will be researched, catalogued and conserved before going on display online and at the museum in Doughty Street in \n.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/07/phillip-schofield-itv-presenter-announces-he-is-gay": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/07/phillip-schofield-itv-presenter-announces-he-is-gay", "title": "Phillip Schofield, ITV presenter, announces he is gay", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:11:22 GMT", "summary": "<p>ITV show host appeals for kindness, particularly to wife and daughters who support him<br></p><p>Phillip Schofield, the co-presenter of ITV\u2019s This Morning, has announced he is gay.</p><p>In a statement released on the programme\u2019s Twitter account, the presenter, who has been married to his wife for almost 27 years, paid tribute to his family.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/07/phillip-schofield-itv-presenter-announces-he-is-gay\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Phillip Schofield, the co-presenter of ITV\u2019s This Morning, has announced he is gay.\nIn a statement released on the programme\u2019s Twitter account, the presenter, who has been married to his wife for almost 27 years, paid tribute to his family.\n\u201cWith the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact I am gay,\u201d he said.\nThe 57-year-old also said he had cried on the shoulder of his co-presenter, \n.

When we play outside \n we get such a good reaction now.

Singer explains the meaning and genesis of their song, Lipstick Coch \u2013 red lipstick. It was written by the bassist Gwenllian Anthony and tells the story of a male date turning up wearing bright red lipstick.\nAdwaith is also one of the bands releasing a special record to mark the day. Theirs is a take on the folk song Ar Lan y M\u00f4r (Beside The Sea) revved up with a surf-rock riff. \u201cIt started off as a joke to be honest,\u201d said Singer. \u201cThen we were like hang on, this will work perfectly in our set.\nThe band are working on a song about Welsh independence for their next album. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re political,\u201d she said. \u201cWe write about things that matter to us and annoy us.\u201d\nIt is not that Welsh pop or rock music is new.
