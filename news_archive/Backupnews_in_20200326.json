The chancellor said he can no longer justify, after things get back to normal, that self-employed people pay less tax than the employed.

the social distancing - that have been put into place\", but things appeared to be \"starting to move in the right direction\".\nThe government has imposed strict controls on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the disease.  \nIn other developments:\njumped by more than 100 in a day for the first time.\nearlier package of economic measures.\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52050577": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52050577", "title": "Coronavirus: Jeremy Corbyn says government has been 'too slow'", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:58:54 GMT", "summary": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the most vulnerable have been given the least help.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/208x117/p087sx0f.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52052694": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52052694", "title": "Coronavirus: 'Mix-up' over EU ventilator scheme", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:11:17 GMT", "summary": "Labour demands an \"urgent explanation\" from ministers over why they did not join EU equipment plan.", "story": "The government says a communications mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators for the coronavirus crisis. \nMinisters were earlier accused of putting Brexit before public health when Downing Street said the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme.\nBut No 10 now says officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and it could join future schemes.\nLabour is demanding to know why the government had changed its message.\nThe party's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"Given the huge need for PPE, testing capacity and crucial medical equipment including ventilators, people will want to know why on Monday ministers were saying they had 'chosen other routes' over the joint EU procurement initiatives but now they are claiming that they missed the relevant emails. \n\"We need an urgent explanation from ministers about how they will get crucial supplies to the frontline as a matter of urgency.\"\nHe has said the UK \"should be co-operating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit\".\nThe EU has said the UK can take part in the procurement project, which will use the EU's buying power to purchase more stock, even though it is no longer a member of the bloc.  \nBut earlier on Thursday, Downing Street said the UK would not be joining the scheme because \"we are no longer members of the EU\".\nThe spokesman added: \u201cWe are conducting our own work on ventilators and we\u2019ve had a very strong response from business, and we\u2019ve also procured ventilators from the private sector in the UK and from international manufacturers.\"\nMr Johnson's spokesman denied the decision was motivated by Brexit, adding: \"This is an area where we\u2019re making our own efforts.\u201d\nThe government faced a backlash from opposition MPs following the statement, with Liberal Democrat Layla Moran accusing the prime minister of putting \"Brexit over breathing\". \nDowning Street has now issued a statement saying the UK had missed the deadline for the first round of procurements.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"As the (European) Commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year.\n\"As those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.\"\nThe UK currently has 8,000 ventilators available and has placed orders for another 8,000 from existing manufacturers, but there are concerns about capacity in hospitals as the spread of the virus worsens.\nLast week, the government put out a call for other British businesses to convert their factories to make the equipment, and has since signed a contract for 10,000 ventilators with Dyson.\nBut Boris Johnson's spokesman confirmed the ventilators still needed to go through standards checks and would not be bought and distributed until that happened. \nThe EU scheme will use the bloc's joint procurement agreement, which helps member states get the medical supplies it needs to tackle cross-border pandemics. \nIt has also created a stockpile of medical equipment -

The law also allows the government to extend the three month notice period to six months if it chooses.The government's own explanatory notes on the bill say it \"does not prevent a landlord from serving a notice of intention\" to evict a tenant, \"nor does it end a tenant's liability for rental payments\". \nIn Tuesday's House of Commons debate, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the party was \"extremely disappointed\" with the measures which he described as \"just not good enough\".\nEarlier, Mr Healey tweeted: \"This is not an evictions ban, as Labour argued for, and renters were eventually promised by Boris Johnson. \n\"This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing said claims it was \"rowing back\" on its promises to renters were \"absolute nonsense\". \n\"As soon as legislation is passed, no new possession proceedings will begin - in either the social sector or the private rented sector - for at least the next 3 months.

They can do so using powers included in legislation passed in 1984.\nOnce the bill passes, officials will have the power to close the borders in the event that the Border Force is under intense pressure due to staffing shortages.\nIt also puts into law powers to isolate or detain individuals who are judged to be a risk to containing the spread of Covid-19.\nSince the outbreak of coronavirus, there has been pressure on the government to support workers who are unable to work during the crisis.\nTo support businesses, the bill will allow employers to reclaim statutory sick pay funds from HMRC to help with the burden of increased staff absence. For workers, it will scrap the three-day waiting period so that they can receive the payments from the day they stop working.\nFollowing pressure from Tory MPs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the bill would be debated and voted on every six months to ensure Parliament was \"content with its continuation\".\nAcknowledging the \"difficult\" powers being sought by ministers were \"unprecedented in peacetime\", he insisted they would be \"relinquished\" as soon as the threat to the UK had passed.\nA succession of Conservative MPs welcomed the move but sought assurances that the measures would only apply to fighting the virus.\nTom Tugendhat expressed concern that the powers could - in different circumstances - be used in a \"malicious fashion\".\nDavid Davis sought reassurances that individual elements of the bill could be removed if they were not working as intended, while Steve Baker called for a sunset clause - when the bill would automatically expire - of one rather than two years. \nOther MPs are angry about the measures introduced to protect renters from eviction after the prime minister promised to address fears. \nLabour's shadow Housing Secretary John Healey criticised a government amendment passed on Monday that extended the eviction warning period to three months, tweeting: \"This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.\"\nLabour's shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said no MPs \"came into this House\" to give powers of this kind to the executive, \"curtailing some of the basic freedoms our forebears fought for and we take for granted\".\nWhile Labour believed unprecedented measures were now needed to \"save lives and protect our communities\", he said the measures would \"chill every Liberal in the House\" and it only offered its support with a \"heavy heart\".\nHowever, he said the bill required careful scrutiny to ensure the \"quite extraordinary\" powers were not abused, particularly in changes to rules on mental health sectioning and the provision of social care.  \nThe bill, he warned, would give councils the power to \"downgrade\" care for the disabled and the elderly and that this should be subject to a review by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.\nWhile councils should be able to prioritise those with the greatest needs in the event of staff shortages, \"what no-one of us wants to see is the legal minimum of support become the default\".\nAny legislation has to pass to the House of Lords once it has cleared the Commons. The government has no majority on the red benches, so peers could cause some problems if they want to make changes to the bill.\nIt is more likely that ministers will introduce their own amendments to correct or clarify some of the measures.\nIf they do, this would probably happen on Wednesday, at report stage. It could return to MPs immediately if they in session.\nEither way, it should be signed into law by the end of Thursday, giving ministers powers that would be unprecedented in normal times.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E5DB/production/_111334885_whatsubject.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52036355": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52036355", "title": "Ministers warned coronavirus bill threatens services for disabled people", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 14:56:28 GMT", "summary": "Campaigners warn changes to care provision will be life-changing for people with disabilities", "story": "The rights of people with disabilities must be protected as the UK responds to the coronavirus pandemic, campaigners have urged.\nDisability rights groups have warned that safeguards could be sacrificed as part of new emergency powers.\nThey are particularly concerned what will happen when carers either fall ill or need to go into-self-isolation.\nBaroness Grey-Thompson said she was worried that disabled people \"might be seen as expendable\".\nMPs approved sweeping new powers for the government to deal with the outbreak on Tuesday.

the NHS.\nThe order is still subject to the devices passing stringent medical tests but that is expected to happen quickly.\nDyson has had hundreds of engineers working round the clock to design the ventilators from scratch.\nIt hopes to build the ventilators at scale from its UK base in Wiltshire - using aircraft hangars that were used to stuff parachutes in the World War Two.\nHowever, the blitz spirit the company is keen to channel will not produce immediate results. \nIt is thought that even if regulatory approval is forthcoming, it could take a couple of weeks to move from prototype to the device being made in significant scale.\nIn the meantime, the government has told the BBC that is \"picking the low-hanging fruit\" by buying as many existing models as it can.\nCurrently, the NHS has just over 8,000 ventilators, the government thinks it can procure a further 8,000 from existing domestic and international suppliers.\nIt estimates that the NHS will need at least 30,000 to deal with the potential flood of virus victims.\nHowever, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told the BBC's Today programme: \"We need to remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\"When it comes to miles eight to 10, those ventilators that are currently being procured and ordered from around the world will be very helpful, although the lack of ventilation available right now is a real issue.\"\nBy way of comparison, the state of New York has targeted the same number of 30,000 required ventilators, even though it has a population one third the size of the UK's.\nThe race has been on for weeks to produce tens of thousands of ventilators to keep people with Coronavirus-related breathing difficulties alive.\nIn one corner is vacuum and hairdryer maker,

Compensation Scheme Bill is expected to pass through its final Commons stages on Tuesday.\nMembers of the Windrush generation and their families who were wrongly told they were in Britain illegally have been promised financial redress.\nA recent review found a \u201cprofound institutional failure\u201d had turned thousands of lives upside down.\nAn estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been called the Windrush generation, a reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948.\nThey were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents.\nChanges to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK.\nSome were held in detention or deported, despite living in the country legally for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment.\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has apologised for this \u201cbetrayal of trust\u201d and said all those entitled to compensation will receive it.\nThe first payments from the scheme have been made, although legislation is necessary to authorise public expenditure relating to it. \nThe bill has cross-party support although Labour has been pushing for wider eligibility criteria, faster payments, and more assistance for those seeking justice.\nThe legislation will also need to be approved by the House of Lords before it becomes law.\nIt is unclear whether this will happen before Parliament breaks up for its Easter recess on Tuesday, amid speculation that this could be brought forward due to the coronavirus pandemic. \nCompensation payments will be calculated through an assessment of the financial impact on individuals\u2019 lives, such as loss of income and access to housing, of not being able to prove their immigration status.\nThe Home Office has said it will

fallout?", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:13:28 GMT", "summary": "What could the acquittal of the former first minister mean for the Scottish government, the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon?", "story": "Alex Salmond has walked free from the High Court after being acquitted of charges of sexual assault - but he has made clear that this is far from the end of the matter. With a series of inquiries in the pipeline, what is going to come next?\nIn the first instance, very little is going to happen. Politics is essentially on hold while the country is in the grip of the coronavirus crisis - there are frankly far more important things to be dealing with right now.\nBut there is already much activity beneath the surface, with both opposition politicians and some within the SNP starting to pose questions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will answer many of them in due course.\nWhat did we learn during the trial which could give an indication of the political fallout from the case?\nTo start at the end of the trial, what did Mr Salmond mean when he said outside court that there was \"certain evidence I would have liked to have seen led in this trial\" which had not come out?\nThis almost certainly refers to the limits placed on the questions which can be asked of complainers in sexual offences trials. Primarily this refers to questioning about their sexual history, but it can also extend to other matters.\nThere was much debate in pre-trial hearings - which could not be reported until after the trial itself - about what could be asked of the complainers.\nThe defence wanted to press some of the women about later developments, around the judicial review process where Mr Salmond challenged the government over its handling of internal complaints against him.\nLady Dorrian ruled that this would remove the focus of the trial to another matter - which took place a decade after some of the charges - and would distract the jury from the merits of the charges themselves.\nThe defence actually tried to challenge this decision with another judge, but were rebuffed by Lady Stacey in similar terms.\nWhy did the defence want to talk about the judicial review? Because they believed it was central to a politically-driven conspiracy against Mr Salmond.\nThere was little direct talk of this in the trial itself, Gordon Jackson's assertions that \"this stinks\" in his closing speech aside. Mr Salmond said some allegations had been \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\", but the jury were never told ministerial code this might have been the case.\nTo again look to the pre-trial hearings, here the defence were able to be much clearer. Mr Jackson said there had been \"a great deal of egg on faces\" in government over the \"spectacular\" collapse of its case in the judicial review.\nHe said that after this, people working within the current administration turned their attention \"very directly\" to the criminal probe and \"sought to influence that process to discredit the former first minister\".\nText messages were read out saying Mr Salmond's ire over the botched internal probe risked \"bringing down Nicola on the way\".\nWhere might this evidence come out, then, if not in court?\nMSP Alex Neil has called for a \"judge led public inquiry\" - post-coronavirus - to find out if there was a \"criminal\" conspiracy to \"do in Alex Salmond\".\nHowever, a series of inquiries are already waiting in the wings, having been set up in 2019 before being put on ice after criminal charges were brought.\nA parliamentary inquiry is due to examine the role of Nicola Sturgeon and her advisors in the internal inquiry, which the government conceded had been unlawful shortly before Mr Salmond's legal challenge was to be heard at the Court of Session.\nMs Sturgeon insisted at the time that the process was \"completely robust\" and had only fallen down in one \"deeply regrettable\" area in the case of Mr Salmond.\nHowever, one of the complainers in the trial also hit out at the government process, saying it was \"flawed\" and that she didn't want to be part of the internal inquiry because there was too much \"risk\" around it.\nThis is almost certainly set to be the focus of much of the parliamentary inquiry - along with the questions posed repeatedly at Holyrood back in 2019, about what Ms Sturgeon knew and when.\nThe first minister has also referred herself to a standards panel who will decide whether she broke the deeply inappropriate during the government investigation of her predecessor.\nMs Sturgeon told MSPs she had face-to-face meetings with Mr Salmond and spoke to him on the phone while the probe was ongoing, but insisted that she \"acted appropriately and in good faith\" at all times.\nMs Sturgeon previously insisted that she first heard about complaints against Mr Salmond at a meeting at her house in Glasgow on 2 April, 2018. She has also said this meeting was party business, rather than that of the government - negating the need for official notes to be taken.\nThis meeting was facilitated by Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein. And while giving evidence under oath, Mr Aberdein said he had held an earlier meeting with Ms Sturgeon at her Holyrood office, on 29 March.\nThe question eliciting this revelation appeared to be specifically prompted by Mr Salmond, who called his QC across for consultation before it was asked. Clearly, the former first minister thinks this a significant point.\nWhat actually happened at that meeting was not discussed in court, but the fact it was held sparks immediate questions. If it was in the first minister's parliamentary office, was it government business? And why did we only hear about it via testimony in court? \nAnd outside of government itself, there have also been questions asked about the role of the SNP.\nMr Salmond's supporters were quick to comment on the verdict, with Kenny MacAskill calling for resignations - without specifying whose - and Joanna Cherry demanding an independent inquiry into the party's internal complaints procedure.\nOne complainer, Woman H, said she had made a complaint to the SNP specifically so it would be on file for vetting purposes should Mr Salmond ever run for office again.\nThe court heard she had received a text message from a party official saying \"we'll sit on that and hope we never need to deploy it\".\nWoman H was clear that this was at her request, but questions are sure to be asked about a process which saw a complaint of sexual assault effectively buried. What else might political parties be \"sitting on\"?\nMr Salmond quit the party at the point he launched his judicial review. Will he now seek to rejoin it? Or has the rift with the current leadership grown too stark?\nFinally, while he has walked free from court acquitted on all counts, has Mr Salmond's reputation come through the trial intact?\nHe will not mind that one verdict was \"not proven\" rather than not guilty - in practice, they mean the same thing, that he is innocent in the eyes of the law.\nHe is free to return to normal life and society - albeit a society currently in lockdown - and will presumably keep his arm in the political debate while presenting his TV show on Russian channel RT.\nBut the defence case readily admitted that he had not always behaved well. Mr Jackson said throughout that the \"touchy-feely\" Mr Salmond could certainly act inappropriately, and led witnesses who called him \"extraordinarily pugnacious\" and \"extremely demanding\". \nThe QC said in his closing speech that the former first minister \"could certainly have been a better man\" - but that none of this made him a criminal, something the jury accepted.\nMr Salmond admitted to having a \"sleepy cuddle\" with one complainer, and what Mr Jackson called \"a bit of how's your father\" with another - both members of his staff far younger than he, and neither of them his wife.\nThe defence also never really attempted to dispel the slightly raucous image of Bute House drawn by the prosecution, of exotic liquors being poured late at night after celebrity dinners and staff being invited to do paperwork in the bedroom.\nTo stress again, a jury has ruled that none of this was criminal conduct. But that does not mean nobody will question it. The SNP's equalities convener has already called elements of it \"\n\", although Mr Salmond is also sure to fight for his reputation in light of the verdict.\nWhile the trial may be over, the political fallout is only just beginning. This is a difficult moment for all concerned - ultimately, very few people may come out of this affair well.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12DE/production/_111403840_pa-52505599.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52005581": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52005581", "title": "Coronavirus: \u2018How is \u00a394 a week going to pay anyone\u2019s bills?\u2019", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:42:57 GMT", "summary": "Freelance gig economy workers say they cannot survive on the support offered by the government.", "story": "Freelance workers feel they have been forgotten, after hearing about the latest financial measures announced by the UK government on Friday to bolster the economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak \n, but did not guarantee their wages. \n\"I was absolutely devastated,\" said Chloe Hall, a freelance marketing consultant based in Newcastle upon Tyne. \"We work just as hard, but freelancers are always sort of at the bottom of the pile.\"\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, there are five million self-employed people in the UK, who make up 15% of the labour market.\nMs Hall told the BBC she had cancelled subscription services and even her business bank account in a bid to reduce costs, but without work, she didn't know how she would pay her bills.\n\"Without the mortgage, my essential bills come to \u00a3948 a month,\" she said. \"\u00a394.25 a week [the Universal Credit payment] - how is that going to pay anybody's bills?\"\nThe measures announced by the Chancellor to help small businesses and the self-employed included:\nThe Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents gig economy workers, has announced that it is suing the government over its failure to protect the wages and jobs of millions of workers during the pandemic, as well as its failure to ensure the health and safety of those still employed through proper sick pay.\nIWGB General Secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee said: \"No one wants to be litigating right now.

However, fines won't be issued until Parliament passes the emergency legislation - which should be by the end of Thursday.\nDowning Street says fines could initially be set at \u00a330, but that could increase significantly if people don't comply. \nCouncils will also play a role to make sure local businesses follow the rules. \nThe Local Government Association says that \"anyone who sees a business breaching government closure restrictions should report it to their local council so it can investigate and take appropriate action\".\nSome other types of non-food retailers are also allowed to stay open, according to government guidance:\nIf a customer visits any of these premises, they need to ensure they stick to the social distancing rules.\nCustomers should still be able to receive online deliveries.\nAmazon said there would be some changes, with essential items (like food and healthcare products) being prioritised. That means that delivery times for other items may take longer than usual.\nIn order to avoid any unnecessary contact, Amazon in-home deliveries have been paused and drivers have been advised to place packages at the customer's doorstep and step back.

Some are likely to be anxious, so how can parents help them cope?\nNo school for the \"foreseeable\" future. Exams off. Clubs closed.\nMillions of children will be looking forward to a spring, and possibly a summer, free of responsibility and routine. But these are not normal times - they're likely to have to spend days and nights indoors with parents or guardians.\nThey won't get much personal contact with friends and, for teenagers, the cancellation of exams will make a difficult time of year even more worrying.\n\"It's the perfect storm for parents and children,\" says Sam Cartwright-Hatton, professor of clinical child psychology at the University of Sussex.\n\"It's not just the fact that they're going to be cooped up together. Emotions are also going to be super-stressed because - on top of what young people are feeling - parents are worried about jobs, food supplies, paying the next mortgage bill.\"\nAs households begin this forced experiment in enclosed living, Prof Cartwright-Hatton advocates setting a clear routine, particularly for younger children - such as a couple of hours of school work in the morning or a specified time for craft work in the afternoon.\nShe argues that pre-teenage children \"turn inwards quite quickly\" if they spend too much time alone.\nParents should play with them and encourage those of an adventurous nature to regard the situation as an \"adventure\". This approach won't work for the more sensitive children who will need extra reassurance.\nProf Cartwright-Hatton recommends keeping classmates and members of clubs like Brownies, football teams and music groups in touch via Skype, FaceTime, Zoom or other video-conferencing services. This would allow them to share details of their day and play games.\n\"I would worry about a child who had no-one to play with for six months. We're going to have to get creative in keeping children connected to their peer groups. Kerplunk won't work on Skype, but Cluedo or Monopoly might.\"\nGoing out won't be as easy as it usually is, which could add to a feeling of claustrophobia as spring and summer approach. Those with gardens are encouraged to use them for fresh air and exercise.\n\"A balance has to be struck between mental and physical health, depending on what the next piece of official information is,\" says Eva Lloyd OBE, professor of early childhood at the University of East London. \n\"If it's safe to go the park, people should do that too.\"\nIt's impossible to shield all but the youngest children from coronavirus talk, particularly with parents turning on TVs at 17:00 GMT for the latest government briefing.\nBut Prof Cartwright-Hatton suggests not exposing under-10s to any news at all, except in tailored forms such as the BBC's Newsround, which consults experts on its likely psychological impact.\nTeenagers are better equipped to make their own judgements, but they should not be left in their rooms for hours on end searching the internet or using social media unsupervised, she warns.  \nAnother potential outcome of so much information coming children's way - along with a great deal of advice, such as standing two metres away from grandparents to avoid possible transmission - is \"guilt\", says Prof Lloyd.\n\"I worry that they'll wonder whether this is happening because of something they've done,\" she adds. \"It's a very strange situation for them. We've got to show them that none of this is their fault and that children throughout the world are going through the same experience.\"\nCoronavirus news is grim for people of all ages, but parents can offer perspective.\n\"Downplay their fears but be realistic,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hilton. \"Don't promise things that you can't be sure aren't true. If there's misinformation about the number of deaths from coronavirus, you can counter that.\n\"But, whenever you've discussed coronavirus, move on afterwards, so children don't spend too much time thinking about it.\"\nStudents who were due to take their GCSEs, A-levels, Highers and other exams have had them cancelled. They don't know when or if they will go ahead at a future date.\nTeenagers who would otherwise be revising could now be at home wondering how they will get their qualifications.\n\"I'd listen and be very sympathetic,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. \"Whatever emotions the situation is throwing up, tell them you understand how awful it must be at the moment and what a shame it is.\n\"But let them know you can't solve this for them. If they are really catastrophising about it - worrying that they won't go to university and won't get a job - correct that, because it's not the case.\"\nThe situation the UK finds itself in is new for parents and children.\nProf Lloyd says families should hold a \"review\" at the end of every week to discuss how the arrangement is faring.\n\"It's going to be challenging,\" she says. \"If it's not working, people will need to change it. We should include the children in discussions. From the age of about two they will want to have an input.\"\nDiscussions between parents over their own coronavirus worries can wait until after children have gone to bed, Prof Lloyd adds.\nAt the best of times, children are inclined to ask: \"Are we nearly there yet?\" or \"Is it nearly over?\" Explaining the word \"indefinite\" might prove problematic.\n\"For young children that's an emerging concept,\" says Prof Lloyd. \"You get them to imagine the summer holidays, that it would be long like them, but not so much fun.\"\nIt's a daunting prospect for parents, taking over what the state has offered for well over a century - daytime education and childcare. But might there be another way of looking at things to ensure the coming weeks and months are more bearable?\n\"We often talk about work-life balance and parents not being able to spend enough time with kids,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. \"That's not going to be a problem for a lot of people for quite a while now. We've got to look for the silver lining in all this.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/AB3C/production/_111363834_mum_daughter_yoga_get.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51628524": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51628524", "title": "Coronavirus: Wages, sick pay and time off explained", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:49:30 GMT", "summary": "What is happening to workers' wages and sick pay during the coronavirus outbreak?", "story": "Most of the wages of employees who are not working and otherwise would have lost their jobs during the coronavirus outbreak are being covered by the government.\nCompanies can receive grants to pay their workers 80% of their salaries - up to a limit of \u00a32,500 a month.\nEmployers have been urged not to cut jobs. Benefits payments are also to be increased. \nA similar package is now in place for the self-employed.\nThe intervention comes after people were told to work from home if they could.\nWith schools shutting, parents are having to work more flexibly, and self-isolation puts more pressure on businesses who have staff coming in.\nSick pay rules have been amended, and the self-employed will see their tax liabilities delayed.\nIf you are still employed but do not currently have work, the plan is that you will still get your wages.\nYour employer will be able to access grants, by the end of April, from the UK's tax authority to allow them to keep paying you.The typical worker is paid \u00a3585 a week, on a median average (which is the middle point of all workers), according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is about \u00a32,340 a month.\nThe government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nThese will be backdated to March and the scheme will last three months at least. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment.\nNo, this is for those who are on the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. \nSelf-employed people will receive support from another system.\nThose on working-age benefits will see a more generous Universal Credit system, rising by about \u00a320 a week for the next year. The same rise will be given to those still on the working tax credit system. The government says this will benefit more than four million of the lowest-income households.\nPublic sector workers are not covered because most of them have their wages paid directly by the government.\nEveryone who can work from home should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined, and staff should receive their normal pay.\nHowever, this puts various new responsibilities on an employer - for example, they are responsible for equipment they supply, and must say what it should be used for.\nThe question of who covers the running costs should ideally be outlined as soon as possible, as should how any extra expenses should be covered.\nAn employer has a duty of care for staff, even if they are working at home. \nThe requirements of the health and safety legislation apply to homeworkers too, according to the employment conciliation service Acas, which has set out guidance for employers and employees.\nWhen your children's school is closed, or if you have a relative who is ill, your employer must give you time off to look after them.\nBut your employer is not forced to pay you unless your contract requires it.\nHowever, many employers are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.\nKey workers, who have been defined by the government, can still send children to school or nursery.\nYou may do through sick pay which varies from company to company.\nMany employees will have contracts that allow them their normal pay while they are unable to work because they are sick.\nEven where people do not get their fully paid sick leave, or if they work in jobs where they do not have contractual sick leave, there may be minimum payments they can rely on, known as statutory sick pay.Statutory sick pay (SSP) is money paid by employers, so self-employed workers are not eligible, but casual or agency workers are. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that SSP would be paid to people who need to be off as they or their family have symptoms. People should be able to obtain a sick note from the NHS 111 service rather than getting one from a GP.\nThe rules were also changed so that those people would be eligible for SSP on their first day away from work, instead of having to wait until the fourth day as used to be the case.\nHe also announced that businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be able to claim back from the government two weeks of SSP paid to staff affected by coronavirus. \nIt is set at \u00a394.25 a week, although of course employers could pay more if they want to.\nTo get SSP people need to be earning at least \u00a3118 a week. Many people such as those on zero-hours contracts - who work variable hours every week - may earn less than this. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has calculated that there are two million workers who are not eligible for SSP.\nWe asked the Office for National Statistics to check this figure and they estimated that there were 1,766,000 jobs done by adults in the UK that paid less than \u00a3118 a week. \nThe number of people involved is likely to be somewhat lower than this because one person could have more than one of these jobs. And indeed, if somebody has more than one of these jobs it could take them above the \u00a3118 a week needed to qualify. \nAbout 70% of these jobs are done by women.\nFor self-employed people who have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant will be paid worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years - up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month.\nInitially, this will be available for three months in one lump-sum payment, and will start to be paid from June.\nIt will be called the Coronavirus Self-employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, are still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year.\nHowever, not all the self-employed are eligible.\nMeanwhile, the government has said it will make it \"quicker and easier\" for self-employed people seeing a sudden drop in income to access benefits.\nThe chancellor said that those on contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) will be able to claim from day one, instead of day eight.\nHe has removed the minimum income floor. The minimum income floor would have taken into account how much they would normally expect to earn in a month when calculating their entitlement to universal credit. \nNot having the floor means they will be able to claim for time they spend off work due to sickness.\nIt means self-employed people not covered by the specific scheme can now access, in full, universal credit at a rate equivalent to SSP for employees.\nMr Sunak said they would not need to attend a job centre and could apply on the phone or online instead.\nThe government has also announced a new \u00a3500m fund to support economically vulnerable people, which will be allocated by local authorities.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1787/production/_111032060_homeworking_getty.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51632801": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51632801", "title": "Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 12:53:15 GMT", "summary": "The UK's plan to tackle coronavirus has been changing.

Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.\nBut people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.\nCurrently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. \nSpecialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.\nThere are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds.\nBut NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used.\nMinisters are also working with private companies to ramp up production.\nA third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests.\nDoctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form, you will need to visit the mobile version of the \"we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks\". to submit your question or send it via email to terms & conditions.

And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,\" he added.\nThe speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.\nDigger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.\nChairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do \"whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing\".\nFollowing reports in today\u2019s media, JCB Chairman Lord Bamford said: \n\u201cWe have been approached by the Prime Minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment.\u201d \nEnd of Twitter post  by @JCBmachines\nThe cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or \"elective\" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.\nHe said the sorts of operations that could be delayed \"in this emergency\" situation included hip and knee operations.\nOperating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they \"can be turned into wards\" for coronavirus patients.\nThis measure is \"one of the first things that we're going to do\", he added.\nAll those extra ventilators will throw up another problem - there are not enough trained nurses and doctors to operate them.\nTo fix this, Mr Hancock said the government wanted to bring recently-retired doctors \"back into service\".\nBut, the health secretary said, some of those workers would need to be trained up to deal with the specific needs of Covid-19 - which is a respiratory disease, \n\"We will be stopping some other activity, and asking doctors who normally do other things to retrain to be able to, for instance, use the ventilators.\" \nHe would not say how long it might take to train people up but did say: \"We will do it as fast as we can.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D210/production/_111267735_gettyimages-466409045.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-51776404": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-51776404", "title": "Election 2019: What's the evidence that Russia interfered?", "published": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:17:54 GMT", "summary": "A trove of confidential UK government documents was leaked online in the run-up to the last general election \u2013 but who\u2019s to blame? We look at the evidence.", "story": "A leak of confidential UK government documents in the run-up to last December's general election has been blamed on Russian actors. But what evidence is there to say the Russian government itself tried to interfere in British politics?\nWith just about two weeks to go before election day, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a trove of confidential documents outlining talks between UK and US officials about a possible future trade deal. \nThe leak fuelled a debate about the future of the NHS and made the headlines for days, particularly after evidence emerged blaming Russians for the leak.\nBut a key question remains unanswered, three months after the vote: Was the Russian government directly involved?\nThe 451-page trove of documents first emerged online in October. \nA user going by the name \"Gregoratior\" posted a link to the documents on discussion website Reddit, suggesting the publication would \"make some noise\". \nIt didn't at first: only a small number of Reddit users noticed the post and commented on it. \nOn Twitter, politicians and journalists also failed to immediately notice the leak, despite repeated attempts by a Twitter account, again with the handle \"Gregoratior\", to get their attention. Since then, the account has been suspended. \nThe programme that takes an investigative look at social media, from the BBC World Service.\nWith less than a week to go before the election, Listen to our investigation 'Did Russia leak British secrets online?' linking the \"Gregoratior\" account to a known disinformation campaign coming out of Russia. \nThe website banned the account, along with 60 other related accounts suspected of misusing the platform and engaging in what they called \"influence operations\". \nWe asked Reddit if we could examine the evidence the company holds linking these accounts to Russian operators - but they declined to show us.\nIt also remains unclear how the Labour Party got hold of the leaked documents. At the time, they did not reveal their source, and they did not respond to BBC Trending's recent requests for comment.\nAt the time of the leak, Mr Corbyn described suggestions that Labour might have benefited from a Russian operation as \"\n\". \nBut there is stronger evidence pointing to the involvement of Russian hackers - albeit not conclusive proof that the Kremlin itself is involved.\nLast year, Facebook shut down Reddit released a statement for engaging in what the company described as \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour\".\nThey were linked to what the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank, would later identify as \"\n\" - a disinformation campaign stemming from Russia.\nThrough a network of bogus social media accounts, this campaign tried to spread forged documents and false news stories that, according to DFRLab, \"attacked Western interests and unity\".\nOften translated into several languages, many of these stories were published on websites open to contributions from the public.\nWhen the leak of UK-US trade documents hit the headlines, open-source investigators noticed how the files were published and distributed online. Soon, the similarities with \"Operation Secondary Infektion\" became evident. \n\"The tradecraft was absolutely identical,\" says Ben Nimmo, who worked on the original DFRLab report and is currently head of investigations at US company Graphika. \nNimmo outlined the similarities between the earlier operation and the UK leaks in nonsense released in December. \n\"The same type of pages were being used, similar username strategies were being used,\" says Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. \"It either is an actor who is replicating these efforts or it is the same actor.\" \nThere was however one key difference: while \"Operation Secondary Infektion\" spread false stories based on forged documents - often clear and preposterous fakes - the \"Gregoratior\" leak of trade talk documents seems authentic.\nThe Cabinet Office declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, but no government official has yet denounced them as forgeries.\n\"The big question is still: How did internal UK government documents end up on Reddit in the first place?\" says Mr Nimmo. \nDue to the possibility that hackers may have been involved in gaining access to the documents, the National Cyber Security Centre is currently investigating.\nWhile the evidence points back to Russian territory, it is far more difficult to determine who specifically was carrying out the operation and, more importantly, on whose orders.\n\"It was sophisticated, it was well resourced,\" says Mr Nimmo. \"The likeliest candidate is either some form of Russian state operator or some proxy of the Russian state operators.\" But he and several other experts stop short of drawing a definitive line to the Russian government.\n\"Yes, Russia does have that strategy in their playbook,\" Ms Neudert says. \"But it could also be private actors, some sort of hacker collective, it could be some sort of tech-savvy trolling... There are many kinds of actors that are hacking private information.\"\nThe Russian Embassy in London denied any links to either \"Operation Secondary Infektion\" or the leak of UK-US trade documents.\nOther experts warned that an exclusive focus on Russia could deflect attention from other campaigns.\n\"Russia has a habit of trying to interfere in western countries' elections,\" says Elisabeth Braw, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. \"They are extremely good at corrupting our public discourse.\"\n\"But we have a situation where it's very easy to blame Russia,\" Ms Braw says. \"That is extremely dangerous, because we neglect to examine the activities of other countries that want to weaken our societies, such as China, North Korea, or Iran.\"\nIn October, the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee completed a report outlining the various ways in which Russia has recently tried to interfere with British democracy. dozens of accounts, pages and groups run from Russia, prompting accusations that it might be Operation Secondary Infektion. Number 10 denies the accusation and says a normal timetable has been followed. \nPublication is now expected later this year, once a new Intelligence and Security Committee has been appointed.a report: \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/879C/production/_111161743_trending_russia_070320.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17442946": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17442946", "title": "Budget 2020: Richer or poorer?

From April, you start paying when earning \u00a39,500.\nThat will mean 500,000 people will no longer have to pay this tax, according to independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). \nThose still paying will save up to \u00a385 a year on average. The chancellor said it would be just over \u00a3100 a year, but that calculation may not include the self-employed.\nThe IFS says 8% of the gains go to the poorest 20% of working households, so it is those on a decent income who may benefit the most. However, those working in a number of low-paying part-time jobs could see their take-home pay increase significantly.\nAnother tax to be cut is VAT on digital books, newspapers and magazines.\nMany of the measures aimed to tackle the impact of coronavirus benefit small businesses and so protect some jobs. This has been coordinated with the interest rate cut announced by the Bank of England.\nSpecific personal finance changes include the chancellor saying all of those advised to self-isolate, even if they do not show symptoms, are to receive statutory sick pay if eligible. \nUK employees have already started to get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, to help contain coronavirus. This is paid by the employer, but smaller businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of paying sick pay for the 14 days of isolation.\nThose who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed, will be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from day one of \"illness\" rather than day eight.\nESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth \u00a373.10 a week, or \u00a357.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people.\nCouncils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area, with money distributed through council tax discounts.\nThe highly complicated way in which high earners are taxed is set to change. Basically, tax relief on pensions becomes less generous if annual income exceeds \u00a3150,000 a year. This has become a problem as the income cap includes the value of pensions earned, not just salary.\nSome doctors have been refusing to work extra hours (and earning more) because they were being landed with much bigger tax bills.\nThey, and other high earners, are currently affected by this restriction once income goes over \u00a3110,000. The government has promised this may only kick in once annual income exceeds \u00a3200,000.\nThe duties on alcoholic drinks - beer, wine and cider - are all being frozen. So that means no extra tax on a pint or glass.\nThere has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade, and this will continue for at least another year.\nAbout 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.\nDuty on cigarettes and cigars will go up by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation plus 2% until the end of this Parliament (usually five years). That is a 27p rise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. Hand-rolling tobacco duty will rise by RPI plus 6% in April. \nLeaseholders will be able to access grants to safely remove unsafe cladding from flats. Some have told the BBC about how they could not sell owing to the issue.\nThe 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the \"tampon tax\" - will be abolished from January. This was trailed by the Treasury at the weekend.\nPeople can put a lot more into tax-free savings for children. The allowance for Junior Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) and Child Trust Funds will be increased from \u00a34,368 to \u00a39,000 in April. However, the typical amount saved is only about \u00a31,000.\nOwners of new motorhomes, who were facing a massive rise in vehicle excise duty, will now only face a much lower charge, following a campaign by the industry.\nThose working from home, who can claim \u00a34 a week off their income tax bill, will be able to claim \u00a36 from April.\nThis April, the amount earned before paying 20% income tax will be frozen at \u00a312,500. Also frozen is the \u00a350,000 threshold at which people start to pay the higher 40% rate of income tax. \nPractically, that means anyone who gets a pay rise in the coming year may be at risk of paying more than they expected in tax, as the extra wages mean they cross these thresholds.\nIf you are living in Scotland, you have different income tax rates from the rest of the UK. Changes were announced in the recent Scottish budget. \nOther big changes to your finances in April had already been set, including:\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/689C/production/_111208762_budgetman_getty.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51707579": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51707579", "title": "Can Tories and trade unions be friends?", "published": "Fri, 06 Mar 2020 02:01:17 GMT", "summary": "One Conservative MP is urging the two sides to work together for their own good - and that of the UK.", "story": "The Conservative Party and trade unions have a history of troubled relations. But one Tory MP thinks they can work together for the good of each other - and the country.\n\"Trade unions are a very good thing,\" says Robert Halfon.\nThey're not words one would expect from a self-described \"tribal\" Conservative MP who, growing up, saw his party's leadership engage in a year-long battle - which sometimes turned violent - against the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).\nThe miners' strike of 1984-5 was the bitterest industrial dispute in recent UK history. The NUM's eventual defeat, and the subsequent closure of the UK's deep coalmines meant that, for many trade unionists, Tories became hate figures.\nMargaret Thatcher, prime minister at the time, branded striking miners' leaders \nSo how are relations between Tories and unions these days?\n\"The problem is there's always a Pavlov's dog reaction on both sides,\" says Mr Halfon. \"You mention Tories to trade unions and they say 'no way.' And, on the Tory side, mention unions and they just think of strikes and pickets. And trade unionism is much bigger than that.\"\nMr Halfon, honorary president of the Conservatives' Union Blue group, wants his party to change its pitch to potential members. Like some unions, it should offer perks such as private healthcare and travel discounts, legal representation, and better access to loans and insurance, he argues.\n\"It can't be gimmicks,\" Mr Halfon, MP for Harlow, in Essex, says. \"People aren't going to join for a Nando's card. This is revolutionary for the Conservative Party and it would be a very, very different model of membership.\n\"Nowadays you can join the party by the internet, which is great. But what do you get for joining? Absolutely nothing, apart from letters asking for money and voting in a leadership contest or for a candidate.\"\nBut there is one perk common to Conservative and Working Men's Clubs, he says. \n\"They're very good because you can actually get a pint of Guinness for a very decent price.\"\nAt December's general election, Boris Johnson's party made incursions into areas where Labour - and unions - once dominated political life. The County Durham seats of Bishop Auckland and Sedgefield, formerly held by Tony Blair, were among those that turned blue.\nSupport for Brexit and Mr Johnson's promise to \"get it done\" is cited as a major cause. After his election win, the prime minister acknowledged that many lifelong Labour voters had part of the \"enemy within\". and vowed to repay them.\n\"I think the elections made a huge difference to our party,\" Mr Halfon says. \n\"There are more Tory MPs who have been trade union members than before. The party should make it its main mission to support trade unionism as a model.\n\"People have got to think imaginatively. We live in an atomised society and I want institutions that bring people together.\"\nIn 1953, the Conservative Party \"lent\" the Conservatives their backing By last year the figure, had an estimated 2.8 million members., was 180,000.\nTrade unions, at their peak in the late 1970s, had around 12 million members. Since then several laws have come into force aimed at making industrial action harder to organise  - most notably those passed under Mrs Thatcher's Conservative government.\n\"Both we and the unions have seen a decline, but the Conservative Party would give our right hands to have millions of members,\" says Mr Halfon.\nOf the 48 unions comprising the Trades Union Congress (TUC), \nMr Halfon, himself a member of the non-party-aligned Prospect union, suggests the Tory leadership can work with \"moderate\" and \"sensible\" trade unionists, without allowing legalising now banned practices like closed shops and secondary picketing.\nHe has even suggested that a union could become affiliated to the Conservative Party, but there is little sign of this happening soon.\n\"You have to repeat the message again and again and again before anything gets changed,\" Mr Halfon says.\nHe and Len McCluskey, general secretary of the huge Labour-backing Unite union and a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader, had a \"constructive discussion\" a few years ago, he adds. \nBut what does the TUC - like most of its members officially politically neutral - think?\n\"I've met Robert Halfon on a number of occasions,\" says general secretary Frances O'Grady. \"He's somebody we may not agree with on many things, but he clearly sees a role for trade unions in doing the bread and butter of making sure that people get a fair deal at work. \n\"How others [in the Conservative Party] think, we have yet to find out.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3C46/production/_111103451_mediaitem111103450.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51357589": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51357589", "title": "Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and EU want?", "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:34:10 GMT", "summary": "The UK and EU have set out their stalls for negotiations on their future relationship.", "story": "Trade negotiations tend not to begin with two sides in agreement - otherwise there would be nothing to negotiate. \nSo it's not surprising to see the UK and EU set out rather different positions before talks begin in earnest.  \nThere are some broad similarities. The two sides agree they want a free-trade agreement, with no tariffs (border taxes on goods) or quotas (limits on the amount of goods). They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. \nBut that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. \nTerms and conditions always apply - and there are several possible flashpoints.\nFirst and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition, so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. \nThese are known as level playing field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.  \nMost importantly, its negotiating directives, adopted on 25 February 2020, say a future partnership must \"ensure the application\" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. \nThe UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights in a way that would \"stand the test of time\".\nBut the government has now rejected this approach entirely. The political declaration it agreed with the EU last year did speak of level playing field commitments but, armed with a big majority in the House of Commons, it has toughened up its language.In a document outlining the UK's approach to negotiations published on 27 February 2020, it said: \"we will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU's\".\nInstead, Boris Johnson has said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. \n\"There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,\" he said.\nHe has also pointed out that there are areas such as maternity rights in which the UK has higher standards than the EU and that the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.  \nThe EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada. \nThe UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference, but if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. \nThe government says it will decide in June 2020 \"whether good progress has been possible on the least controversial areas of the negotiations\" (which it defines as things like financial services and data) and if not, it will start to focus on preparing for a new relationship without a formal free-trade deal. \nEither way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January 2021. \nHis critics accuse him of recklessness, but the prime minister says he has \"no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper\".\nThe EU has said an agreement on fisheries must be concluded before any free-trade deal is finalised. That's because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. \nThe UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\". \nThe EU sees things rather differently.\nIts negotiating directives say a future deal should \"aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters\".\nThe EU wants to \"uphold\" existing access on both sides to fishing waters - language that has strengthened under pressure from EU countries with big fishing fleets.\nThe EU also seems prepared to link access to fishing waters to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.  \nBut the UK also rejects that. Michael Gove told Parliament: \"We will take back control of our waters, as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource.\" \nFishing is a tiny part of both sides' economies - in the UK it's well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.  \nWhen it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is a bit more flexible. \n\"We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,\" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. \n\"What I am looking for is consistency.\"\nThe UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so, but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. \nThe more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. \nOne late addition to the EU's negotiating document is the demand that the UK should stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health, which is seen by some as a reference to whether the UK might import chlorine-washed chicken from the US in the future.\nSimilar trade-offs will have to be made in the services sector. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. \nInstead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. \nBut talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. \nIt doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.\nThis is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.   \nMr Johnson has said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.  \nGaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. \nNow, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free-trade agreement. \nIt wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they \"raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law\".\nBut the government's outline says it will not allow \"the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK\".\nThe ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.\nBut a future trade deal is a different matter. \nDevising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. \nIt's not just about trade, it's about internal security co-operation and access to databases too. \n\"Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,\" Michel Barnier said, \"obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full\".\nThe EU's mandate also says there should be \"automatic termination\" of law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe bottom line for the UK?

The difficult part will be working out how to get there and how to implement it.  \nIt is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. \nThere is a long way to go in a short period of time. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F650/production/_110765036_mediaitem110757008.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51679944": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51679944", "title": "The decade that shattered trust in politics", "published": "Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:08:19 GMT", "summary": "Laura Kuenssberg explores the scandals that shook faith in elites at the start of the 21st century.", "story": "Who do you trust? \nThat's no small question. But it's a fundamental one when it comes to politics. \nFor democracy to work well, voters have to have at least a modicum of faith that when politicians are taking decisions they are doing it in our best interests, or at least they are doing what they perceive to be the right thing even if you believe they are wildly wrong. \nThere's little doubt that the agonies of the Brexit process saw trust being stretched to breaking point. \nWhile in such an era of political controversy there has been huge concern, thousands of column inches and hours of discussion on the airwaves about the damage that's been done, the British public didn't just wake up one morning and decide that their politicians were a bunch of charlatans. \nAnd there were plenty of reasons why voters had concerns about whether they could trust them long before a certain campaign group put a certain number on the side of a red bus. \nIt seems a different age, but there were dramatic events in the previous decade that certainly undermined the relationship between the public and those in power. \nAnd in a new documentary, The Decade of Distrust, to be aired on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday evening, we delve into the archive of 2000 to 2010.\nWe revisit the political controversies of the Iraq war, the jaw-dropping revelations of the MPs' expenses scandal, the estimate-busting increase in immigration, the horror of Harold Shipman's murders and, more than anything else, the financial crash, the moment when the foundations of the economy and the basis of our political assumptions simply fell away. \nThe programme takes us from Gordon Brown's living room in Fife and George Osborne's editor's office at the Evening Standard in London back in time. \nIt was almost eerie to talk to those two about how the crash unfolded and the impact it had on our faith in the political system. \nThe former prime minister now believes the people lost trust not because his government made mistakes in handling the crisis, but because they didn't explain to the public what was happening. \nHe told me: 'We didn't communicate properly, and trust was lost because of that. \n\"I look back to Roosevelt who did Saturday night radio broadcasts, I kept thinking what is the medium to get our message across? \n\"People wanted gameshows. Social media was becoming big but we didn't really realise the power of it. \n\"So we didn't get our message across properly, we didn't explain it's a banking crisis, it was worldwide, we had an answer.\" \nGeorge Osborne reflects that the combination of events in those years, the \"rabbit punches of the expenses scandal, and of the bailing out of the banks\" created a climate where people found it harder to trust the government, with consequences we are still living with today, although he jokes that the cartoons he publishes in the paper he edits now are far less rude than those in previous centuries. \nBritish voters have always been a healthily sceptical bunch. \nPoliticians have never exactly been held up as paragons of virtue.  \nBut it is hard for any political generation to restore the public's faith and trust once it has gone, and the first 10 years of this century set the scene for the turmoil in the UK we have just all lived through. \nYou can listen to our documentary tonight on BBC Radio 4 at 2000 GMT and on BBC Sounds afterwards. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/145BB/production/_111078338_duckhouse.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51575095": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51575095", "title": "Brexit: How do you negotiate a trade agreement?", "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2020 01:02:22 GMT", "summary": "There are a lot of negotiations to be done this year.

That is the point of Brexit.\"\nSo what do you need to think about when you're preparing for trade negotiations?\n\"What do you want? That's probably the first thing you have to be absolutely crystal clear on,\" says Emily Jones, who runs the global economic governance programme at the Blavatnik School, at Oxford University.    \n\"There's a lot of trade-offs in doing a trade deal and it's really important to be clear about what your priorities are and how you rank them.\" \nFishing is a good example. It's a tiny part of the overall economy in the UK and the EU but both sides have already insisted they see it as a priority.  \nSo what might either side be willing to concede in one sector to get what they want in another? \nIt's worth remembering most deals are about getting rid of barriers to trade and moving closer together - but this negotiation will be about moving further apart. \nIt's also important to know what the other side at the negotiating table wants to achieve. \nTo do that, you need to understand the politics they are grappling with and the legal and institutional constraints they face. \n\"It's important to think about what the final deal will look like,\" Ms Jones says, \"you have to define the landing zone.\"  \nA deal has to be acceptable to both sides; otherwise - in the end - it will fail. This is the core of the UK's argument that the EU needs to see this as a negotiation between sovereign equals. \nOf course, there will be more lurid headlines on trade in the coming months. \nIn the end though, after all the shouting, when both sides need a deal, there will need to be realism about what can be achieved. \n\"I fear we are not as ready as we would like to be,\" says Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, \"and the time constraint is very binding.\"\n\"We are only going to get a limited number of things done and we should be realistic about that.\"\nMost trade experts believe whatever happens this year, negotiations will have to continue for some time to come.  \n\"The difficult things are where regulations are concerned,\" Mr Winters says.  \n\"So it's services, industrial regulations, food safety, chemicals and so on. It's quite straightforward to cut tariffs to zero; it's all the other stuff that takes time.\"\nThe temptation must be to push things through behind the scenes but recent history suggests too much secrecy in trade negotiations can prompt a hostile reaction. \nIn 2016, tens of thousands of Europeans marched against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a proposed free-trade agreement between the EU and the United States, which has now been abandoned.\n\"There was a huge backlash,\" says Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade law at the solicitors Gowling WLG. And lessons learned then about transparency should be taken on board now. \n\"You may need to keep some of the details secret,\" she says, \"but you need to keep touching base with all your stakeholders - not only with business but with consumers and trades unions as well.\"\nSerious discussions about trade in the UK are confined mostly to expert gatherings or government meetings behind closed doors. \nBy comparison, the US has already held public consultations about a possible trade deal with the UK and the EU has published the detailed text of its draft negotiating mandate. \nIn London, there's certainly a sense of anticipation - and the government says it will set out its plans in more detail in written form. \n\"We've never done anything like this before,\" Mr Winters says. \"In a sense it's very exciting and along with excitement goes a degree of terror.\"\nAnd there are wider issues to consider. \nHow do trade deals fit in with other foreign policy goals such as security or with other domestic priorities such as reducing regional inequality or decarbonising the economy? \n\"We as a society need to have a national conversation about it in the UK,\" says Ms Jones. \n\"My deep concern at the minute is that we're going to be doing trade agreements that lock us in for the medium term or even the long term, without having thought through all the options.\"\nThe post-Brexit transition period runs out at the end of this year, so time really is tight. \nLeaving the single market and the customs union is the biggest economic change this country has made in at least 50 years. \nBut there's no doubt that change does produce opportunities. \nIn his speech in Brussels, Mr Frost said the UK would be able to be far more nimble than the EU in the future and take better advantage of new developments in the global economy. \n\"Britain will be able to experiment, correct mistakes and improve,\" he said. \"The EU is going find this much, much more difficult.\" \nThere are no guarantees at the start of any negotiating process, though, about where it will eventually end up.  \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/91ED/production/_110975373_gettyimages-585605642.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47459859": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47459859", "title": "Driving after Brexit: What you need to know", "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:32:45 GMT", "summary": "What could change for UK drivers abroad after Brexit?", "story": "available from the government As a member of the European Union (EU), UK driving licences could be used to drive in countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) - that means EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\nWhen the UK left the EU on 31 January it entered a transition period during which pretty much everything will stay the same until the end of the year.

According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown.\nAnalysts said the situation could be even worse than the data currently shows, noting the reports of jammed call lines and crashing state websites. Some kinds of workers, such as people working part-time, do not qualify.\n\"I've been writing about the US economy ... since 1996, and this is the single worst data point I've seen, by far,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Economics.\nNationally, the figures are nearly five times higher than the worst point of the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn Illinois, weekly jobless claims increased 10-fold. They more than quintupled in New York and more than tripled in California, which were among the earliest and biggest states to impose restrictions. The effects were even more dramatic in smaller states. \nWhile some retailers, such as Walmart and Amazon, have announced plans to hire, economists said that will not make up for the jobs lost. As incomes evaporate, the economic damage is likely to snowball, since consumer spending accounts for the majority of the US economy.\n\"Once the risks around the virus pass, it will not be just easy to flip the switch and employment returns to pre-crisis levels,\" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM wrote on Twitter. \"That is not how this is going to work and will require more aid.\"\nIn Washington, Congress is expected to pass a more than $2tn (\u00a31.7tn) stimulus bill, which includes direct payments of $1,200 (\u00a3999) to adults, an expansion of unemployment benefits, and financing for affected industries, such as airlines. The Federal Reserve has also taken unprecedented steps to shore up the economy.\nBut even with such action, a sharp economic contraction is inevitable, analysts said. Lower income workers are particularly vulnerable, as the lockdown forces retailers, fast food outlets and other low wage employers to cut back or close. \nMr Shepherdson said he expects to see the unemployment rate increase to at least 6.5% shortly - nearly double the prior rate - and continue to accelerate in future months.\n\"Fed action and fiscal measures can only ameliorate the pain and we remain worried that the latter aren't yet on a sufficient scale,\" Mr Shepherdson wrote.\nAs recently as February, the US unemployment rate was hovering near historic lows at 3.5%. The number of jobless claims was only about 210,000 three weeks ago and President Donald Trump was trumpeting the labour market's health on Twitter.\nBest unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER, almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican, unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nMr Trump, who has made the strength of the economy his political calling card, recently said he wants to loosen restrictions on activity as early as next month.\nHowever, state and local officials worried about the rise in cases may decide not to follow the federal government as the number of cases continues to rise. The US had more than 69,000 cases as of Thursday.\nIn a television interview on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said \"the first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity\".\n\"The sooner we get through this period and get the virus under control, the sooner the recovery can come...We know that economic activity will decline probably substantially in the second quarter but I think many expect and I would expect economic activity to resume and move back up in the second half of the year,\" he said.\nMore than 3 million Americans lost their jobs in a week - a single week - and it is possible this number is underestimating the actual figure. \nTo think just a few weeks ago, the monthly jobless rate was at a 50-year low and we were talking about the continuing strength of the US labour market. Now some experts are expecting to see the unemployment rate hit 13% or more.\nIt is incredible just how quickly the American economy has cratered. So it comes as no surprise that President Trump wants to reopen the country for business fast. \nThis is a president that staked his reputation partly on the strength of the US economy, often highlighting low unemployment and a record breaking stock market. \nNow, in an election year, he can point to neither.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/50B7/production/_111436602_gettyimages-1208243726.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52053565": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52053565", "title": "Coronavirus: NHS uses tech giants to plan crisis response", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:32:04 GMT", "summary": "Amazon and Microsoft are among those helping with a dashboard to model where ventilators should go.", "story": "Data collected gathered via the NHS's 111 telephone service is to be mixed with other sources to help predict where ventilators, hospital beds, and medical staff will be most in need.\nThe goal is to help health chiefs model the consequences of moving resources to best tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\nThree US tech firms are aiding the effort - Amazon, Microsoft and Palantir - as well as London-based Faculty AI.\nThe plan is expected to be signed off by Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\"Every hospital is going to be thinking: Have we got enough ventilators?

She had a similar experience with a delivery from ethical toilet roll company Who Gives A Crap.\nShe's had a subscription with the firm for about six months. She believes that the \u00a336 package of 48 rolls, which was clearly labelled as toilet paper, was stolen.\nThe Australian firm, which uses half of its profits to help build toilets in developing countries, told the BBC: \"We've seen a small increase in concerns that deliveries may have been stolen, but nothing drastic. In most cases we are finding that the delivery just hasn't been completed yet.\"\nAvant Garde Brands, which sells household products on Ebay and Wowcher, told one UK customer that it was starting to receive reports of toilet roll deliveries going missing too.\n It said that the coronavirus pandemic had led to an \"unprecedented\" spike in demand for retailers. \nShoppers are turning to online shops and more niche toilet paper companies so that they aren't caught short.\nBumboo offers subscriptions for its toilet rolls made from bamboo. For every box purchased online, it plants a tree. \nAlthough the firm has only been trading for seven full months, managing director Fay Pottinger said that sales had gone \"crazy\" since the beginning of March, when \"the full impact of panic buying set in\".\nShe told the BBC that so far this month, sales have jumped by about 325% against the last. She adds this could have been much higher, had the company not run out of stock.\nUS firm No. 2, which also sells bamboo toilet paper, said that in the month-to-date, it had seen more than a 5,000% increase in its sales on Amazon's website before it sold out too.\nMeanwhile, Who Gives A Crap's chief executive Simon Griffiths said that at the beginning of March, sales were up to five times higher than on an average February day.\nHe added that although consumers might be worried, \"it's important to show compassion to each other right now, including to delivery drivers who are out there every day ensuring people can get basic necessities delivered to home\".\nBeing stuck on the toilet with only one square left is seemingly one scenario most panic buyers are trying to avoid.\nDr Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a consumer psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University, says when people are anxious, \"they need to do something practical to make it feel like they are in control\".\nThe focus on toilet roll \"likely started on the basis of some people trying to be practical in that they wanted to stock up on basics in case they could not go out. There's then been a snowball effect as consumers observed each other stockpiling - they also had to do it.\"\nShe adds that seeing photos of empty shelves online \"further fuels a vicious circle\".\nWhile stockpiling might ease some consumers' anxieties around the virus, people need to remember to stay \"community-minded\", said Tony Richards of Essity, \n.\nHe reassured consumers: \"Don't panic...we can get toilet roll on the shelves.

Or because kids need to go to school online, you might buy them a tablet or Chromebook.\"\nThe new handsets were unveiled via a livestreamed video feed rather than at one of the big-budget events Huawei typically hosts.\nUnlike last year's models, the P40 phones lack Google services - including its YouTube, Maps and Play Store apps, and the Google Assistant - because of a US trade ban. \nThat makes them a difficult sale outside of China, where Android phones come preinstalled with alternatives.\nBut as a result, one company-watcher suggested that the firm might actually be in a better place to deal with the consequences of Covid-19 than its rivals.\n\"Huawei was already pretty much locked out of markets outside of China, and had factored in a pretty tough trading environment for the next year or two,\" explained Ben Wood from CCS Insight.\n\"So, it is other phone-makers that have a bigger shock to deal with. LG and Sony's smartphone divisions, in particular, were already sub-scale and may not survive.\n\"And don't forget, that the majority of Huawei's sales are still coming from its home market in China, where it's been selling over 40 million units on a quarterly basis. And that market is recovering faster than others having already endured coronavirus and seems to be coming out the other side.\"\nHuawei remains the world's second bestselling handset-maker, but had once aimed to overtake Samsung before the end of 2019.Founder Ren Zhengfei told the Wall Street Journal that his firm now planned to boost its wider research and development budget by $5.8bn (\u00a34.8bn) this year, taking it to more than $20bn. And part of that is being spent on building up its own library of apps.\n\"In markets outside of China, we don't see significant [smartphone] growth,\" he added.\n\"We are taking measures to address that.\"\nThere are three versions of the new phones: the standard P40, with a 6.1in screen, and a larger mid-range P40 Pro and high-end Pro+, which both have 6.58in displays. That makes then slightly bigger than Apple's iPhone 11 Pro Max.\nAll support 5G. The basic model has three rear cameras, including one that is capable of a 3x optical zoom - meaning users can tighten in on the subject without sacrificing quality.\nThe P40 Pro adds a time-of-flight depth sensor and upgrades the telephoto lens to a periscope design, allowing light to be reflected into the device to deliver a 5x optical zoom. \nAnd the Pro+ betters this with a 10x optical zoom periscope lens. If a digital effect is employed, the Pro+ can achieve 100x zoom. This matches Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra - but Huawei claims to produce a better shot.\nHuawei also said its phones featured bigger camera sensors than those found in either the Galaxy S20 series or iPhone 11 range, giving it an advantage in low-light situations when the owner does not want to use the flash. \nOther standout features include:\nThe Huawei App Gallery includes TikTok, Telegram, Viber, and Microsoft Office among other products. But beyond Google's apps, it is also missing Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.\nTo help make up for the loss of YouTube, the firm has created its own Huawei Video app. \nIt has signed a deal with BBC Studios to provide access to 300 hours of content.\nHuawei Video will include BBC drama, comedy and factual TV shows in 26 countries outside the UK. \nAnd to replace the Duo video chat app, it offers MeeTime, which it claims offers superior performance in low-light conditions.\n\"The design of the devices is superb - they are very sleek,\" commented Ms Pinto.\n\"And it's clever that they've been able to bring more stability to the ultra-zoom lens than Samsung did with its S20 Ultra, assuming the P40 Pro+ lives up to its promise.\n\"But it remains a hard sell, because would you actually want to use something like MeeTime rather than WhatsApp?\"\nThe P40 and P40 Pro go on sale on 7 April, and start from \u20ac799 (\u00a3742, $890) and \u20ac999 respectively, The P40 Pro+ will be released in June, and is priced at \u20ac1,399.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p087sdws.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52043896": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52043896", "title": "Banks under fire for coronavirus loan tactics", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 10:31:19 GMT", "summary": "MPs have criticised banks for asking business owners to put their own property up to secure loans.", "story": "Banks have been criticised by firms and MPs for insisting on personal guarantees to issue government-backed emergency loans to business owners. \nThe requirement loads most of the risk that the loan goes bad on the business owner, rather than the banks. \nIt means that the banks can go after the personal property of the owner of a firm if their business goes under and they cannot afford to pay off the debt.\nTheir main home would be protected but the bank could go after other assets.\nThose can include things like personal savings, shares or holiday homes. And some think that will stop business owners from making use of the emergency loan scheme, which the government put in place to stop businesses from going under during the coronavirus crisis.\nThe coronavirus business interruption loans (CBIL) are a key plank of the government's package to protect businesses throughout the ongoing shutdown.\nAlex Harris owns bar Behind This Wall in Hackney, east London. He told the BBC's Today programme that he asked his bank about the government's coronavirus loan scheme, but was offered something quite different.\n\"The government-backed loans are from \u00a325,000 up to \u00a35m,\" he said. \"We got offered a financial product of theirs, another loan which is not part of the coronavirus package.\n\"It's for up to \u00a324,999, but will come at up to 22% interest, which would initially bankrupt my business.\"\nMr Harris said he was being asked to borrow against his house and questioned why he was being asked to do so, \"faced with this level of uncertainty\".\nStephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, advised Mr Harris to contact the British Business Bank (BBB), which is overseeing the scheme, to look for another lender.\nHe told the programme that no-one borrowing money under the government's coronavirus loan scheme would be required to use their main private residence as security.\nThe BBB has told lenders they have discretion over the security they require.\nAccording to UK Finance, formerly the British Bankers Association, the scheme should offer loans of up to \u00a35m, where the government promises to cover 80% of losses if the money is not repaid. But, it notes: \"Lenders may require security for the facility.\"\nAnd that could allow banks to repossess the owner's personal property as well as the assets of the business if the firm goes under. \nBarclays has told customers they will be required to sign personal guarantees to access the government-supported emergency finance. And HSBC told the BBC it will require a form of personal guarantee for loans over \u00a3100,000. \nHowever, Royal Bank of Scotland, which also owns NatWest, has confirmed it will offer business interruption loans without asking business owners for personal guarantees - proving that more generous terms can be offered. \nThe other banks will now come under pressure from business customers to copy RBS.\nPersonal guarantees allow banks to lend more because it means they are more likely to get their money back. That means they don't have to put as much money aside to cover failures, which is one of the biggest costs for a bank.\nBut the use of personal guarantees shifts the risk from the bank and the government on to the business owner themselves.\nIf a loan of \u00a3100,000 was made to a failed business and the owner had signed a personal guarantee, the bank would first repossess the assets of the owner or the business. Only then would the government step in to cover 80% of whatever loss remained and the bank would only have to fund whatever was left after that.\nBusiness owners and MPs say that is not fair when the firms themselves are only seeking the loans because of emergency measures introduced by the government.\nThe SME Alliance, which represents small and medium sized enterprises and is led by business owner Andy Keats, said that while business owners were grateful for the recognition that most firms will need help to survive the crisis, \"yet again, it is the banks and not businesses who will receive the funds to help SMEs\".\nIt said banks were seeking security - property they can repossess if the loan is not repaid - for the entire value of the business interruption loans.\n\"We would appreciate some clarity because, as things stand, the proposed loans mean the banks have no risk, the government has a small risk and businesses and their officers have 100% risk,\" said Mr Keats. \nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking tweeted: \"There is confusion about [coronavirus business interruption loan schemes]. Treasury must issue clear guidance on parameters and not allow security at 'discretion of the lender' to muddy the waters. Unprecedented times require emergency funding. Keep it simple, and no [personal guarantees].\"\nKevin Hollinrake MP, a former business owner who chairs the group, said: \"I asked the chief secretary to the Treasury [Steve Barclay] in the House of Commons - does the new scheme include personal guarantees and he said it was his understanding that it would not.

people are 2m (6.5ft) apart, but critics say this is impossible to enforce, and that public health should come first.\nTaylor Wimpey, which builds over 10,000 homes a year,  said this week that it was

the confusion, construction trade groups are currently giving differing advice to members.  \nThe National Federation of Builders, which represents small-to-medium sized contractors, said builders could work on sites if they followed safety guidelines, but the Federation of Master Builders said they should only go in if it is for emergency work.  \n\"While we accept the government's advice to keep sites open, we have concerns about how this would be applied in practice,\" FMB boss Brian Berry said.  \nFormer Tory cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith joined those calling for a pause to all

the self-employed and will announce a package of support on Thursday at the government's daily press conference, a government source told the BBC.\nTaylor Wimpey said it was looking at how to support its around 2,000 directly employed staff, but had no plans for the \"sizable number\" of self employed freelancers on its sites.  \n\"They are generally not actually operating for us, they are

The US has confirmed more than 55,000 cases, the third highest of any country after China and Italy.\nThe US Congress has approved a $2tn rescue bill - the biggest package of support for the economy in modern American history.\nLike the UK's emergency economic measures, it offers $350bn in loans for small businesses to cover expenses for up to 10 weeks; it also offers $500bn in aid to airlines and other corporations. The government is also sending out cheques of $1,200 for every adult and $500 per child.\nBut there's concern that the package, for all its huge size, simply isn't big enough to soften the scale of the economic shock caused by the Covid-19 shutdown, now a global phenomenon.

They will be liable to repay the money in full - the guarantee is for the lenders, not the borrowers.\nNot necessarily, Firms will have to prove that they are viable businesses which have been trading successfully, but just need extra support to deal with short term difficulties caused by the current disruption. Some firms may not be successful. \nThe money will be provided by more than 40 lenders who have signed up to the scheme, including High Street banks like Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest, as well as more specialist finance companies. \nBusinesses are asked to contact their own bank first (if they are taking part in the scheme) via the company website if possible, and only approach other lenders if they need to. \nThe British Business Bank, which is running the scheme, told the BBC on 23 March that it expected money to start flowing \"this week\".\nYou can read more about how the scheme will work here.\nYes, The British Business Bank says self-employed people with an annual turnover of up to \u00a345m can apply under the scheme, as long as they operate through a business bank account, and generate more than 50% of their turnover from trading activity.\nThis includes sole traders, freelancers, and limited partnerships, operating in all sectors.  \nThe government has already said the UK's five million self-employed people would be allowed to defer self-assessment tax payments, and would benefit from mortgage payment holidays as well as an expansion of welfare support, including universal credit and Local Housing Allowance. \nHM Treasury told the BBC the government was \"working hard on further measures to support the self-employed\".\nCompanies that have a yearly turnover of more than \u00a345m may be able to take advantage of the Bank of England's new Covid Corporate Financing Facility. \nThe Corporate Financing Facility is effectively a government promise to buy short-term IOUs from companies which are in sound financial health and have a very high credit rating, but which need help to boost their cash flows. \nThe IOUs can be for any period between one week and 12 months. \nThe Bank of England says that eligible companies must have a \"genuine business\" in the UK, and \"make a material contribution to the UK economy\". \nGenerally they will be based in the UK, or have their headquarters here, and employ or provide services to a significant number of people in the country.\nCompanies must apply through their own bank in the first instance, assuming it is taking part in the scheme, and need to request funding of at least \u00a31m.\nThe facility will offer finance to companies on similar terms to those available in the markets in the period before the pandemic. \nThe government will not publish details of which firms have taken advantage of the scheme, which is due to run for at least 12 months. \nYou can read more about how the scheme will work here:.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CA97/production/_98536815_mediaitem98536814.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51628524": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51628524", "title": "Coronavirus: Wages, sick pay and time off explained", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:49:30 GMT", "summary": "What is happening to workers' wages and sick pay during the coronavirus outbreak?", "story": "Most of the wages of employees who are not working and otherwise would have lost their jobs during the coronavirus outbreak are being covered by the government.\nCompanies can receive grants to pay their workers 80% of their salaries - up to a limit of \u00a32,500 a month.\nEmployers have been urged not to cut jobs. Benefits payments are also to be increased. \nA similar package is now in place for the self-employed.\nThe intervention comes after people were told to work from home if they could.\nWith schools shutting, parents are having to work more flexibly, and self-isolation puts more pressure on businesses who have staff coming in.\nSick pay rules have been amended, and the self-employed will see their tax liabilities delayed.\nIf you are still employed but do not currently have work, the plan is that you will still get your wages.\nYour employer will be able to access grants, by the end of April, from the UK's tax authority to allow them to keep paying you.The typical worker is paid \u00a3585 a week, on a median average (which is the middle point of all workers), according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is about \u00a32,340 a month.\nThe government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nThese will be backdated to March and the scheme will last three months at least. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment.\nNo, this is for those who are on the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. \nSelf-employed people will receive support from another system.\nThose on working-age benefits will see a more generous Universal Credit system, rising by about \u00a320 a week for the next year. The same rise will be given to those still on the working tax credit system. The government says this will benefit more than four million of the lowest-income households.\nPublic sector workers are not covered because most of them have their wages paid directly by the government.\nEveryone who can work from home should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined, and staff should receive their normal pay.\nHowever, this puts various new responsibilities on an employer - for example, they are responsible for equipment they supply, and must say what it should be used for.\nThe question of who covers the running costs should ideally be outlined as soon as possible, as should how any extra expenses should be covered.\nAn employer has a duty of care for staff, even if they are working at home. \nThe requirements of the health and safety legislation apply to homeworkers too, according to the employment conciliation service Acas, which has set out guidance for employers and employees.\nWhen your children's school is closed, or if you have a relative who is ill, your employer must give you time off to look after them.\nBut your employer is not forced to pay you unless your contract requires it.\nHowever, many employers are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare.\nKey workers, who have been defined by the government, can still send children to school or nursery.\nYou may do through sick pay which varies from company to company.\nMany employees will have contracts that allow them their normal pay while they are unable to work because they are sick.\nEven where people do not get their fully paid sick leave, or if they work in jobs where they do not have contractual sick leave, there may be minimum payments they can rely on, known as statutory sick pay.Statutory sick pay (SSP) is money paid by employers, so self-employed workers are not eligible, but casual or agency workers are. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that SSP would be paid to people who need to be off as they or their family have symptoms. People should be able to obtain a sick note from the NHS 111 service rather than getting one from a GP.\nThe rules were also changed so that those people would be eligible for SSP on their first day away from work, instead of having to wait until the fourth day as used to be the case.\nHe also announced that businesses with fewer than 250 employees would be able to claim back from the government two weeks of SSP paid to staff affected by coronavirus. \nIt is set at \u00a394.25 a week, although of course employers could pay more if they want to.\nTo get SSP people need to be earning at least \u00a3118 a week. Many people such as those on zero-hours contracts - who work variable hours every week - may earn less than this. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has calculated that there are two million workers who are not eligible for SSP.\nWe asked the Office for National Statistics to check this figure and they estimated that there were 1,766,000 jobs done by adults in the UK that paid less than \u00a3118 a week. \nThe number of people involved is likely to be somewhat lower than this because one person could have more than one of these jobs. And indeed, if somebody has more than one of these jobs it could take them above the \u00a3118 a week needed to qualify. \nAbout 70% of these jobs are done by women.\nFor self-employed people who have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant will be paid worth 80% of their average monthly profits over the last three years - up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month.\nInitially, this will be available for three months in one lump-sum payment, and will start to be paid from June.\nIt will be called the Coronavirus Self-employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, are still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year.\nHowever, not all the self-employed are eligible.\nMeanwhile, the government has said it will make it \"quicker and easier\" for self-employed people seeing a sudden drop in income to access benefits.\nThe chancellor said that those on contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) will be able to claim from day one, instead of day eight.\nHe has removed the minimum income floor.

Damage is being done now, so we need help now.\"\nThe Federation of Small Businesses also warned the delay in wages help - potentially until the end of April - meant many small firms would still face \"an immediate, potentially terminal cash flow crunch\".\nThe government has faced huge pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as anti-virus measures have seen many firms' revenues evaporate almost overnight.  \nThe wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees.\nHowever, there was not the same wages guarantee for the self-employed. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on.\nOther measures to support firms and workers included:\nCapital Economics said that it expected the unemployment rate to rise from just under 4% to about 6% due to the crisis. However, without this latest government intervention, that rate would have risen to the financial crisis level of 8%, it said.\nThis move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns.\nIn theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do.\nAt 80% cent of wages up to \u00a32,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation.\nIt shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact.\nThe chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt.\nThere are risks if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater.\nNow it requires employers to hold their nerve until the payments begin at the end of next month.

Its spread has left businesses around the world counting costs.\nHere is a selection of maps and charts to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far.\nBig shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts (ISAs).\nThe FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on 31 December.\nThe Dow and the FTSE have seen their biggest one day declines since 1987.\nInvestors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline. \nIn response, central banks in many countries have cut interest rates. \nThat should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy.The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are among those to slash interest rates.\nThe travel industry has been badly damaged, with airlines cutting flights and tourists cancelling business trips and holidays.\nGovernments around the world have introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus.\nThe EU is banning travellers from outside the bloc for 30 days in an unprecedented move to seal its borders because of the coronavirus crisis.\nThe analytics firm ForwardKeys has estimated  that up to 48,200 flights with 10.2 million seats could be affected by the ban, with the biggest impact falling on Air France.\nIn the US, the Trump administration has banned travellers from European airports from entering the US.\nUK travel industry experts have expressed concerns about Chinese tourists being kept at home. There were 415,000 visits from China to the UK in the 12 months to September 2019, according to VisitBritain. Chinese travellers also spend three times more on an average visit to the UK at \u00a31,680 each.\nFear of the virus and government advice to stay at home is also having a devastating impact on hotels and restaurants.\nIn China, where the coronavirus first appeared, industrial production, sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.\nChina makes up a third of manufacturing globally, and is the world's largest exporter of goods.\nChina's industrial slowdown has even been visible from space.\nNasa said pollution-monitoring satellites had detected a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide over the country. Evidence suggests that's \"at least partly\" due to the economic slowdown caused by the outbreak.\nRestrictions have affected the supply chains of big companies such as industrial equipment manufacturer JCB and carmaker Nissan. \nShops and car dealerships have all reported a fall in demand.\nChinese car sales, for example, dropped by 92% during the first half of February. More carmakers, like Tesla or Geely, are now selling cars online as customers stay away from showrooms.\nWhen a crisis hits, investors often choose less risky investments.\nGold is traditionally considered a \"safe haven\" for investment in times of uncertainty. \nUntil March the price of gold increased. But now, with investors increasingly fearful about a global recession, even the price of gold has tumbled.\nLikewise, oil has slumped to its lowest price since June 2001.\nInvestors fear that the global spread of the virus will further hit the global economy and demand for oil.\nThe oil price had already been affected by a row between Opec, the group of oil producers, and Russia. Coronavirus has driven the price down further.\nIf the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs.\nIt's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year.\nThe world's economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the coronavirus outbreak, \nThe think tank has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November.\nIt also said that a \"longer lasting and more intensive\" outbreak could halve growth to 1.5% in 2020 as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to contain the virus.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/115CC/production/_111361117_coronavirus_economic_impact_976_v2-nc.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51737030": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51737030", "title": "Coronavirus: Can supermarkets provide regular online deliveries?", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:07:25 GMT", "summary": "Boris Johnson asked people to rely on online shopping, but all slots are fully booked at the moment.", "story": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the nation to stay at home and - apart from essential trips to the shops - \nHowever, supermarkets' online delivery services seem to have no spare slots, and special schemes to prioritise elderly and vulnerable customers are facing issues.\nSo how can Britain buy food easily?\nThe good news is that there is no shortage of food for everyone.

Unfortunately these weren't available to buy in Kenya at the time, so Michelle started to order them from the US and Europe.\nAs this was very expensive, she started to make her own shampoos, conditioners, and other products, in her bathroom, using ingredients such as avocado, egg, rosemary water, and aloe vera.\n\"When I gave them to friends to test, they just loved them,\" she says. \"I realised that selling natural hair products could become a viable business.\"\nToday her Nairobi-based company - Marini Naturals - sells 50,000 bottles and tubs a month across 12 countries, 10 in Africa, plus Turkey and France.\nWhile Michelle says that her parents taught her the importance of \"working hard and following your dreams\", they were also able to give her an upbringing far more comfortable than most Kenyans enjoy.\nHer father, who passed away in 2014, was a businessman, and the boss of Kenya's financial regulator, the Capital Markets Authority. Meanwhile, her mother worked for the United Nations.\n\"My parents were always very driven in terms of career and education,\" she says.\nAfter school, Michelle got a degree in design and communications from the University of Nairobi, and then spent time in Italy where she got a master's in interior design from the Florence Design Academy in Italy.\nReturning to Kenya, she first worked for an IT company. She then joined the pan-African advertising agency Sanad Africa.\nHowever, she had long wanted to set up her own business, and while at Sanad she launched her own branding agency, called Brandvine Group. She ran this together with her best friend Niyati Patel, who would become her co-founder at Marini.\n\"I always wanted to start my own company, because I love to build something up from scratch,\" says Michelle.\nLaunching Marini in 2015, Michelle says she soon realised that she faced \"a heck of a job\" to convince Kenyan women to give up their chemical hair straighteners, and instead embrace their natural curls.\nShe says that she was fighting against the accepted wisdom. \"Most cosmetic scientists claimed that the African market wasn't ready for natural hair products, as most African women were still convinced that their natural hair couldn't be beautiful,\" she says.\nBut determined to both change matters, and make a success of Marini, Michelle decided to make some videos, and launch a campaign on YouTube. Using 30 models she showcased more than 50 natural hairstyles created using the company's products.\n\"It became a huge success,\" she says. \"People all over the continent shared our videos on social media, and our YouTube tutorials became an important part of our marketing strategy.\"\nWhat helped to boost sales was that Michelle was able to say that all the ingredients were made in Africa, such as coconut oil from Kenya, shea butter from Uganda, and natural fragrances from South Africa. However, the packaging is from China, as Michelle says that, disappointingly, she was not able to find bottles and tubs of sufficient quality within Africa.\nAlready selling Marini Naturals outside of Africa in France and Turkey, Michelle now has her eye on further global expansion. She says that there is growing interest in her products as more men and women of African descent decide to give up straightening their hair.\n\"Thanks to this increasing global demand we now want to scale Marini [more into] Europe, and into the US,\" she says.\nThe company also plans to start exporting its new range of skincare products.\nMichelle says that while she gets her biggest satisfaction from positive customer feedback, her late father is often in her thoughts.\n\"I miss him very much,\" she says. \"Maybe Marini Naturals was his gift to me before he left.\n\"To be able to translate that into a product that is changing lives of millions of women, men and children around the world is extremely fulfilling.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p087l0d6.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51657573": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51657573", "title": "Could synthetic fish be a better catch of the day?", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 01:38:07 GMT", "summary": "Start-ups are growing fish \"meat\" in labs and say it will be competitive with fish from the sea.", "story": "Overfishing has depleted numbers of wild fish, and fish farms meet much of the growing demand.

The notion of hunting in the 21st century to feed 10 billion people is absurd.\"\nFish farms like Sterling Caviar are helping take pressure off wild stocks, but a handful of start-up firms think they might have another answer.\nThey are experimenting with growing fish \"meat\" in the lab. \nMainly based in Silicon Valley with a couple in Europe and Asia, they have developed techniques to extract fish stem cells and grow them into commercial quantities of edible flesh. \nStem cells are a type of cell, found in embryos or adult creatures - which can grow into a number of different specialised cells. They can grow into the muscle cells which make up most the parts of fish people like to eat.\n\"Picture it like 3D printing, but we're 3D printing fish,\" explains Michael Selden, chief executive and co-founder of lab-grown fish start-up Finless Foods.\nHis company's faux fish will come out as ground fish as opposed to whole fillets because developing, from scratch, skin and bone and blood isn't yet  feasible.\nFinless Foods and similar start-ups haven't yet commercialised their products and they still require approval from regulators, so their fish might not be on the market for two or three years.\nWild Type, based in San Francisco, has similar ambitions, but it is focused on Pacific salmon. Making fish in a lab sounds like it could be pricey for both producer and consumer, but chief executive Justin Kolbeck hopes to make the fish affordable at some point.\n\"Our goal is to eventually drive down the price of our salmon to have its price run lower than conventionally-harvested salmon.\"\nShiok Meats in Singapore has trained its eyes on lab-grown crustaceans such as shrimp.\nIt creates lab-grown fish by taking a small sample of stem cells from a real shrimp and growing them in large quantities in a large bioreactor chamber, similar to the huge stainless steel tanks brewers use to manufacture beer.\nThe tanks maintain a constant pressure and temperature and bathe the cells in gases and a nutrient-rich liquid. After a couple weeks the meat is ready.\n\"[It's] the same meat that would have come from a slaughtered animal but with no animal slaughter in this case,\" say Sandhya Sriram, chief executive and co-founder of Shiok Meats.\nThe company plans to launch its minced shrimp product in 2021, distributing it first in Singapore and then across East Asia.\nShe is excited about dubbing his firm's product \"clean meat\" due to the lack of antibiotics and lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to traditional farming.\nHowever, the environmental claims have yet to be fully verified.\nWhile cell-based meats have a smaller carbon footprint than traditional protein sources, they will still require \"a lot\" of electricity, says Simon Somogyi, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.\n\"Where is that energy is coming from? Are they using carbonized or renewable energy?\" he asks.\nStill, Mr Somogyi thinks lab-grown fish is perhaps an even more promising market than lab-grown beef.\n\"Fish has a better business case going forward than red meat because much of the volume of finned fish is turned into minced fish, and put into food such as fish fingers and fish burgers. Cell-based fish fits perfectly into that category.\"\nWild Type's Mr Kolbeck envisions a future where fish lovers will have similar options to meat (and meat-alternative) eaters.\n\"From real meat to plant-based substitutes to cell-based meat... one company won't be the winner, but rather the winner will be increased choice and transparency in our food systems.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6C86/production/_111128772_wilton_loading_fish.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51950286": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51950286", "title": "'I bought a winery and it caused a US-French row'", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 00:13:42 GMT", "summary": "When US entrepreneur Michael Baum bought a famous French vineyard it caused a trans-Atlantic spat.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

Half of them were 'damn foreigners stealing our heritage'. the other half were 'if it wasn't for Americans you'd all be eating sauerkraut right now'.\n\"So you can say it was pretty divisive.\" \nThis was back in 2014, when Michael purchased Chateau de Pommard and its 25 hectares (62 acres) of vines for an undisclosed sum in the many millions. \nHe could afford the price because he had made a fortune in Silicon Valley, most notably as the founder and former chief executive of a software company hardly any of us have heard of - Splunk.  \nIt is complicated stuff, but in simple terms, its software allows firms to monitor their data and security systems. With annual revenues of $1.8bn (\u00a31.6bn), Splunk's customers are many of the world's largest companies. They include 92 of the Fortune 100 list of the biggest 100 businesses in the US by annual turnover. \nMichael and his two co-founders launched Splunk back in 2003, and today it is a listed company with a market capitalisation (the combined value of all its shares) of more than than $16bn.

Then, following a visit to the college by the late Steve Jobs, everyone purchased an Apple computer. \n\"All of a sudden my brain went 'how do these work?',\" says Michael. \"So I went headlong into software.\" \nSwitching his main university course from electrical engineering to computer science, it set him on an entrepreneurial career path in tech sector. \nAfter graduating, Michael's first business venture was a software system for investors that studied past stock market conditions to try to predict future performance. Called Reality Online, it was ultimately purchased by the Reuters business information company. \nThen armed with a master of business qualification from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, he moved to Silicon Valley. \nOther businesses he successfully grew and sold included a software system for early handheld computer devices, called Pensoft, and online money exchange firm Dotbank. \nHowever, living in California, America's main wine growing state, he didn't like American wine. \n\"I didn't think I liked wine when I was a younger man, because I didn't like the American stuff,\" he says. \"It is more often too heavy, too sweet, too alcoholic. \n\"Then I went to Europe for the first time when I was 28, and tried French wine for the first time. And it was a huge revelation. \n\"French wine is far more elegant, far more mineral, far more traditionally made. It is night and day. \n\"Then in 2012 we [my wife and I] moved to Paris for a year, just to take a hiatus, and I started looking more intensely at doing something in wine in France. We went to Burgundy, and I was like 'this is it, this is ground zero, this is the benchmark'. I fell hard for Burgundy wines.\" \nHome to some of the most expensive, and highly-prized wines in the world, Burgundy predominately produces white wines made from chardonnay grapes, and reds made from pinot noir. The wineries and vineyards are often very small, with some producers owning just a few rows or plots of vines here and there. \nLocated some 300km (180 miles) south east of Paris, the region was until recent years informally closed off to foreign investment because the existing French owners get first refusal on any neighbouring wineries, vineyards and plots that come up for sale. And they are mostly snapped up. \nFor this reason, overseas investment in French wine has historically been focused on the far larger Bordeaux area, near the Atlantic coast in the south west of the country. \nMichael was able to buy Chateau de Pommard, and become the first American to buy a winery in Burgundy, thanks to a bit of luck - the previous owner had based the firm that controlled it in Luxembourg rather than France. \nHe now divides his time between Burgundy and Silicon Valley. \"It is fun to go back and forth, and experience two dramatically different worlds,\" he says. \nSince Michael invested in Burgundy, another American has followed suite - sports billionaire Stan Kroenke, the owner of the LA Rams American football team, and England's Arsenal FC. \nTom Ashworth, chief executive of UK wine merchants Yapp Brothers, says there is growing international interest in buying top Burgundy wineries, because the wines they produce have surged in global popularity in recent years. \n\"It's not too surprising that as wine investors have turned their attention from buying bottles of Bordeaux to bottles of Burgundy over the past decade, so billionaires are pocketing the domaines themselves,\" says Mr Ashworth. \nHe adds that it also helps that the most prestigious sub region of Burgundy - the Cote d'Or - is far more picturesque than the main vineyard area of Bordeaux. \nBut if Michael had to pick just one region - Silicon Valley or Burgundy - which would it be? \n\"They are like chocolate and peanut butter, I like them both together,\" he says.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/716A/production/_111343092_michaelbaum_harvest_copyrightfamillecarabello-baum2018.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51914722": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51914722", "title": "Coronavirus: Robots use light beams to zap hospital viruses", "published": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 00:05:14 GMT", "summary": "Demand has surged for robots equipped with powerful ultraviolet lights that can kill viruses.", "story": "\"Please leave the room, close the door and start a disinfection,\" says a voice from the robot.\n\"It says it in Chinese as well now,\" Simon Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, tells me as he demonstrates the machine.\nThrough a glass window we watch as the self-driving machine navigates a mock-hospital room, where it kills microbes with a zap of ultraviolet light.\n\"We had been growing the business at quite a high pace - but the coronavirus has kind of rocketed the demand,\" says chief executive, Per Juul Nielsen.\nHe says \"truckloads\" of robots have been shipped to China, in particular Wuhan. Sales elsewhere in Asia, and Europe are also up.\n\"Italy has been showing a very strong demand,\" adds Mr Nielsen. \"They really are in a desperate situation. Of course, we want to help them.\"\nProduction has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark's third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub.\nGlowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can't multiply.\nIt's also hazardous to humans, so we wait outside. The job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there's a smell, much like burned hair.\n\"There are a lot of problematic organisms that give rise to infections,\" explains Prof Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology, at the University of Southern Denmark, which helped develop the robot.\n\"If you apply a proper dose of ultraviolet light in a proper period of time, then you can be pretty sure that you get rid of your organism.\"\nHe adds: \"This type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\"\nThe robot was launched in early 2019, following six years of collaboration between parent firm, Blue Ocean Robotics and Odense University Hospital where Prof Kolmos has overseen infection control.\nCosting $67,000 (\u00a353,370) each, the robot was designed to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) which can be costly to treat and cause loss of life.\nWhile there's been no specific testing to prove the robot's effectiveness against coronavirus, Mr Nielsen is confident it works.\n\"Coronavirus is very similar to other viruses like Mers and Sars. And we know that they are being killed by UV-C light,\" he says.\nDr Lena Ciric, an associate professor at University College London and expert on molecular biology, agrees that UV disinfection robots can help fight coronavirus. \nDisinfection robots are no \"silver bullet\", says Dr Ciric. But she adds: \"These [machines] provide an extra line of defence.\"\n\"We're in the run up to having a lot of coronavirus patients in the various hospitals. I think it's wise to be on top of the cleaning regimes\u2026 from an infection control point of view. \"\nTo be fully effective, UV needs to fall directly on a surface. If lightwaves are blocked by dirt or obstacles, such shadow areas won't be disinfected. Therefore manual cleaning is needed first. \nUV light has been used for decades in water and air purification, and used in laboratories.\nBut combining them with autonomous robots is a recent development.\nAmerican firm Xenex has LightStrike, which has to be manually put in place, and delivers high-intensity UV light from a U-shaped bulb.\nThe company has seen a surge in orders from Italy, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.\nXenex says numerous studies show that it's effective at reducing hospital-acquired infections and combating so-called superbugs. In 2014, one Texan hospital used it in the clean-up after an Ebola case.\nMore than 500 healthcare facilities, mostly in the US, have the machine. In California and Nebraska, it has already been put to use sanitising hospital rooms where coronavirus patients received treatment, the manufacturer says.\nIn China, where the outbreak began, there has been an adoption of new technology to help fight the disease.\nThe nation is already the highest spender on drones and robotics systems, according to a report from global research firm IDC.\nLeon Xiao, Senior Research Manager at IDC China says robots have been used for a range of tasks, primarily disinfection, deliveries of drugs, medical devices and waste removal, and temperature-checking.More Technology of Business'I think this is a breakthrough for greater use of robotics both for hospitals and other public places,\" says Mr Xiao. However space in hospitals to deploy robots and acceptance by staff are challenges, he says.\nThe coronavirus has spurred home-grown Chinese robotics companies to innovate.\nShenzhen-based YouiBot was already making autonomous robots, and quickly adapted its technology to make a disinfection device.\n\"We're trying to do something [to help], like every one here in China,\" says YouiBot's Keyman Guan.\nThe startup adapted its existing robotic base and software, adding thermal cameras and UV-C emitting bulbs.\n\"For us technically, [it's] not as difficult as you imagine\u2026 actually it's just like Lego,\" says Mr Guan.\nIt has supplied factories, offices and an airport, and a hospital in Wuhan. \"It's running right now in the luggage hall\u2026 checking body temperature in the day, and it goes virus killing during the night,\" he says. However the robot's efficacy hasn't yet been evaluated.\nMeanwhile plant closures and other restrictions to curb coronavirus, have hampered getting parts. \"The lack of one single component, [and] we cannot build a thing,\" adds Mr Guan, though he notes things have improved in the last couple of weeks.\n\"There are not many good things to say about epidemics,\" says Professor Kolmus, but it has forced industry \"to find new solutions\".\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14DA8/production/_111361458_w-gbffgqs9cm55hsomsgqa_thumb_11f0.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51763394": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51763394", "title": "Singapore has moved all its hawkers indoors, and other big Asian cities are following suit", "published": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:01:00 GMT", "summary": "Singapore has moved all its street food vendors indoors. Could that be a model for other cities?", "story": "The mouth-watering food served up by South East Asia's street food vendors is a vital part of region's character and tourist appeal. So what happens if you make them pack up and move indoors?\nIn the tiny, two-metre square kitchen where Melvin works alongside his mother, there's barely space for both to stand between the boiling vats of braising gravy, the buckets of offal, bags of rice and a row of suspended duck carcasses.\nMelvin grew up watching his parents run the stall in Singapore, instilling in him a passion for hawker food.\n\"I love this job. I love being a hawker,\" he says, before admitting it's a \"very tough\" way of earning a living.\nThey don't take short cuts, so work starts early, shortly after 7am, collecting fresh ingredients, rolling up the rattling metal shutters, then laboriously washing out tubes of pig intestine and fatty strips of pork skin in plenty of cold water. Eggs must be parboiled, vegetables and tofu chopped, the meat cooked and portioned, sauces and garnishes prepared. \nBut somehow by lunchtime their stall is ready to churn out anything up to 200 portions a day of kway chap and braised duck, a dish originating from Guangdong in southern China, and rich in the flavours of orange peel, star anise, chilli and cinnamon.\nIn most Asian cities food hawkers line the streets, with pungent cooking aromas enticing passers-by. But Melvin's customers tuck into their meals under cover, on the second floor of a purpose-built shopping complex. They eat at formica-topped tables and cooking smells are sucked away by a humming extractor fan.\n\"Street food is no longer street-side food here in Singapore. It's a style of food that came from the street,\" says KF Seetoh, a culinary consultant and unofficial spokesperson for the city state's food hawkers.\nSingapore is a city built on migration. Waves of Indians, Chinese, Indonesians and others have flooded into the region's most prosperous city, joining the native Malays. But from the start, migrant workers craved familiar dishes from home.\n\"In the 1950s there were 22,000 itinerant vendors on the streets,\" says Mr Seetoh. \"Some people said get rid of them.\"\nInstead, he says, the authorities made \"a very practical decision\" - to bring them indoors.\nIt is an approach that has served Singapore well. The country is renowned for its rich variety of affordable food. Two of the city's hawkers have been awarded coveted Michelin stars. \nSeveral have created lucrative enterprises, a few have even expanded abroad. Singapore's government has applied for hawker culture to be recognised by Unesco for \"intangible cultural heritage\" status, alongside the likes of Belgium's beers and Turkish coffee houses.\nThat success, Mr Seetoh argues, is largely due to Singapore's decision to sanitise and regulate the sector.\n\"They said if you are going to eat it, it better be safe, because we don't know where these folks on the street got their supplies from. Did they wash their hands? Are they hygienic?\"\nFrom the 1960s onwards, vendors were installed in purpose-built hawker centres across the rapidly developing city state, provided with running water, electricity, grey water drainage and extraction hoods. \nAlong with the new facilities came regulations. Don't chop and prepare food on porous wood - surfaces must be stainless steel. Keep cooked and uncooked meat separate, and stored at precise temperatures. Wear gloves. Check the source of your ingredients. \nEach stall is given a hygiene rating.\n\"It is what we expect from this uber-efficient government,\" Mr Seetoh says. \"We call that peace of mind. Who doesn't want that?\nThe answer is plenty of others in the region. Malaysians scoffed when Singapore applied for Unesco heritage recognition,  arguing the city's food had lost its authenticity since coming off the streets.\nBangkok is now attempting to follow in Singapore's footsteps by bringing its own street food vendors into purpose-built centres in a bid to clear space on the pavements. However, the authorities are facing widespread opposition from those who say the character and appeal of Thailand's capital will be lost if its food hawkers are brought indoors.\nJorge Carillo, an anthropologist who studies South East Asia's street food sector, says moves like this are being encouraged by a preference amongst a new generation of customers in countries like Vietnam for higher hygiene standards and air-conditioned shopping centres. On top of that, costs are rising, while customers expect prices for street food to remain low. \nBut, above all, what is undermining the sector's prospects is the day-to-day reality of the job, he says.\n\"I have this issue with some people, because they keep pushing to keep street food because it gives the city character,\" says Mr Carillo. \"The reality is that selling street food is very hard work.\"\n\"What is changing is job opportunities are coming up, and people simply are stopping to do this very hard work\" he says. One woman hawker in Bangkok he interviewed starts shopping for ingredients at 3am, goes to her stall at 7am and then sells food for eight to 10 hours. \n\"If she gets another opportunity to do another job of course she's going to stop,\" he says.\nThe same is true in Singapore, as the first generation of hawkers, now in their 60s and 70s retires. It is proving difficult to persuade millennials, many of whom have degrees, and aspire to be entrepreneurs or work in Singapore's air-conditioned high-rises, to take up the baton. It's not what their parents want for them either.\nMelvin is an exception. \"Initially my mother was very against her children being hawkers because of the long hours,\" he says. \"She wanted me to work in an office.\" When his father passed away Melvin couldn't bear to think of the family business closing but they now take home only around 6,000 Singapore dollars (US$4,200; \u00a33,500) a month between them for a six-day working week.\n\"There are so many challenges, and these are very stacked up against the hawkers,\" says KF Seetoh. He adds that he's been \"shouting and crying about the impending demise of this food culture\" for some time - all because of this generational threat that no-one seems to know how to tackle. \nThere are bright spots of hope though - newcomers such as Michelle Yee Yuan and her husband Alan who gave up office jobs to open a stall not far from Melvin's. They serve a Korean-style ham cha, a mix of vegetables, peanuts, and rice combined with a bitter herb soup. \nThe ingredients are designed to appeal to health-conscious younger consumers, and they work hard to push their presence on social media, fighting for every customer.\n\"To get a new person to try our food is one of the challenges,\" says Michelle. She says it has been hard, working 12-14 hours a day sometimes, at the beginning she was so exhausted she fell ill a lot. She and Alan are taking home about half of their previous joint income.\nEverything, says Mr Seetoh, is stacked up against new entrants like Michelle and Alan. And yet Michelle says she loves the job, the environment and working alongside her husband all day.\n\"And I am working for my own creation,\" she says. \n You can listen to the accompanying radio programme on this topic from BBC World Service's \n. \nThe Food Chain\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51925465": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51925465", "title": "'It was never my plan to be the boss of a huge company'", "published": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 00:01:42 GMT", "summary": "Why Swiss drugs giant Novartis was prepared to take a chance on a young American.", "story": "When Vasant Narasimhan was told he was being considered for the top job at Swiss drugs giant Novartis, he thought there had been a mistake.\n\"It didn't seem plausible, at the time I was only 40,\" he says. \nVasant, a US citizen, had been with the Swiss firm for 12 years, and while he was global head of drug development, he was still a long way down the pecking order.\nYet in 2018, soon after turning 41, he became chief executive of the drugs giant, which had annual revenues of more than $50bn (\u00a341bn) that year and 125,000 employees around the world.\n\"I was shocked,\" says Vasant. \"At first I didn't really know what to make of it... it was never in my plan to become the CEO of a huge company.\n\"And then I felt exhilarated. Yes, it was scary as well but I was motivated to tackle this challenge. And then I dived right into thinking 'OK, what can we do with Novartis under new leadership?'.\"\nWhile you might think that putting someone relatively young in charge of a global firm is a bit unusual - Vasant's life story makes things become a lot clearer.\nBorn in Pittsburgh in 1976, to parents who had emigrated to the US from India, Vasant had the benefit of a pretty good scientific background - his dad was a chemist, and his mother was a nuclear scientist.\nAt school in Pittsburgh and then near Philadelphia, he says he was \"relatively shy and reserved, and very, very studious\".\n\"I think I was probably focused on trying to fit in as well,\" he says. \"At the schools I went to there weren't many other children of Indian origin, so I grew up always trying to figure out how to fit in.\"\nExcelling at sciences and maths, he then did a degree in biological sciences at Chicago University. He also did a course in philosophy, which would be a significant influence on his subsequent leadership style.\nAiming to be a doctor, his next move was to Boston's Harvard School of Medicine. And if that wasn't enough of a stretch on his time, he also enrolled on a parallel degree in public health policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. \n\"I didn't really do much drinking at college,\" he says. \"And I made do with just five or six hours sleep.\"\nThere was also no let up in his summer holidays, as he was always volunteering overseas; helping to fight malaria in Gambia, tackling tuberculosis in Peru and child poverty in India.\nAfter getting his doctorate in medicine from Harvard in 2003, Vasant says he thought of practicing medicine, but instead joined the World Health Organisation, where he spent a year working on its efforts to boost public health around the globe.\nHe then spent two years at management consultancy McKinsey, to boost his \"knowledge of the business world\", before joining Novartis.\nAs he rose through the ranks at the Swiss firm, one of his key roles was leading the firm's former vaccines division, which developed drugs to tackle influenza and meningitis. His work saw him appointed to the US National Academy of Medicine, the prestigious organisation for American healthcare leaders.\nWhile Novartis no longer has a vaccines business, Vasant - who was interviewed for this article on 10 Feb - says the industry is working as hard and as quickly as it can to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. \n\"It will take time though,\" he says. \"And then any vaccine will have to go through clinical trials before production. It will take time.\"\nWhen it comes to his leadership approach, Vasant leans on his student interest in philosophy. He says he is particularly influenced by two books: The classic 6th Century BC Chinese text, Tao Te Ching, and Daniel Pink's 2009 work, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.\nHe say that both have taught him that being a good leader is not about bossing people around but instead giving them more power - and making them happy.\n\"One thing we know about human motivation is that people feel their best when they have a sense of purpose and a sense of autonomy,\" he says.\nIn practical terms at Novartis, he says this means he has cut out unnecessary bureaucracy, and \"eliminated tens of thousands of approvals, which have pushed down decision-making across the organisation\". \n\"You would be surprised at how few emails I get these days,\" he adds. \"I get the emails that matter, but the rest are now tackled at the appropriate level.\"\nBarbara Obstoj-Cardwell, editor of The Pharma Letter, a website providing news and analysis on the pharmaceutical sector, says that Vasant has a \"charismatic presence\".\n\"Vas Narasimhan appears to have brought plenty of energy, dynamism and ambition since taking over at Novartis - and so far, the results have largely been impressive.\" \nBased at the firm's head office in Basel, there has never been a language barrier for Vasant, because the company switched from using German to English back in the 1990s.\nMarried with children, he says that staff quickly got over their surprise at someone so young being appointed to the top job. And back in the US, his parents were also pleased. \"They have stopped asking me when I'm going to finally become a doctor,\" he jokes.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p086vy76.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51659032": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51659032", "title": "How do you work out what something is worth?", "published": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 00:02:14 GMT", "summary": "Auctions have been around for centuries, but underpin the success of many internet giants today.", "story": "In the year 211BC, Rome and Carthage were engaged in a long war that was to shape the ancient Mediterranean. \nThe North African general Hannibal had vanquished Roman legions at will. As the Romans regrouped and began to fight back, Hannibal decided on a bold plan: he would march on Rome itself. \nAlthough he had little chance of breaching the city's defences, he hoped the Romans would panic and recall their armies. \nHannibal set up camp on the banks of the Anio, three miles from the city, but quickly learned that the land on which he had pitched his tent had been sold for a reasonable price via a public auction. Rome had seen through the bluff. \nIf the city rulers were willing to trade at full price the land underneath Hannibal's army, they did not expect his army to linger. It did not: Hannibal withdrew in short order.\nThis may be the only example of an auction being used as an attack on enemy morale, but it is not the first recorded auction. \nFor example, 300 years earlier, Herodotus describes men bidding for the most attractive wives in Babylon.\n\"The rich men who wanted wives bid against each other for the prettiest girls, while the humbler folk, who had no use for good looks in a wife, were actually paid to take the ugly ones.\"\nProblematic, yes - but ingenious. This auction was a community affair in which funds raised from the high bidders were used to compensate the poorer men.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\nAuctions seem to be almost as common as the marketplace itself. \nYou can imagine the idea being endlessly rediscovered around the world, whenever some trader offered to pay three obols per jar for a shipment of olive oil and the man next to him said: \"Don't take that offer - I'll pay four\". \nFrom such simple moments evolved the theatrical event we call the \"open outcry\" auction - a room full of art or antique dealers, millionaire backers submitting bids by phone, and a dapper auctioneer tickling the whole process along.\nGoing once, going twice... gone.\nBy making clear what others are prepared to pay, such auctions make it hard for the unscrupulous to exploit the gullible. \nIn the early 19th Century, British traders used auctions to offload large volumes of inexpensive British products in the United States. American consumers were delighted, but American merchants like Henry Niles were outraged.\n\"[Auctions are] the grand machine by which British agents at once destroy all regularity in the business of American merchants and manufacturers,\" he declared. \nAn anti-auction committee lobbied Congress, declaring: \"Auctions are a monopoly and like all monopolies are unjust, by giving to a few that which ought to be distributed among the mercantile community generally.\"\nThat was special pleading - the \"mercantile community\" just wanted to preserve its mark-ups. \nYet there is an important grain of truth in the complaint. In any auction, the sellers want to be where the buyers are and the buyers want to be where the sellers are. That makes auctioneering a natural monopoly - there is always a risk that large auction venues abuse their market power. \nWhile the open-outcry auction is the most famous kind, there are many other ways to design an auction. \nThe 17th-Century diarist Samuel Pepys describes an auction \"by an inch of candle\", which ended when the flame of the candle stub flickered out. The unpredictability of this moment was intended to prevent people from using the unpopular tactic of submitting a winning bid at the last second.\nIf not by candle, what about an auction by clock? \nThe \"Dutch clock auction\" is used at the vast flower market of Aalsmeer, with the clock face showing not the time, but the price. \nThat price ticks down and down, until somebody stops the clock by pressing a button. Whoever stopped the clock buys the flowers at the price specified. \nAt first glance, the method could hardly be more different from an open outcry auction. But in fact the fundamentals are not so very different - and they make the process even faster, as befits a product that will quickly wilt if it cannot be sold and shipped.\nThen there is the sealed-bid auction, beloved of estate agents: write down your bid, slip it into an envelope and seal it tight. Highest bid wins the prize. \nBut here's a curiosity: under the surface, the sealed-bid auction is exactly the same as the Dutch flower clock auction. \nIn each case, you simply need to pick your price. Unlike in an open outcry auction, you'll learn nothing about anybody else's willingness to pay until it's too late.\nThe Nobel laureate economist William Vickrey produced a famous theorem demonstrating that under ideal conditions, all auctions can be expected to raise the same amount of revenue.  \nLike any economic theorem that oversimplifies the case. \nAuction details can matter a lot - if an auction opens up a loophole for cheats, or discourages bidders from bothering, it can fail badly.\nOne might ask why auctions are used in some circumstances, while in other cases sellers post a take-it-or-leave-it price? Your local supermarket, for example, does not auction off the cabbages. \nThe answer is that auctions come into their own when nobody is quite sure of the value of what is being sold. \nSecond-hand products sold on eBay are an obvious example, but there are many others: a permit to drill for oil in unexplored terrain, a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, or a licence to use radio-spectrum to provide mobile phone services. \nThis common resource - the radio spectrum - used to be handed out to favoured companies for trivial sums. Now governments auction it off for billions. \nAnother example is the complex type of auction run by the US Forest Service for the right to conduct logging and remove timber. \nThese \"incredibly exciting\" auctions have been extensively analysed by Susan Athey, the first woman to win the prestigious Bates Clark Medal in economics. In particular, she and colleagues have explored the importance of the private information held by bidders in shaping the bids made and final prices paid. \nAfter all, in each of these cases, the true value of the item for sale is unknown. \nEach bidder makes use of their own information. The auction brings together all of that data, and transforms it into a price to be paid. It is quite a trick. \nAnd it is something the Romans understood when they reported the results of their auction to tell Hannibal that they were not scared.\nWhile auctions may seem reassuringly old-school, they take place at the cutting edge of the modern digital economy, and not just because of the success of internet auction sites like eBay and eBid.\nThink about what happens when you type a search term into Google. \nAlongside your search results, you'll see advertisements. Those adverts are there because they have won a complex and largely invisible auction. \nThis auction assigns them more or less prominent positions depending both on their maximum so-called \"cost-per-click bid\" - how much money a company has offered to pay Google for every person who clicks on its advert - and on how good the algorithm thinks the advert itself is.\nFor example, an art dealer might offer a high fee to appear next to searches for \"Picasso\", but an advertiser selling Picasso posters might expect many more clicks - and win top spot in the auction for a lower per-click bid.\nThese auctions take place every time someone types a search into Google, and their scale is unnerving. Google's parent company, Alphabet, makes more than $2bn (\u00a31.56bn) profit every month. Most of that is from advertising, and most of the advertising is sold by auction. \nIn 2019 Google was estimated to have taken more revenue from advertising than its two biggest rivals - Facebook and Alibaba - combined.\nOften you see an advert for Google's own products. Is it a problem that Google bids in its own auctions? \nIt is hard to be sure. You can imagine how any company might benefit from intimate knowledge of its rivals' strategies in bidding for ad space, though Google insists it gets no unfair advantage from its dominant market position.\nHenry Niles, the anti-auction activist, would no doubt have had something to say about that.\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D2F2/production/_111220045_976549r9htm6.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293675": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293675", "title": "Reducing brain damage in sport without losing the thrills", "published": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:27 GMT", "summary": "Sports like NFL and rugby are taking head injuries much more seriously and employing technology to help.", "story": "When Olympic gold medallist Shona McCallin was hit on the side of her head by a seemingly innocuous shoulder challenge, she suffered what was originally thought to be a concussion.\nHowever, headaches and other symptoms would not go away and brain scans revealed damage to her vestibular system - the part of the brain responsible for processing movement and motion.\nIt was seventeen months before she was able to play competitively again, but she made it back into the Great Britain hockey team.\n\"You know, unfortunately, injuries in sport and outside sport are a part of life,\" she says.\nFrom football to F1, professional sport has become more aware of the impact it has on the brains of athletes. \nThe US National Football League (NFL) has acknowledged that it concealed the dangers of concussion from players, leading to a settlement with ex-players that is expected to cost the NFL more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) over a 65-year period.\nBut damage to the brain is difficult to manage because it's difficult to measure.

The NFL can then simulate changes in the environment to see what would improve the safety of players.\nThe NFL makes the data available to firms that make helmets, and it says this has enabled improvements in one year that had previously taken a decade.\nIt has also launched a $3m helmet challenge for companies to design better helmets.\nThe platform could also be used in other sports such as soccer. \nThis is where companies like ANSYS are pitching for business. It provides simulation technology to check there are no design flaws when creating a helmet for sports. \n\"We can create a computer model of your brain. As the geometry of the brain is so complex, we are using medical imaging and transforming that into a 3D model,\" Thierry Marchal, global industry director at ANSYS, explains.\nThen the organisation can test and quantify the impact of certain actions, as well as validating these models with trained clinicians to ensure that the computer model represents and predicts accurately what's happening in a player's head. \n\"If there's some damage to a virtual player's head you can change a component such as the material to see if it will reduce the impact. Eventually we'll be able to have a helmet customised for specific athletes,\" he says.\nOther technologies are being used for rehabilitation. For example, McLaren Racing uses MindMaze technology inside the helmets of F1 racing drivers to provide more accurate neurological data to improve diagnosis and treatments of brain injuries. \nDespite the promise of these new technologies, Mr Sabin emphasises that there is still not a reliable imaging test that can either confirm a concussion, or tell the athlete whether they should stop playing their sport.\nHaving an extensive data set, such as the one NFL is putting together, could provide insight that hadn't been possible before, suggests Dr Willie Stewart. He is the consultant neuropathologist who led the study commissioned by the Football Association (FA) and the Professional Footballer's Association into the link between neurodegenerative diseases and ex-football players.\n\"We might consider something that hadn't been thought of before - it might be through using GPS tracking when players are accelerating, and how the brain functioning changes during that,\" he says. \nAlthough technology is advancing at pace, it will take time to use these to prevent and reduce concussions and impacts to the head in sport.\nIn the meantime, sports bodies are taking action. More Technology of Business, the FA, Scottish FA and Irish FA, advised that there should be no heading in training for primary school children, or under-11 teams and below.\nThere are also new rules for age ranges up until 18, with headers being kept a \"low priority\" and gradually becoming more frequent in training until the age of 16.\nWhile much worthy research and development is going on, sports are often operating under financial pressure.\nWill Carling, who captained England to three Grand Slams in the 1990s, says rugby union authorities are taking safety more seriously, but perhaps the biggest contribution to safety would be to play fewer games.\n\"I think sometimes we are still mistaking more games, for more money, for more profile, and we are abdicating a little bit of responsibility about player welfare.\n\"Exactly how much can the players at the very top of the game take? How much can their bodies and their minds actually sustain?\"\nProfessional athletes like Ms McCallin have to accept the risks of their sport.\n\"For me, the benefits of sport, both on a spiritual, mental and emotional capacity really do outweigh the potential risks of injury,\" she says.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6673/production/_110872262_shona.g.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851100": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851100", "title": "The Boss: Male investors didn't get my billion-dollar idea", "published": "Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:05:51 GMT", "summary": "How fashion boss Katrina Lake was able to succeed despite having to battle sexism.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Katrina Lake, founder of online fashion business Stitch Fix.\nFor the first six years running Stitch Fix, Katrina Lake wasn't comfortable with being labelled a female business leader.\n\"I didn't join the women in business clubs, and I just never thought of myself as a quote-unquote feminist,\" she says. \nBut taking her company public back in November 2017 led to a change of heart. The tech entrepreneur had her then 14-month-old son in her arms when she appeared at the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York for the firm's first day of trading.\nThe images went viral. Katrina, 34 at the time, become the youngest ever female founder to lead an initial public offering (IPO). She was widely hailed a role model for women, and mothers, in business.\n\"It felt like a really meaningful moment for me, and hopefully for others as well,\" she says. \"Showing examples of successful female CEOs is so important. So, I came around to being at a place where I really embraced it.\"  \nStitch Fix is an online personal shopping service that uses a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and human stylists to send customers fashion items that should be to their taste.\nUsers are sent clothes and accessories from a variety of brands selected especially for them based on their size, preferences and budget. They then keep and pay for what they want, and return what they don't.\nKatrina founded the company in 2011, aged 28, while studying for a Master of Business Administration degree at Harvard Business School, in Boston. Today her business is worth $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn), has 3.4 million customers, 6,600 employees, \nBut the path to this remarkable success wasn't smooth. Katrina's business was turned down by numerous potential investors, and she struggled to raise funds in the early days.\nShe also says that she wasn't taken seriously, simple because she was a woman. Meanwhile, a number of press reports in 2017 said that she had faced sexual harassment.\n\"There was so much adversity that I faced just because I was a woman,\" she says. \"What I realised through starting the company was that I'd thought of feminism as being a political thing, and this wasn't a political thing. This was about human rights and equality.\"\nRetaining a 16.6% share in Stitch Fix, Katrina's net worth stands at more than $200m. However, she didn't initially set out to become an entrepreneur.\nAfter growing up in Minnesota and San Francisco, she had wanted to follow in the footsteps of her father and become a doctor. Instead, after getting a degree in economics from Stanford University she started her working life as a management consultant, and later worked for an investment firm.\nHer passion was clothing retail though, and she hoped that being at an investment company would enable her to meet e-commerce founders, so that she could become part of the next big thing in the consumer fashion industry.\n\"I just wanted to work at whatever was going to be the future of apparel retail,\" she says. But she soon gained the confidence to go it alone. \"I realised there's nothing special about being an entrepreneur,\" she says. \nKatrina had the idea that people wanted a more personalized approach when it came to shopping for clothes, and that AI could help. At 5ft 2in (1.6m) tall, she says that she had always struggled to find clothes to suit her petite stature.\nHer sister, a fashion buyer, was also an inspiration. \"She was like a personal stylist to me sometimes... she knew all the up and coming brands,\" says Katrina.\nTo pursue her idea for Stitch Fix she enrolled at Harvard. While there she started to build the business from her student digs, along with her co-founder Erin Flynn. Flynn, a former buyer for US retailer J Crew, subsequently left the business in 2014.\n\"We cobbled together things you could do online for free,\" says Katrina. She would conduct online surveys to find out what potential customers wanted to buy.\nInitially targeting women, she would get prospective customers to enter information such as their size and the brands they liked. Then she'd buy clothes at boutiques with her credit card, and, with the help of friends and family, send them out.\n\"I would buy it at retail [prices] and sell it at [the same] retail [prices], so I wasn't making any money,\" says Katrina. \"But at least I could experiment to see if the concept worked.\"\nThe business quickly took off. \"It was 30 [employees], then 50 and then 120, and then it just grew organically from there.\" They managed to raise some capital, made some key tech hires to beef up the AI, and opened their headquarters in San Francisco. \nIn the early days, the business struggled to keep up with the pace of growth. \"We had a waiting list for a while,\" says Katrina.\nA big challenge was raising funds from the male-dominated investment community. \"I didn't have the trust of a lot of investors, and for me the biggest reason was around the lack of diversity in the venture capital world,\" she says.\n\"[Male] investors would say things like 'I can't see myself wanting something like this', and I'd be, 'Okay, well you're a Caucasian male who is very wealthy, and maybe this isn't the service that you would use.'\" \nThe business eventually attracted backers and Stitch Fix raised $42.5m, followed by a further $120m in the IPO. And it expanded to also sell men's and children's clothing.\nTamara Sender, senior fashion analyst at market research group Mintel, says Stitch Fix's success has been spurred by time-pressed consumers looking for a more bespoke approach.\n\"Stitch Fix's proposition responds to rising demand for a more personalised clothes shopping service, with growing interest among consumers in receiving lifestyle-based fashion recommendations,\" she says. \"It also draws on people's need for convenience.\"\nKatrina, whose mother was a Japanese immigrant, says she is focused on promoting diversity within her company, both women and people from ethnic minorities.\n\"I was brought up in a bilingual, bicultural household,\" says the 37-year-old, who lives in San Francisco with her husband, and two children.\n\"To be able to have broader representation in your team really just adds to the perspectives, ideas and global thinking you can have.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8FB0/production/_111248763_67d61986-82ad-4a9a-8cbb-383666f5308f.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851150": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851150", "title": "Mark Carney: What legacy will he leave the Bank of England?", "published": "Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:22:52 GMT", "summary": "The first non-British governor to lead the Bank in its 325-year history steps down this weekend.", "story": "Mark Carney steps down as Bank of England governor this weekend after almost seven years in the job.\nThe Canadian oversaw big changes at the Bank, which was given more power in the wake of the financial crisis.\nHe also led efforts to support the economy through Brexit and the coronavirus outbreak.\nMr Carney will leave the Bank more open and diverse than when he joined in July 2013, but his tenure has not been without controversy.\nHere are some of the changes that happened on his watch.\nThe world was very different in 2013. In the UK, economic growth was gaining traction, but unemployment was still high, at close to 8%.\nThis led to speculation about the timing of the first post-crisis interest rate rise.\nThe Bank believed the economic recovery needed more time to take hold.\nIt wanted to reassure people that borrowing costs would not rise any time soon, even if growth picked up.\nMr Carney had previously done this in Canada, which became the first G7 nation to raise interest rates after the global crisis.\nSo the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates tried something similar.\nIt said it wouldn't even start thinking about rate rises until unemployment fell to 7%.\nThe Bank also added some conditions that would overrule this \"forward guidance\". These included any signs of runaway inflation, or threats to financial stability.\nBut unemployment started falling much faster than the MPC had anticipated, quickly dipping below the 7% threshold.\nDavid Miles, a bank policymaker between 2009 and 2015, was in favour of the policy at the time. He now says the various caveats made forward guidance confusing.\nThe quick drop in unemployment raised speculation over interest rates. The Bank later changed its guidance to state that any rises would be \"limited and gradual\".\nMr Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College, London, said: \"The problem always was that any explicit and public rule to guide future policy would need to be complicated and contain many caveats if it was one that allowed the MPC to react to unexpected events.\n\"But that meant the guidance was of the form 'we will do X unless Y or Z were to happen in which case, then unless Q has happened, we will...'. I think in retrospect we got this wrong.\"\nMartin Weale, another former MPC member who voted against the policy, agrees: \"With hindsight, people found it much too complicated. I suppose they wanted a simpler story.\"\nMr Carney also came under fire for hinting at rate rises but not following through.\nMP Pat McFadden famously compared the Bank to an \"unreliable boyfriend\" for sending mixed messages to British households.\nMr Carney has stressed all guidance is based on an \"expectation not a promise\", with interest rate decisions always data dependent.\nMichael Saunders, who currently sits on the MPC, said forward guidance is very useful to people who don't follow interest rate movements closely.\n\"Giving general guidance on the direction of interest rates over the next quarter to few years is very useful, allowing [people] to make well-informed financial choices,\" he recently told MPs.\nThe vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 surprised investors, with the value of the pound plummeting against the dollar and euro.Mr Carney addressed the nation shortly after David Cameron resigned as prime minister in a bid to assure everyone that it was business as usual.\nHe said commercial banks would have enough cash, and worthy borrowers would have no problem getting loans. The Bank was well prepared and would take all necessary steps to ensure economic and financial stability.\nPolicymakers later cut interest rates to a fresh low of 0.25%, restarted its money printing programme and designed a new scheme to encourage lending in a world of low rates.\nHowever, some said Mr Carney's pre-Brexit interventions were too political.\nThe Governor warned ahead of the vote that it could tip the economy into recession.\nSeparate Bank analysis said choosing to leave the European Union would hit economic growth, stoke inflation and raise unemployment.\nMr Weale, a professor at King's college London, was involved in producing the Bank's pre-vote analysis.\nHe said: \"The Bank was obviously in a difficult position. On the one hand people wanted to know its views. On the other hand it risked being seen as partisan if it offered them.\"\nInterest rates were just 0.5% when Mark Carney joined the Bank of England. They're now even lower, at 0.25%.\nWith little room for rates to go lower still, the Bank's interest rate setters had to find new ways to support the economy.\nAs well as increasing the Bank's bond buying - or quantitative easing (QE) programme - policymakers started buying corporate debt in the wake of the Brexit vote.\nThey also created a new Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to support bank lending immediately after the referendum.\nIt offered cheap money - on the condition that commercial banks lent the cash to customers. This protected bank profit margins and got cash to worthy borrowers.\nUnder Mr Carney's leadership, the Bank also took steps to rein in borrowing without using interest rates.\nThe Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) took action in 2014 to prevent another housing bubble by imposing limits on the amount people can borrow to buy a home.\nMr Carney's transparency drive means interest rate setters now meet eight times a year instead of 12, and publish information about those meetings alongside decisions.\nThe reforms came after a review by former US central banker Kevin Warsh.\nWhile the changes have been widely welcomed, Mr Miles described a decision to publish transcripts of some of the MPC's conversations as \"wholly negative\".\nHe said the changes came after pressure from the Commons Treasury Select Committee.\n\"My observation was that it much reduced the usefulness of the decision meeting because most of the MPC members - and Mark Carney was an exception - decided they would simply read out pre-prepared statements of their view and their vote. Debate and open discussion dwindled.\"\nMr Weale said he also started reading pre-prepared statements and described his comments as more \"stilted\". \"I became more reluctant to revise what I was saying in light of what other people had said.\"\nTranscripts started being kept in 2015, and will be published with an eight year lag.\nThe governor has consistently highlighted the threat to the financial system from climate change.\nHe has warned that extreme weather events like hurricanes, heatwaves and floods pose significant risks to banks and insurers, which could end up suffering heavy losses.\nMr Carney and other global leaders have been trying to get companies to calculate their exposure to climate risks.\nIt's a drive he will continue in his new role as UN special envoy for climate action and finance.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9699/production/_111235583_carney.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676", "title": "Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?", "published": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:13:28 GMT", "summary": "Clever designs are trying to tackle queues for female loos, but will the innovations catch on?", "story": "A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group. \nBefore the show, they headed to the toilets. \"I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,\" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert. \nMeanwhile David took just \"two minutes\", and saw the whole show.\n\"I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'\"\nShe set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy.  \"I was not a designer. I was a user first,\" says the 46-year-old. \nDespite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, \"Up to now, nobody has cared\". \nHowever, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention. \n\"[It] forces them to offer better services,\" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.\nDes Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. \"It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.\"\nTwo units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries. \n\"The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,\" says the French entrepreneur.\nEven newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.\nCopenhagen-based architects, Gina P\u00e9rier and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.  \n\"It's just insanely more efficient,\" says Ms P\u00e9rier, 25.  \nThe idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival.  \"I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,\" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. \"There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.\"\nAccording to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate. \nThe team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.\nGetting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. \"We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,\" she tells me. \nLapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.\nMs P\u00e9rier says Lapee is also targeting, \"public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.\"\nThe start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year. \nThey're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.\nOther urinal products have launched with varying success.\nPerhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up. \nSam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.\n\"The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,\" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further. \nMr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.\nGail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.\n\"It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,\" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.\n\"Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.\"\nWomen typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned. \n\"We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,\" Ms Ramster says.\n\"Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.\"\nResearchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times. \nBut the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women. \n\"For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,\" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. \"This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].\" \nIt could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/183E2/production/_110689299_nathaliedesisnards-creditlavoixdunord.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51796812": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51796812", "title": "Coronavirus: Tourism in Thailand hit by Covid-19", "published": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:20:56 GMT", "summary": "Thailand's tourism industry, once considered very robust, is now struggling because of coronavirus.", "story": "Over the past 25 years, Thailand has experienced a spectacular economic crash (1997), a tsunami (2004), coups (2006, 2014), the occupation of its main international airport by protesters (2008) and serious political violence (2010).\nYet the statistics speak for themselves. In 1960 around 80,000 foreign tourists came here.\nLast year it reached 39 million, earning more than $60bn (\u00a346bn) for Thailand, and indirectly contributing around one fifth of the country's national income. \nThe country's tourism sector was considered so robust that the country got the nickname \"Teflon Thailand\". Yet of those 39 million tourists last year, more than 10 million were Chinese.\nSo when the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan on 23 January, and stopped all overseas tours, the impact was felt immediately in Thailand. Shopping malls and temples in Bangkok were suddenly much quieter and less crowded.\nAs more flights from China were cancelled, the airports emptied. You could whisk yourself through passport control in no time.\nFor small-scale entrepreneurs, the collapse of Chinese tourism has been disastrous. \nMany of them, such as flower sellers, traditional dancers, and the drivers of the famous \"red cars\" minibuses in Chiang Mai, are reporting their income dropping by half over the past month. The informal association representing tour guides in Thailand thinks 25,000 people are now out of work.\nOne of the first successes of Thailand's 60-year-long tourist boom was the island of Phuket, nicknamed the \"Pearl of the Andaman\" for its soft white-sand beaches and sparkling warm seas. \nThe first foreign visitors in the 1980s and 1990s were mainly European and Australian, but the number of Chinese visitors last year shot up to about two million out of the 15 million foreigners.\nThe mangrove-lined inlets on the east side of the island, a contrast to the beaches facing the west, are where the boats leave from to take tourists out to the islands offshore. Like many of Phuket's residents, Nattakit Lorwitworrawat moved here from his home town elsewhere in Thailand to start a business.\nHis company now owns 30 speed boats, each able to carry 30 people. He has had to take 20 out of the water, and the remaining 10 are not getting much use. The inlet, normally constantly noisy from the sound of outboard motors, is now silent apart from the birds and the lapping water.\n\"At the peak two years ago we carried 1,000 clients a day. Today if we get 200 clients, that is considered very good - we would be very happy with that,\" says Nattakit.\nHe has bank loans to service on many of his boats. If the crisis goes on beyond the end of this year, he says he will have to downsize the company and start laying off his staff.\nFor those lower down the food chain it is even tougher. \nSomkiat Prasarn has a mortgage on his little house, and loans on the van and car he bought to take Chinese tourists out on day trips around the island. He is supporting four children and an elderly mother.\nHis monthly payments on the loans, he said, are around $1,500 a month. Could he hold out for six months, I asked him? \"I cannot, sir,\" he says. Right now he is getting no custom at all apart from the occasional airport pickup.\n\"The government needs to help us and soon,\" says Sarayuth Mallam, vice-president of the Phuket Tourism Association. \"We don't ask for much. But if they want us not to lay off staff, they have to help us by cutting or delaying tax payments, social security payments, and giving soft loans to businesses here.\"\nSarayuth also believes the powerful Tourism Authority of Thailand needs to start promoting Phuket aggressively in other markets outside China, like Russia, India and Australia. If they can control the virus in three months, he says, we can survive and come back.\nBut nobody knows how long this crisis will last, nor how serious it will become. For the moment there are still plenty of Europeans, Australians and Russians on the famous beaches, but for how long?\nThe authorities here have managed to control and monitor infections well considering how vulnerable it was from the number of Chinese people visiting before the restrictions on travel were implemented.\nYet the country has already been placed on some government lists of places to avoid because of coronavirus risk. \nAnd people are booking holidays for later in the year, including the traditional high seasons of July-August and December-New Year in Thailand. \nFamilies with children from Europe or Australia are likely to think twice before travelling so far. And Thailand is now imposing its own restrictions, requiring 14-day quarantine for visitors from some countries, a list that may well expand.\nWho will risk booking a holiday in the sun if they end up spending it confined to their hotel room or a hospital? \nWith more flights being cancelled every week, the numbers of non-Chinese tourists are bound to fall steeply this year, however quickly the virus is brought under control.\nThe blow to this essential leg of Thailand's economy has come at a terrible time for the government. Already the other two main legs of the economy - manufacturing exports and agricultural commodities - are wobbling as higher wages and an overvalued local currency have been driving investors to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam. \nGrowth in what was once one of South East Asia's \"tiger economies\" has been anaemic for several years, and may stall completely this year. The government, an unwieldy coalition controversially built around the same military leaders who led the last coup, is proving clumsy and unpopular.\nIt is an almost perfect storm, one that Thailand's present leaders look ill-equipped to weather.\nMore from the \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/88CD/production/_111212053_beachphuket-2020099.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50987803": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50987803", "title": "Does being 'TikTok famous' actually make you money?", "published": "Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:29:08 GMT", "summary": "Social media app TikTok has created a host of young stars in the UK, but can they make money from the medium?", "story": "When I meet up with Jake Sweet (aka Surfaceldn on TikTok), he's buzzing. \nHe's about to be flown out to the MTV Video Music Awards in Spain as a special guest.

The international version of the app has more than one billion users. In 2019 it was the second-most downloaded app globally, after WhatsApp.\nThe platform is owned by ByteDance and morphed out of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly. Music remains an important part of the experience - posts can be set to snippets of the latest commercial releases.\nWhat sets TikTok apart from other social media platforms is the way it finds videos for you. As well as seeing videos posted by friends, users are recommended videos by the company's software algorithm.\nUnlike Facebook, which recommends content based on your friends' activity, TikTok delves deep into users' behaviour on the app to figure out their tastes. Make the right kind of content and you can potentially reach millions of eyeballs.\nAnd this explains a big reason for TikTok's appeal. In theory anyone can become \"TikTok famous\" - you don't have be a reality-TV star, or celebrity sportsperson to make viral videos. \nAdd to the equation the app's hashtag challenges and the experience becomes like a talent show.\nOn established platforms like YouTube and Instagram, influencers have made millions through advertising revenue and paid promotions. So can everyday influencers who crack the TikTok code make money, considering its vast reach?\nJake earns a small but steady income from TikTok which helps him at university - it's enough for things like groceries. But most of the money he makes gets spent on props for his next videos, he says.\nDoing several videos a day is time-consuming - even his 15-second videos can take up to an hour to record. He has to put in an \"extra shift\" to make sure his university studies don't suffer.\nBut he gets lifestyle perks like party invites, and the experience of being a social media celebrity.\n\"I do get some money through promotions,\" he explains. \"I've done work with people like Amazon Music, rappers Trippie Redd and Juice Wrld.\"  \n\"They say we need you to promote this song, by doing a video along these lines, and then I put my own creative interpretation into it.\"\nJake gets his paid work through a company called Fanbytes, one of the digital agencies which have sprung up to service influencers. \nWell-known early agencies of this kind include OP Talent, set up in 2012, which signed gaming star KSI, and Gleam Futures, which snapped up YouTuber Zoe Sugg.\nTimothy Armoo founded Fanbytes in 2017 with fellow computer scientists he met at university.\nThe company is busy signing up Snapchat and TikTok users, with a focus on \"Gen Z\" and the 18-21 market.  It uses in-house algorithms to predict whose followings are about to take off. \nIts software also measures who can persuade their followers to click on links - this is known as \"conversion ability\".\nAfter that, some old-fashioned human decision making comes into play.\n\"We want people who can deliver what we call 'advertainment'\", explains Armoo. This is a seamless mixture of fun and paid-for content, while maintaining what he describes as a \"boy- or girl-next-door quality\".\nArmoo has hooked influencers up with brands like Deliveroo, but also the government, who wanted his help to spread the word about the national minimum wage to a BAME audience. \nInfluencers can generate an annual income close to \u00a320-25,000 ($26-$32,000) if they build a following of more than two million on TikTok, Armoo reckons, from paid content, appearances and merchandising.\nNow meet Shauni Kibby (aka @itzshauni).\nShauni gets recognised by young teenagers in the street all the time thanks to her work on TikTok, where she has 3.2 million followers.\nShe joined the app's predecessor, Musical.ly in 2016. Within five days her videos were getting 10,000 likes and she immediately saw the potential, she says.\nYou can see why her videos appeal to a young audience. Many are like playground games and include fun pranks, tricks to impress friends, dances, or skits about love and relationships.\nTikTok now provides her with enough money to live on, plus the ability to indulge her habit of clothes shopping - but less than you might think, given the size of her fanbase. \nSara McCorquodale, who runs an influencer intelligence platform called CORQ which tracks TikTok trends, agrees the platform is a tricky financial proposition.\nWhile she predicts that brands will be spending more money on it this year, the model for rewarding influencers will have to be different to YouTube or Instagram, because \"short-term trends dominate what is popular as much as individual personalities\". \n\"It's like the internet before Facebook, it's fast-moving and unpredictable.\" \nTikTok is busy moving into the mainstream with an advertising campaign, and expanding its community management operation in London. It will have to manage its influencers' money-making activities more carefully as it gets more attention.\n\"If you make sponsored content you have to do it explicitly and if the brand or influencer doesn't, they can get sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),\" says Ms McCorquodale. \"Even if you are wearing a piece of clothing that is a gift, that has to be made clear.\"\nNot all influencers on TikTok are following these rules at the moment, and Instagram influencers have recently been banned for being irresponsible and for not being up front about product promotion.  \nTikTok says that \"every video posted as an advertisement is reviewed by us to ensure it is compliant with the ASA guidelines\".\nIt also says it regularly shares the ASA guidelines with creators, and that if an influencer indicates a video is sponsored, it will automatically be posted with \"#ad\" displayed.\nTikTok has fallen foul of influencer behaviour before. Last year it was forced to apologise for the way some stars exploited young fans for financial gain through \"digital gifts\", with influencers themselves calling for more guidance from the app. \nTikTok's growing prominence has also seen it face closer scrutiny over issues that affect all social media platforms like user privacy and personal safety. \nIt was fined in the United States for holding data on children under 13 and more recently faced criticism for the meme known as the skull-breaker challenge.\nCharities have also called for it to do more to prevent the grooming of young children.\nJake plans to complete his degree and then pursue a full-time career as a social media influencer, focusing on TikTok. \n\"I want this to be an occupation for me,\" he says. Meanwhile, he is simply enjoying the interesting opportunities it brings.\nThe student's next engagement is a party to celebrate the launch of a new shoe, which he will of course be TikToking about.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/133B0/production/_110386787_img_7410.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51814826": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51814826", "title": "'That was the worst day of my business life'", "published": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:05:52 GMT", "summary": "How coffee company Equator managed to survive and grow after a major threat to its business.", "story": "Eight years ago, Helen Russell and her wife Brooke McDonnell received some bad news that threatened the future of their business Equator Coffees.\nStarbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, had announced that it was acquiring Equator's biggest customer, a bakery chain called La Boulange.\n\"That was the worst day of my business life,\" recalls Helen.\nAt the time, San Francisco Bay Area-based Equator was a small wholesale coffee roaster. Losing La Boulange meant that more than $1m (\u00a3770,000) of orders were cancelled overnight. The company's survival was at stake.\n\"I got a call directly from the owner of La Boulange about the sale,\" says Helen.  \"We had been partners for years, I personally installed the brewer in his original bakery. We had grown together.\n\"At that time La Boulange [then 20 stores in and around San Francisco Bay] was by far our largest customer. My biggest concern was for the people who relied on Equator for their livelihoods.\n\"I didn't see how we could lose that much business and not lay people off at our roastery and default on coffee contracts with our farmer partners.\"\nBut determined to save their business, and the jobs of their employees, Helen and Brooke decided to re-invent Equator by opening their first retail outlets, across San Francisco and beyond.\n\"We turned our focus to opening our first retail cafe, and actually closed the revenue gap created by losing La Boulange,\" says Helen.\n\"It was the first year of business where we didn't show sales growth, but we actually added about a million dollars of new business that year!\"\nToday, Equator has grown to 155 employees across eight retail stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, with three new branches opening in 2020. It also supplies coffee to consumers across the US via its website, and to 460 business customers countrywide via its wholesale arm.\nHelen, who has the chief executive title, and Brooke, who is president, could only have dreamt of such success when they launched the business 25 years ago. The idea for Equator came one day when they were taking a coffee break from their job at the time - buying and selling houses.\n\"I was having a mocha with whipped cream,\" says Helen, \"and Brooke was telling me about the viscosity and flavour notes of her espresso.\n\"And I said, 'Oh my God, you love coffee, I love business. We're in our early 30s - we should start something together.'\"\nThey wrote a business plan on the back of a napkin that afternoon, and began their journey by acquiring and operating two coffee carts.\nThey initially bought in beans that had already been roasted, but Helen says that they very quickly became frustrated with their suppliers.\n\"We were shocked by the lack of information we would receive from our roaster partners,\" she says. \"No one would share what was in the blends, let alone what they were paying to their farmer partners.\"\nThis did not sit well with the couple, so they decided to sell the carts and buy a small roaster instead. They set this up in their garage.\n\"We knew then that we wanted a different type of coffee company,\" says Helen. \"One that focused on transparency and sustainability.\n\"We were the first roastery in California to offer Fair Trade certified coffee, and we continue to pay above fair trade minimum prices to our producers.\"\nHelen and Brooke were also female pioneers. \"When we started in 1995, there were only five women [including us] roasting coffee in the US.\"\nToday Equator has a number of high profile business customers, including the restaurants of top US chefs Thomas Keller and Dominique Crenn, and the cafes and coffee bars at the headquarters of Twitter, Google and LinkedIn.\nHelen says that opening its own stores helped Equator to secure such high-profile customers because its bricks-and-mortar outlets \"helped us build our brand and our reputation\".\nBut building a viable coffee business to compete against the industry giants was never going to be an easy task. Helen's strategy was simple - offer what the big players couldn't, because they would always be able to sell coffee for a price that would be too low for Equator to beat.\n\"We had to be unique,\" she says. \"We had excellent tasting coffee, talked about where the coffee came from, and offered a level of service the big guys couldn't.\n\"Our customers responded to that. Had we simply tried to be a local version of a big company, without a unique selling proposition, we would not have been able to compete.\" \nEquator is also unusual in the coffee shop sector in that all its staff have access to health insurance. \"Sure, it's expensive, but health insurance should be a right of all Americans,\" says Helen.\n\"Any CEO who has a private plane, and also people who work for them who are uninsured, is running their business wrong.\"\nCoffee expert Willem Boot, is the founder of Boot Coffee, a company that trains people to work in the industry. He says that Equator stands out against its competitors because of the quality of its staff.\n\"It all comes back to the people that work for them - coffee-dedicated and socially-minded, kind human beings. These qualities define the essence of the Equator coffee experience.\"\nProudly owned by a lesbian couple, Equator is particularly popular with members of the LGBTQ community. \"Simply by Brooke and I being out, along with Maureen our first employee and current executive vice president, people from the LGBTQ community know they can come to us and feel protected, valued and appreciated,\" says Helen.\n\"We are bigger now than I ever imagined we would be, and I still feel like we are just getting started,\" she says. \"We have so many options because we've made the right decisions for us and kept our focus on using business as a force for good.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p0866zcq.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52028108": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52028108", "title": "Coronavirus: The struggle of being a ride-share driver", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 14:37:43 GMT", "summary": "Julie Davis is a ride-share driver in the virus hotspot of Seattle - watch her emotional video diary.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/14CD2/production/_111420258_p087mrv8.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52009076": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52009076", "title": "Remote working: Seven tips for successful video meetings", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:51:23 GMT", "summary": "Workplace consultant Guenaelle Watson gives seven tips for better video meetings.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/CBDD/production/_111398125_p087dgv3.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52006907": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52006907", "title": "The Prodrive Motorsport company it switching its factory to ventilators", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 14:05:53 GMT", "summary": "The Prodrive Motorsport company it switching its factory to ventilators", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/208x117/p087f6j9.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52008198": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52008198", "title": "Coronavirus: Inside a community pharmacy under pressure", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 09:20:13 GMT", "summary": "Pharmacists are asking people not to stockpile drugs as many report a threefold increase in footfall.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/5226/production/_111403012_p087hb5f.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52019803": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52019803", "title": "Coronavirus: Barclay on government help for self-employed", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 13:23:51 GMT", "summary": "The government says self-employed people have not been forgotten when it comes to financial help.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/0B22/production/_111405820_p087j31j.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51982523": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51982523", "title": "UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak: UK govt to 'help to pay people's wages'", "published": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:15:56 GMT", "summary": "The chancellor said the measures were being put in place \"for the first time in our history\".", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/EB11/production/_111377106_p0876l4z.jpg"}}, "science": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52048195": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52048195", "title": "Coronavirus: Pangolins found to carry related strains", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:56:53 GMT", "summary": "Smuggled pangolins were carrying viruses closely related to the one sweeping the world, say scientists.", "story": "Smuggled pangolins have been found to carry viruses closely related to the one sweeping the world.\nScientists say the sale of the animals in wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to minimise the risk of future outbreaks.\nPangolins are the most-commonly illegally trafficked mammal, used both as food and in traditional medicine.\nIn research published in the journal Nature, researchers say handling these animals requires \"caution\".\nAnd they say further surveillance of wild pangolins is needed to understand their role in the risk of future transmission to humans. \nLead researcher Dr Tommy Lam of The University of Hong Kong said two groups of coronaviruses related to the virus behind the human pandemic have been identified in Malayan pangolins smuggled into China. \n\"Although their role as the intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remains to be confirmed, sale of these wild animals in wet markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future zoonotic [animal to human] transmission,\" he told BBC News.\nExactly how the virus jumped from a wild animal, presumably a bat, to another animal and then humans remains a mystery. The horseshoe bat and the pangolin have both been implicated, but the precise sequence of events is unknown.\nFinding the virus in smuggled Malayan pangolins raised the question of where they contracted the virus, said Dr Lam. Was it from bats along the trafficking route to China or in their native habitats in Southeast Asia? \nConservationists say it would be devastating if the discovery led to further persecution of the endangered mammal. The animal's scales are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy.\n\"This is the time for the international community to pressure their governments to end illegal wildlife trade,\" said Elisa Panjang of Cardiff University, a pangolin conservation officer at the Danau Girang Field Centre in Malaysia. \nChina has moved to ban the consumption of meat from wild animals in the wake of the outbreak. Similar moves are being considered in Vietnam. \nProf Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said it was important not to jump to conclusions from the paper.  \"The source of the detected coronavirus really is unknown - it might have been a natural pangolin virus or have jumped from another species between capture and death.\"\nAnd Dr Dan Challender, of the University of Oxford, said pangolins are known to host various strains of coronaviruses. \"Identifying the source of SARS-CoV-2 is important to understand the emergence of the current pandemic, and in preventing similar events in the future,\" he said.\nFollow Helen \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/171F7/production/_110911749_gettyimages-51341736.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52040822": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52040822", "title": "Help needed to rescue UK's old rainfall records", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 02:10:31 GMT", "summary": "Pre-1960s handwritten rain gauge data can inform drought and flood planning, but only if digitised.", "story": "At a loss to know what to do with your self-isolation time?\nWell, why not get on the computer and help with a giant weather digitisation effort? \nThe UK has rainfall records dating back 200 years or so, but the vast majority of these are in handwritten form and can't easily be used to analyse past periods of flooding and drought. The Rainfall Rescue Project is seeking volunteers to transfer all the data into online spreadsheets.\nYou're not required to rummage through old bound volumes; the Met Office has already scanned the necessary documents - all 65,000 sheets.\nYou simply have to visit a website, read the scribbled rainfall amounts and enter the numbers into a series of boxes.\n\"If you do just a couple of minutes every now and then - that's great,\" said Prof Ed Hawkins. \"If you want to spend an hour doing 30 or 40 columns - then that'll be amazing.

Something like three to five million data points in all.\nBut if Prof Hawkins' team can convert this information into a computer-friendly format, it could lead to a much better understanding of the frequency and scale of big droughts and floods. And that will assist with planning for future flood and water-resource infrastructure.\nFor example, many across the country had a sodden start to the year because of heavy rainfall. But meteorologists suspect the October of 1903 was just as bad, if not worse. Unfortunately, because all the rainfall data from the time was noted down on paper, it's not possible to be precise.\nLikewise, there were some very dry springs and winters in the 1880s and 1890s. Britain had six or seven very dry winters and springs on the trot. \nIf that happened today, it would probably cause quite serious problems for the water companies because they rely on wet winters and wet springs to recharge the reservoirs.\n\"Water companies have to plan for a one-in-100 or one-in-500-year drought,\" said Prof Hawkins. \"But we've only got 60 years of very dense digital data, and so it's very hard for them to come up with reliable estimates. \n\"We know there are periods in the past that, if they happened again, would probably break the system.

However, in one location where winters were particularly severe, the males lived much shorter lives. \n\"Male bighorn sheep use lots of resources towards sexual competition, towards the growth of a large body mass, and they might be more sensitive to environmental conditions,\" said Dr Lema\u00eetre.  \n\"So clearly the magnitude of the difference in lifespan is due to the interaction of these sex-specific genetics, the fact that males devote more resources towards specific functions compared with females, and to the local environmental conditions.\" \nEven if females lived longer than males, the team found that it did not mean that the risks of dying are increasing more in males than females as they get older. The expected male mortality is always higher, but the rate of mortality is about the same in both sexes as they age.\nOne recent \n suggested that the genetic differences between males and females were key. \nIn humans, our cells contain different chromosomes, depending on sex. Females have two X chromosomes while males have an X and a Y. The theory is that the extra X in women has a protective effect against harmful mutations and that this holds true in other species.\nThe author of the new study on mammals says that both pieces of research are complementary.\n\"They show that in XX or XY systems, the XX, or the female, lives longer, so clearly there is an effect of sex chromosomes,\" said Dr Lema\u00eetre. \n\"What we show in our paper is that the difference is very variable across species, meaning there are other factors that need to be considered to explain this variability.\"\nThe \nin Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nstudy in this field\nstudy has been published \n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52007637": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52007637", "title": "Climate change: Earth's deepest ice canyon vulnerable to melting", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 16:16:54 GMT", "summary": "Nasa scientists probe Denman Glacier which fills the deepest land gorge on Earth.", "story": "East Antarctic's Denman Canyon is the deepest land gorge on Earth, reaching 3,500m below sea-level. \nIt's also filled top to bottom with ice, which US space agency (Nasa) scientists reveal in a new report has a significant vulnerability to melting. \nRetreating and thinning sections of the glacier suggest it is being eroded by encroaching warm ocean water.\nDenman is one to watch for the future. If its ice were hollowed out, it would raise the global sea surface by 1.5m.\n\"How fast this can happen? Hard to say, since there are many factors coming into play, for example the narrowness of the channel along which Denman is retreating may slow down the retreat,\" explained Dr Virginia Brancato, from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a former scholar at the University of California at Irvine (UCI).\n\"At present, it is critical to collect more data, and closely and more frequently monitor the future evolution of the glacier,\" she told BBC News. \nMost people recognise the shores around the Dead Sea in the Middle East to have the lowest visible land surface elevation on Earth, at some 430m below sea level. But the base of the gorge occupied by Denman Glacier on the edge of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) actually reaches eight times as deep. This was only recently established, and it has made Denman a location of renewed scientific interest.\nDr Brancato and colleagues used satellite radar data from 1996 to 2018 to show there's been a marked retreat in the glacier's grounding line. This is the point where the ice stream lifts up and floats as it flows off the land and enters the ocean. \nThe line has reversed 5-6km in 22 years. \nWhat's interesting about this reversal, however, is that it's asymmetric; it's occurring pretty much all on the western side of the glacier. \nThe reason, the scientists can now determine, is a buried ridge under the eastern flank which is pinning and protecting that side of the glacier. In contrast, the western flank features a narrow but sizeable trough that would allow warm ocean water to erode the grounding line and push it backwards. \nThis potentially is an Achilles heel. The further inland the glacier reaches, the deeper its bed - which is a geometry that has been demonstrated to favour more and more melting. If a lot of warm ocean water can find its way to the front of Denman, the opportunity is there to melt out its ice in a significant way.\nMost of the ice loss in Antarctica is occurring in the west of the continent. Glaciers in East Antarctica have generally been thought of as stable, as being quiescent. It's only a relatively few ice streams that have been marked out for special attention. Key among these is Totten Glacier, a colossus that is thinning at a rate of about half a metre a year. But Nasa and UCI researcher Prof Eric Rignot believes Denman is probably the more vulnerable of the two right now. He told BBC News: \"I think in terms of the geometry, Denman is more of an Achilles heel than Totten, because it has this deep trough with a retrograde slope that is sort of a perfect crime in the making - as opposed to Totten which has 50km on a prograde slope, of a bed going uphill, before you get into the very deep stuff.\" \nWhat's lacking currently is better information about the movement of warm water coming from the deep ocean. For the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), it has been shown there are clear paths for it to get up on to the continental shelf and attack glaciers. \nFor Denman, this is really a supposition at present - the simplest, best way to explain the observations.\nThere is some insightful data from instruments mounted on seals that have dived in the area. The marine mammals' information points to routes warm water could take, but the investigations need to be much more extensive.\nDr Emma Smith, recently of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, commented: \"We need to make more observations beneath the ice shelves and margins of East Antarctica. \n\"The glaciology community assumed for some time the EAIS was relatively stable compared to WAIS and didn\u2019t worry about it too much. Now that view is slowly shifting as we start to see the vulnerability of certain areas of the EAIS and understand more about the ice-ocean interactions in these areas.\"\nThe Nasa-UCI-led team\u2019s assessment of Denman Glacier is published in the American Geophysical Union journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3C6D/production/_111396451_whatsubject.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-51975351": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-51975351", "title": "Machine 'could quadruple' heart and lung transplants", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 01:10:34 GMT", "summary": "The device managed to pump oxygenated blood into both organs in a world-first procedure.", "story": "The number of heart and lung transplants could quadruple thanks to a \"reanimation\" machine used in a pioneering operation, a hospital says.\nThe device, developed at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, managed to pump oxygenated blood into both organs in a world-first procedure. \nThe machine can revitalise deteriorating organs allowing \"donation after circulatory death\" (DCD).\nHospital surgeon Pedro Catarino said it was like \"recharging the batteries\".\n\"It is reanimation and then it replenishes the energy stores of the heart, what we call reconditioning, which allows it be transplanted,\" he said.\n\"We think it could at least double and perhaps quadruple the number of [heart and lungs] available for transplant.\"\nHe said it was desperately needed, adding: \"Patients die on the waiting list every day.\"\nMost organs come from people who are brain dead.

It\u2019s the size of Blackpool. \nIt nurtures star attractions like rare sand lizards; Dartford warblers, silver-studded blue butterflies; nightjars; smooth snakes; and woodlarks.\nAt the heart of the reserve are two large tracts of mostly forested ground owned by Forestry England and the Rempstone Estate. They\u2019ve both agreed to co-operate with the nature plan.\nMuch of the forest will be removed and the land will be restored to wet heath, which is highly effective at trapping carbon in the soil. \nOther partners are Natural England; Forestry England; Dorset Wildlife Trust and Amphibian and Reptile Conservation and the National Trust.\nAngela Cott, the National Trust\u2019s manager on Brownsea island in Poole Harbour, told BBC News the new reserve is the latest initiative in a long drive to return local farmland to nature.\n\u201cBrownsea Island was lowland heath since prehistoric times, but the Victorians worked hard to convert it into farmland and forestry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in it for managing nature now.

Emissions of carbon monoxide, mainly due to cars and trucks, have fallen by around 50% for a couple of days this week according to researchers at Columbia University.\nThey have also found that there was a 5-10% drop in CO2 over New York and a solid drop in methane as well. \n\"New York has had exceptionally high carbon monoxide numbers for the last year and a half,\" said Prof R\u00f3is\u00edn Commane, from Columbia University, who carried out the New York air monitoring work.\n\"And this is the cleanest I have ever seen it. It's is less than half of what we normally see in March.\"\nAlthough there are a number of caveats to these findings, they echo the environmental impacts connected to the virus outbreaks in China and in Italy.\nAn analysis carried out for the climate website Carbon Brief suggested there had been a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period. This is likely to lead to an overall fall of about 1% in China's carbon emissions this year, experts believe. \nBoth China and Northern Italy have also recorded significant falls in nitrogen dioxide, which is related to reduced car journeys and industrial activity. The gas is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet.\nWith aviation grinding to a halt and millions of people working from home, a range of emissions across many countries are likely following the same downward path. \nWhile people working from home will likely increase the use of home heating and electricity, the curbing of commuting and the general slowdown in economies will likely have an impact on overall emissions. \n\"I expect we will have the smallest increase in May to May peak CO2 that we've had in the northern hemisphere since 2009, or even before,\" said Prof Commane.\nThis view is echoed by others in the field, who believe that the shutdown will impact CO2 levels for the whole of this year. \n\"It will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and how widespread the slowdown is in the economy particularly in the US. But most likely I think we will see something in the global emissions this year,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia.\n\"If it lasts another three of four months, certainly we could see some reduction.\" \nWhat's likely to make a major difference to the scale of carbon emissions and air pollution is how governments decide to re-stimulate their economies once the pandemic eases. \nBack in the 2008-09, after the global financial crash, carbon emissions shot up by 5% as a result of stimulus spending that boosted fossil fuel use. \nIn the coming months, governments will have a chance to alter that outcome. They could insist, for instance, that any bailout of airlines would be tied to far more stringent reductions in aviation emissions.\n\"Governments now have to be really cautious on how they re-stimulate their economies, mindful of not locking in fossil fuels again,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\"They should focus those things that are ready to go that would lower emissions, like renovating buildings, putting in heat pumps and electric chargers. These are not complicated and can be done straight away, they are just waiting for financial incentives.\" \nHowever, some argue that if the pandemic goes on a long time, any stimulus would more likely focus on promoting any economic growth regardless of the impact on the environment. \n\"I certainly think climate could go on the back burner, and in this case, I don't think there is much hope that stimulus goes to clean energy,\" said Prof Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research.\n\"Any stimulus will help those with job losses such as tourism and services. I think this is very different to the global financial crisis. The only silver linings could be to learning new practices to work remotely, and buying a few years of lower growth allowing solar and wind to catch up a bit, though, these may be rather small silver linings.\" \nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/609E/production/_111343742_gettyimages-1207568654.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51977625": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51977625", "title": "Electric car emissions myth 'busted'", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 16:00:05 GMT", "summary": "Fears that electric cars could actually increase carbon emissions are a baseless, a study suggests.", "story": "Fears that electric cars could actually increase carbon emissions are a damaging myth, new research shows.\nMedia reports have questioned if electric cars are really \u201cgreener\u201d once emissions from manufacture and electricity generation are counted.\nThe research concludes that in most places electric cars produce fewer emissions overall - even if generation still involves fossil fuels.\nOther studies warn that driving overall must be reduced to hit climate targets.\nThe new research from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen - in The Netherlands - and Cambridge shows that in 95% of the world, driving an electric car is better for the climate than a petrol car.\nThe only exceptions are places like Poland, where electricity generation is still mostly based on coal.\nThe researchers say average \u201clifetime\u201c emissions from electric cars are up to 70% lower than petrol cars in countries like Sweden and France (where most electricity comes from renewables and nuclear), and around 30% lower in the UK.\nThey say the picture for electric cars will become steadily more favourable as nations shift to clean electricity.\nThe study projects that in 2050 every second car on the streets of the world could be electric.

First, it\u2019ll be hard to shift the car fleet to electric in time to meet the UK\u2019s 2050 climate goal.\nSecond, the process will put a huge strain on the generation and supply of clean energy.\nAnd third, abrasion of electric car tyres and brakes will still create pollution in cities.\nProf Greg Marsden, from the Institute for Transport Studies at Leeds University, warned: \u201cElectrification is necessary but not enough. \n\u201cTravel demand reductions of at least 20% are required, along with a major shift away from the car if we are to meet our climate goals.\n\u201cThis implies a really major social change. That is why it is a climate emergency and not a climate inconvenience.\u201d\nThe new study also looked at electric household heat pumps and found they, too, produce lower emissions than fossil-fuel alternatives in 95% of the world.\nThe researchers carried out a life-cycle assessment in which they not only calculated greenhouse gas emissions generated when using cars and heating systems, but also in the production chain and waste processing.\nIn 53 of 59 global regions \u2013 including all of Europe, the US and China \u2013 the findings show electric cars and heat pumps are already less emission-intensive than fossil-fuel alternatives.\nThe paper is published in the journal Nature Sustainability.\nFollow Roger \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14F82/production/_108609858_gettyimages-909742720.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-51857722": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-51857722", "title": "The 'climate doomers' preparing for society to fall apart", "published": "Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:05:13 GMT", "summary": "Few scientists think climate change will cause society to collapse any time soon - but some people are getting ready anyway.", "story": "An article by a British professor that predicts the imminent collapse of society, as a result of climate change, has been downloaded over half a million times. Many mainstream climate scientists totally reject his claims, but his followers are already preparing for the worst.\nAs the last light of the late-winter sunset illuminates her suburban back garden, Rachel Ingrams is looking at the sky and pondering how long we have left.\nHer hands shielded from the gusts of February air by a well-worn pair of gardening gloves, Rachel carefully places tree spinach and scarlet pimpernel seeds into brown plastic pots.\nOver the past year, Rachel, 45, has invested in a greenhouse and four bright blue water butts, and started building a raised vegetable patch out of planks of wood. It's all part of an effort to rewild her garden and become as close to self-sufficient as she can, while society continues to function.\nWithin the next five to 10 years, she says, climate change is going to cause it to fall apart. \"I don't see things lasting any longer than that.\"\nSo every evening, after picking up her children from school and returning to their former council house, she spends about two hours working outside.\n\"I find the more I do it, the less anxious I am,\" she says. \"It's better than just sitting in the living room looking at the news and thinking, 'Oh God, climate change is happening, what do we do?'\"\nRachel is unsure about how much to tell her three daughters. \"I don't say to them that in five years we won't be here,\" she tells me. \"But they do accept that food will be difficult to find.\"\nEvery six weeks, she takes her two youngest daughters on an 450-mile round trip from their home in Sheffield to an organic farm in South Wales, where they learn how to forage for food. It's vital for them to learn \"skills we'll be able to use in the natural world when all our systems have broken down,\" she says.\n\"I don't think what they're learning in school is the right stuff any more, given what we're facing. They need to be learning permaculture [self-sufficient agriculture] and other stuff, ancient stuff that we've forgotten how to do. We just go to Tesco.\"\nBut she's not at all confident her efforts will make much difference, in the long run. \"I don't think we can save the human race,\" she says, \"but hopefully we can leave the planet with some organic life.\"\nAround a year ago, a video of a talk by a British professor called Jem Bendell appeared on Rachel's Twitter feed.\n\"As soon as I saw it, everything seemed to make sense in a terrifying way,\" Rachel says.\n\"It felt like a bolt from the blue: 'We're all going to die.' I felt it in my bones that we are at the beginning of the end.\"\nBendell, a professor in sustainable leadership at the University of Cumbria, is the author of an academic article, Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy, which has become the closest thing to a manifesto for a generation of self-described \"climate doomers\".\nIn it, he argues that it is too late for us to avoid \"the inevitability of societal collapse\" caused by climate change. Instead, we are facing a \"near-term\" breakdown of civilisation - near-term meaning within about a decade.\nThe paper was rejected for publication by a peer-reviewed journal, whose reviewers said its language was \"not appropriate for an academic article\".\nIt is certainly unconventional, with its disturbing descriptions of what's to come. \"You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before starving to death,\" Bendell writes.\nAfter the journal's rejection, in July 2018 Bendell self-published the 34-page article online.\nIt soon went viral. It has now been downloaded over half a million times, translated into a dozen languages, and sparked a global movement with thousands of followers - called Deep Adaptation, because Bendell calls on people to adapt their lifestyle to cope with the harsh conditions in his vision of the future.\nBut Bendell's stark predictions have been dismissed by prominent climate scientists.\nProf Michael Mann, one of the world's most renowned, describes Bendell's paper as \"pseudo-scientific nonsense\".\n\"To me, the Bendell paper is a perfect storm of misguidedness and wrongheadedness,\" Mann says. \"It is wrong on the science and its impacts. There is no credible evidence that we face 'inevitable near-term collapse'.\"\nWhat's more, Mann claims, Bendell's \"doomist framing\" is \"disabling\" and will \"lead us down the very same path of inaction as outright climate change denial. Fossil fuel interests love this framing.\" Bendell is, he says, \"a poster child for the dangerous new strain of crypto-denialism\". \nMyles Allen, professor of Geosystem Science at the University of Oxford, is just as critical.\n\"Predictions of societal collapse in the next few years as a result of climate change seem very far-fetched,\" he tells me. \n\"So far, the system's responded to greenhouse gas emissions almost exactly as predicted. So to say it's about to change and become much worse is speculation.\n\"Honestly this kind of material is at the level of science of the anti-vax campaign.\"\nAllen agrees with Mann that the paper's pessimism is liable to make people feel powerless. \"Lots of people are using this kind of catastrophism to argue that there's no point in reducing emissions,\" he says.\nBendell rejects the scientists' claims and says people have been inspired by his paper to demand radical government measures to tackle climate change.\n\"I hope Michael Mann gets to meet some more climate activists on the streets, so he can meet the new breed of fearless people taking peaceful direct action after being moved by uncompromising assessments of our situation,\" he says. \"Many of the leaders of Extinction Rebellion read my paper and quit their jobs to go full time to try to reduce harm and save what we can.\"\nOther climate scientists say they have more time for Bendell.\n\"With global emissions continuing to rise, and no signs that the Paris targets will be respected, Jem Bendell has some justification in taking the strong position that it is already too late and we'd better prepare to deal with the collapse of the globalised economic system,\" says Prof Will Steffen, from Australia's Climate Change Council.\n\"Jem may, in fact, be 'ahead of the game' in warning us about what we might need to prepare for.\"\nHe adds that there is a \"credible risk\" that even a 2C rise in global average temperatures above pre-industrial levels could initiate a \"a tipping cascade... taking our climate system out of our control and on to a Hothouse Earth state\".\n\"I can't say for sure that Jem Bendell is right\u2026 but we certainly can't rule it out.\"\nIn its bleak forecasts and direct language, Bendell's paper has had an electrifying effect on many who have read it. Almost 10,000 people have joined a \"Positive Deep Adaptation\" Facebook group and about 3,000 are members of an online forum.\nHere, the movement's followers exchange ideas about how they can adapt their lives, businesses and communities in accordance with Deep Adaptation doctrine.\nIn the paper, Bendell proposes a \"Deep Adaptation Agenda\" - a conceptual roadmap for how to cope with the economic, political and environmental shocks he believes are coming our way.\nHe urges people to think about the aspects of our current way of life we will be able to hold on to and those we will have to let go of, referring to these two ideas as Resilience and Relinquishment.\nHe also talks about a third R, Restoration, which refers to old skills and habits that we will have to bring back. For some, such as Rachel, \"restoration\" means rewilding their gardens and local neighbourhoods, learning foraging skills and imagining how to survive in a world without electricity.\nFor others it's about leaving the city or heavily populated areas of the country and heading for the hills.\nLionel Kirbyshire, a 60-year-old former chemicals engineer, says he began getting deeply worried about the climate a few years ago. He read, among other things, some of the writings of Guy MacPherson, a controversial American scientist unaffiliated to Deep Adaptation, who predicts humans will be extinct by 2030.\nHis head was soon \"boiling with all this information that no-one wants to know\".\n\"There was a moment about a year ago when it hit me and I thought, 'We're in big trouble,'\" he says. \"When you look at the whole picture it's terrifying. I think we've got 10 years, but we'll be lucky to make it.\"\nA few months after reading the Deep Adaptation paper, Lionel and his wife, Jill, decided to move north. They sold their house in densely populated Bedfordshire and relocated to a three-bedroom terraced house in the small town of Cupar, Fife. \n\"In the back of my mind, [I think] when the crunch comes, there'll be a lot of people in a small area and it's going to be mayhem - and we'll be safer if we move further north because it's colder.\"\nThey expect their grown-up children will join them in the coming years. In the meantime Lionel is investing in some growing boxes, in order to create raised vegetable beds in his garden, a foraging manual and water purification tablets.\n\"We're not stockpiling food but as the years go on I can't see us having much left.\"\nAnother Deep Adaptation follower, who didn't want his name to be published, told me he was planning to relocate from the South-East to the Welsh countryside. \n\"The basic things we'll need will be food, water and shelter,\" he says.\nHe plans to live off-grid, either joining an existing eco-community or \"going it alone\" with like-minded friends in a house clad with straw bales for insulation. \n\"Deep Adaptation isn't a bunker mentality of doing it yourself. You want a mix of people with different skills,\" he says.\nBut he also says he has been taking crossbow lessons, \"because you never know\".\n\"It seems like a pretty useful weapon to have around to protect ourselves. I'd hate the thought I'd ever have to use it but the thought of standing by and not being able to protect the ones I love is pretty horrifying.\"\nJem Bendell says Deep Adaptation advocates non-violence. Its online platforms ban members from discussing \"fascistic or violent approaches to the situation\".\nThough it didn't appear in Bendell's first paper he later added a fourth R, Reconciliation, which is all about living in peace. And when I finally get through to him, after two months of unreturned emails and conversations with his colleagues in the Deep Adaptation \"core team\", he puts a big emphasis on love.\n\"People are rising up in love in response to their despair and fear,\" he tells me. \"[Deep Adaptation] seems to have reached people in all walks of life, at least in the West - heads of banks, UN agencies, European Commission divisions, political parties, religious leaders...\"\nHis message, he says, is one of \"putting love and truth first\".\nAt present, the professor's followers often feel that their truth they believe in is ignored and dismissed by the rest of society.\nLionel says that among people he meets \"no-one wants to talk about it\".\nHe's joined several online groups - with names like Near-Term Human Extinction Support Group and Collapse Chronicles - where he can share his despair.\n\"Sometimes I say that I'm feeling quite low and someone will say they're feeling the same,\" he tells me. \"So you know you're not in it alone.\"\nRachel tells me that she also sometimes feels isolated. Her attempts to get her neighbours to collaborate in a community compost heap have mostly fallen on deaf ears, so she turns to Deep Adaptation's online forums to find support.\n\"It's much easier when you have a group to face the tragedy unfolding before us. If I am feeling anxious, hopeless or full of grief I can go on there and tell them how I'm feeling.\n\"There are 9,000 people all over the world, so you can post on there in the middle of the night and get support. I post ideas about my compost bin and get lots of messages back with people being encouraging.\"\nHowever, she thinks there will be a day when the electricity is cut off, so she is learning to recite poems by heart, in case she finds herself alone, with no internet or possessions.\n\"At least I'll have something to carry with me.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1561F/production/_111238578_976xbiggerdsc02977.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51954988": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51954988", "title": "Grace gravity mission captures Greenland ice loss", "published": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 23:20:28 GMT", "summary": "The US-German Grace satellites saw Greenland shed 600 billion tonnes of ice by the end of summer last year.", "story": "Greenland shed an extraordinary 600 billion tonnes of ice by the end of summer last year.\nThis melt-driven loss would have raised global sea levels by 2.2mm, say scientists who've just published an analysis of satellite gravity measurements taken over the Arctic.\nOf course, when winter set in, some of that mass would have been recovered as it snowed across the ice sheet.\nThe data comes from the joint US-German space mission known as Grace-FO.\nIt's actually a pair of satellites that circle the globe, sensing the \"lumps and bumps\" in Earth's gravity field that correspond to variations in mass.\nKey signals being detected are changes in the amount of water stored on land surfaces and the withering state of the planet's great ice fields.   \nFO stands for \"follow on\" because the project is a successor to a mission that flew from 2002 to 2017.\nThe analysis appearing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) on Wednesday is essentially a first attempt to match up the new observational tool with the old.\nIt's a task that was made more challenging than it should have been, concede scientists. \nIn part that was because there was a seven-month gap in operations (Grace-FO wasn't launched until 2018), but also because the new mission, once in orbit, was found to be carrying an underperforming accelerometer instrument.\nThe team has had to find a work-around for this disappointment.\n\"But the exciting news is we are working and we are working well. And that's important because Grace gives us a really unique way of looking at the ice sheets and their glaciers,\" Prof Isabella Velicogna, from the University of California at Irvine and the US space agency's (Nasa) Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told BBC News.\nOther types of satellite measure the ice sheets by capturing changes in velocity or shape. Grace, on the other hand, literally weighs the ice from orbit. It's therefore an independent check on those other satellites' methods.\nThe big take-home from the GRL paper is that the new gravity mission is capturing all major trends.\nThe Greenland melt of last summer would have been hard to miss. It was extreme. On a par with the very warm summer of 2012.\nIn the coastal town of Ilulissat, not far from where the mighty Jakobshavn Glacier enters the ocean, temperatures reached into the high 20s Celsius. \nAnd even in the ice sheet's interior, at its highest point, temperatures got to about zero.\n\"It's significant that we're now seeing melt and mass loss extending to Greenland's northern glaciers. All of Greenland contributed to the big summer melt of last year,\" said Prof Velicogna.\nAcross the entire period of the two missions - 2002 to 2019 - Greenland has lost some 4,550 billion tonnes of ice, an average of 268 billion tonnes annually, which puts the scale of last summer into further context.\nIn Antarctica, for the full Grace period, the ice sheet is seen to be losing just over 100 billion tonnes every year. The match-up between the old and new gravity measurements is not quite as consistent as in Greenland, but this should improve with time, commented Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University, UK. \n\"This is the first effort to cross-calibrate the missions which is really welcome because the Grace gravity data is important for our science. That's a massive positive. No-one expects a first paper, the first data from a mission, to be perfect; the processing of the data can only get better,\" he told BBC News.@BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10313/production/_101632366_one.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772", "title": "What is climate change?

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

How much carbon dioxide do trees really pull in from the atmosphere? And what happens to a forest, planted amid a fanfare, over the following decades?\nLast year's UK general election became a contest to look green. \nThe Conservatives' pledge of planting 30 million trees a year, confirmed in the Budget this week, is a big step up on current rates. Critics wonder whether it's possible given that earlier targets were far easier and weren't met. \nIf the new planting rate is achieved, it would lead to something like 17% of the UK becoming forested, as opposed to 13% now. \nTree planting is a popular idea because forests are not only beautiful but also useful: they support wildlife, help with holding back floodwater and provide timber.\nAnd trees absorb carbon dioxide - the main gas heating the planet - so planting more of them is seen by many as a climate change solution.\nAt the moment, the UK's forests pull in about 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year but the hope is to more than double that.\nIt would involve potentially sensitive decisions about where to turn fields into forests: for example, should trees be planted where crops are grown or where cattle or sheep are grazed?\nAnd because it can take decades to get a financial return from trees, many farmers and landowners are waiting for the government to announce new incentives.\nYes, with the right people. \nI watched a team of people in their 20s working on a project for the Forestry Commission, in Norfolk, and their speed was phenomenal. When they got going, I timed each of them planting a tree roughly every four seconds. \nDuring the course of a day, they could plant between 2,000 and 4,000 trees, piercing the soil with a shovel, stooping down to bury the roots of a tiny Douglas Fir, pressing the sapling in with a boot, and then pacing out the gap to the next one. \nThere are machines that can do the job - and even drones - but people power is the tried and tested method. And good money can be earned - about 7p for every tree.\nFor years, it's been popular among students in Canada as a summer job. But inspiring the same enthusiasm among British people is a different story.\nLiz Boivin, whose company Tomorrow's Forests employs the team I visited, finds it is Canadians, Australians and eastern Europeans who most regularly sign up for a season's work. \nShe doubts whether there are enough trained staff in Britain to support the government's plans for a huge increase in planting. \n\"You need to have the workforce to hit those numbers, which at the moment you don't have,\" she says. \nTrees grow very slowly so it's not enough just to plant them and then walk away. \nIn their early years, saplings are extremely vulnerable to a long list of threats: droughts, storms, pests and diseases. So it's possible that around a quarter of a newly-planted forest will die young.\nOnly when the survivors make it to an age of 20-30 years do they draw in significant amounts of carbon dioxide. By this stage, the forest will only thrive if some trees are removed or \"thinned\" to allow more room for others to develop. \nIf the timber from the cleared trees is then used in buildings, the carbon will remain locked up for as long as the structure stands. But if the trees are left unattended and end up dying and rotting, all the carbon that had been stored will then be released. \nSo the key is a plan for careful management, according to Stuart Goodall, who runs Confor, a forest industries association. He's worried that the mania for trees may turn out to be a passing fashion, with investors excited by the planting but not by the long years that follow.\n\"We don't want to be rushed by others who have taken a sudden interest and may run away in 5-10 years' time,\" he says.\nFor a big increase in tree planting, Mr Goodall says there will need to be far greater supply of saplings but British nurseries are wary of scaling up until they're sure the government is serious.\nThe answer is more complicated than you might think.\nTrees use carbon dioxide as part of the process of photosynthesis - with the carbon ending up in the branches, trunk and roots. But at the same time they rely on respiration, which releases some carbon dioxide. \nThat's why, over the years, people have described trees as \"breathing\" - inhaling and exhaling a flow of gases. And it turns out that understanding exactly how that flow works is extremely hard. \nProf Rob MacKenzie, of the University of Birmingham, is honest about the lack of knowledge. \"There are lots of things we don't know about the precise movement of carbon.\"\nWe're in a hi-tech outdoor laboratory that he runs in a forest in Staffordshire.\nInstruments are mounted on tree trunks and on the ground to measure every aspect of how the trees are functioning. Research so far has shown that every square metre draws in about 1,700g of CO2 every year - while also releasing up to 1,200g.\nAnd as a forest gets older, those flows are likely to become more balanced. Prof MacKenzie says it would be a \"disaster\" if governments and companies rely on forests to \"clear up the mess\" of carbon pollution.\nAnd he paints a grim picture of what could go wrong. \"We plant lot of trees, we think we've done the job, we forget about them, and what we're left with is a really desolate dying diseased landscape that no one cares about.\"\nPartly, they involve choosing the right trees and partly it's about making sure that local people benefit.\nIn the sprawling forest of Thetford, in Norfolk, much of it planted in a rush after the First World War, Eleanor Tew has researched the best options.\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, a government-encouraged rash of planting ended up with regimented rows of the same species of conifers - which meant they were susceptible to the same pests and diseases.\nFor Eleanor, it's important to make sure that future forests are more resilient. \n\"It's a bit like making sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket,\" she says. \"It may seem that the obvious thing is to plant one species that's really good for timber or another species that's good for carbon but if they don't cope with a disease, then the whole forest fails.\"\nAnd for Nathalie Seddon, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford, it's vital that forestry schemes, particularly in developing countries, aren't imposed on the people there, but instead involve them. \nShe points to a project in the Humbo region of Ethiopia where farmers were encouraged to regenerate woodland by being given legal rights over the trees and also by getting training in forest management.\nBy contrast, a forestry scheme in northwest China successfully protected people living there from dust storms - a positive development - but the growth of the trees then led to water shortages in villages downstream.\nShe says: \"There is an idea that you can just buy land and plant trees but that's too simplistic - there is a risk of doing more harm than good.\"\nFollow David on Twitter..  \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17CFD/production/_111233579_dsc_0493al-2.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51742646": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51742646", "title": "Climate change boosted Australia bushfire risk by at least 30%", "published": "Wed, 04 Mar 2020 17:00:05 GMT", "summary": "Scientists quantify the role played by warming in the country's recent bushfires.", "story": "Scientists have published the first assessment quantifying the role of climate change in the recent Australian bushfires.\nGlobal warming boosted the risk of the hot, dry weather that's likely to cause bushfires by at least 30%, they say.\nBut the study suggests the figure is likely to be much greater.\nIt says that if global temperatures rise by 2C, as seems likely, such conditions would occur at least four times more often.\nThe analysis has been carried out by the World Weather Attribution consortium.\nCo-author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt, The Netherlands, told the BBC even the study's very conservative estimates were troubling.\n\"Last year the fire prevention system in Australia, which is extremely well prepared for bushfires, was straining.

These include increased water use making the land drier, urban heating effects or unknown local factors.\nNevertheless, Prof Jan van Oldenborgh and 17 fellow climate scientists from six countries gave it their best shot. \"It was by far the most complex study we have undertaken,\" he told the BBC. \nThe researchers found the climate models consistently underestimated the observed increase in temperatures in south-east Australia and so could not pinpoint a figure for the increased risk from climate change.

Even so, the modelling suggests the larger slope failures could produce waves as high as 40m on the territory's southern shoreline, and perhaps as tall as 10m at the capital, Port Stanley.\n\"We must stress these are old events that we've looked at; we don't want to put the fear of God into people,\" said BGS Prof Dave Tappin. \"But the more events and case histories we study - even if they are millions of years old or a hundred thousand years old - the better we can understand not only how such tsunami are generated but also their likely future hazard.\"\nOne puzzle for the team has been to explain how a particular location on Burdwood Bank turned into such a prolific \"landslide factory\", and the scientists think they do now have a persuasive narrative.\nIt involves the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), the northern-most branch, or jet, of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).\nThe ACC is the most powerful movement of water on Earth and where the SAF skirts the bank it can be accelerated in places so that it becomes a highly erosive force.\nThe front will be picking up sediment at one location and then dumping it at another.\nThis accumulation site, dubbed Burdwood Drift, is the high, steep slope evident in the seismic data.\nThe emplaced silt and sand is clearly growing again but it's impossible right now for anyone to say if or when another slide might occur.\nInternal instabilities could eventually activate the slope, but a more seeming scenario is that shaking from a local quake provokes a collapse of the sediment. After all, the bank is relatively close to tectonic plate boundaries.\nFuture research would involve digging on the Falklands to try to find deposits from ancient tsunami. \n\"You maybe even want to sample the drift to see what it consists of, what the shear strength of the material is; and then you can put all this information into your models to refine them,\" said Dr Nicholson.\nProf Dan Parsons is director of the Energy and Environment Institute at Hull University. His group studies submarine landslides and comments that the consequences of these phenomena are little appreciated. \n\"The impacts on both tsunami generation and also the impact on sub-sea infrastructure can be significant,\" he told BBC News. \n\"The vast majority of our internet connectivity is piped through fibre cables laying across the sea-floor - in essence, the cloud is at the bottom of the sea. These cables can be, and are, broken by sub-sea movements, failures and flows - and that can be as impactful in terms of national security as a large tsunami.\"\nThe current study is reported in the journal Marine Geology.@BBCAmos and follow me on Twitter: \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11DF7/production/_111270237_4.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51963486": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51963486", "title": "Coronavirus: When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal?", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 21:00:45 GMT", "summary": "The huge challenge the world faces to find an exit strategy to end the lockdowns and return to normal.", "story": "The world is shutting down. Places that were once teeming with the hustle and bustle of daily life have become ghost-towns with massive restrictions put on our lives - from lockdowns and school closures to travel restrictions and bans on mass gatherings.\nIt is an unparalleled global response to a disease. But when will it end and when will we be able to get on with our lives?\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the UK can \"turn the tide\" against the outbreak within the next 12 weeks and the country can \"send coronavirus packing\".\nBut even if the number of cases starts to fall in the next three months, then we will still be far from the end.\nIt can take a long time for the tide to go out - possibly years.\nIt is clear the current strategy of shutting down large parts of society is not sustainable in the long-term. The social and economic damage would be catastrophic.\nWhat countries need is an \"exit strategy\" - a way of lifting the restrictions and getting back to normal.\nBut the coronavirus is not going to disappear. \nIf you lift the restrictions that are holding the virus back, then cases will inevitably soar. \n\"We do have a big problem in what the exit strategy is and how we get out of this,\" says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.\n\"It's not just the UK, no country has an exit strategy.\"\nIt is a massive scientific and societal challenge.\nThere are essentially three ways out of this mess.\nEach of these routes would reduce the ability of the virus to spread. \nA vaccine should give someone immunity so they do not become sick if they are exposed. \nImmunise enough people, about 60% of the population, and the virus cannot cause outbreaks - the concept known as herd immunity.\nThe first person was given an experimental vaccine in the US this week after researchers were allowed to skip the usual rules of performing animal tests first.\nVaccine research is taking place at unprecedented speed, but there is no guarantee it will be successful and will require immunisation on a global scale. \nThe best guess is a vaccine could still be 12 to 18-months away if everything goes smoothly. That is a long time to wait when facing unprecedented social restrictions during peacetime. \n\"Waiting for a vaccine should not be honoured with the name 'strategy', that is not a strategy,\" Prof Woolhouse told the BBC.\nThe UK's short-term strategy is to drive down cases as much as possible to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed - when you run out of intensive care beds then deaths spike.\nOnce cases are suppressed, it may allow some measures to be lifted for a while - until cases rise and another round of restrictions are needed. \nWhen this might be is uncertain. The UK's chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said \"putting absolute timelines on things is not possible\".\nDoing this could, unintentionally, lead to herd immunity as more and more people were infected. \nBut this could take years to build up, according to Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London: \"We're talking about suppressing transmission at a level whereby, hopefully, only a very small fraction of the country will be infected. \n\"So eventually, if we continued this for two-plus years, maybe a sufficient fraction of the country at that point might have been infected to give some degree of community protection.\"\nBut there is a question mark over whether this immunity will last. Other coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms, lead to a very weak immune response and people can catch the same bug multiple times in their lifetime. \n\"The third option is permanent changes in our behaviour that allow us to keep transmission rates low,\" Prof Woolhouse said.\nThis could include keeping some of the measures that have been put in place. Or introducing rigorous testing and isolation of patients to try to stay on top of any outbreaks.\n\"We did early detection and contact tracing the first time round and it didn't work,\" Prof Woolhouse adds.\nDeveloping drugs that can successfully treat a Covid-19 infection could aid the other strategies too.\nThey could be used as soon as people show symptoms in a process called \"transmission control\" to stop them passing it onto others.\nOr to treat patients in hospital to make the disease less deadly and reduce pressures on intensive care. This would allow countries to cope with more cases before needing to reintroduce lockdowns.\nIncreasing the number of intensive care beds would have a similar effect by increasing the capacity to cope with larger outbreaks. \nI asked the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, what his exit strategy was. \nHe told me: \"Long term, clearly a vaccine is one way out of this and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.\"\nAnd that \"globally, science will come up with solutions\".\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11FB8/production/_111365637_gettyimages-1204264776-1.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51914782": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51914782", "title": "How to argue with a racist: Five myths debunked", "published": "Mon, 16 Mar 2020 15:41:21 GMT", "summary": "Stereotypes and myths about race are not just used by racists. Here's how to debunk five myths.", "story": "Stereotypes and myths about race abound, but this does not make them true. Often, these are not even expressed by overt racists.\nFor many well-intentioned people, experience and cultural history has steered them towards views that aren't supported by human genetics. For example: the assumption that East Asian students are inherently better at maths, black people have natural rhythm, or Jews are good with money.  Many of us know someone who thinks along these lines.\nDr Adam Rutherford, a geneticist and BBC presenter, says \"Racism is being expressed in public more openly today than at any time I can recall, and it's our duty to contest it with facts.\"\nHere's how to debunk five racist myths with science and facts.\nThe primary pigment in human skin is melanin. It's used to protect us from the sun. \nIt absorbs the sun's ultra violet rays before they can destroy folate, one of the body's key vitamins.\nMany genes are involved in the biochemical pathways that result in melanin production. Natural variation within these genes is the root cause of the spectrum of skin tones that humans have.\nSo, the biggest genetic difference within the human race is between white people and black people, right? Wrong.\nFirstly, all humans share almost all the same DNA - a fact that betrays all of our recent origins from Africa.\nSecondly, there is more genetic diversity on the continent of Africa than in the rest of the world put together.\nTwo people from different tribes in Southern Africa will be more genetically different from each other than a Sri Lankan, a M\u0101ori and a Russian.\nWe might categorise people as white, black or brown, but these visual variations don't accurately reflect the genetic differences - or rather similarities - between us.\nWe think of certain areas, lands or peoples as being isolated - either physically or culturally - and these boundaries as being insurmountable. \nBut this is neither what history, nor genetics, tell us. In fact, no nation is static.\n\"People have moved around the world throughout history, and had sex whenever and wherever they could,\" says Dr Rutherford. \nSometimes these are big moves in short times. \nMore often, people are largely static over a few generations - and that can feel like a geographical and cultural anchor.\n\"Nevertheless, every Nazi has Jewish ancestors\" says Dr Rutherford, \"Every white supremacist has Middle Eastern ancestors. Every racist has African, Indian, East Asian ancestors, as well as everyone else.\" \n\"Racial purity is pure fantasy. For humans, there are no pure bloods. Only mongrels enriched by the blood of multitudes,\" he says.\nSome people experience a lot of angst about migrants and refugees coming to their country, a phenomenon that has been experienced in many places around the world of late.  \nAmong recent examples, the shooting rampage last month that started in a shisha bar in Hanau, Germany, was motivated by a far-right doctrine to expel or murder immigrants.\nThose on the far right have long expressed anger in the form of epithets: \"Germany for the Germans\", \"France for the French\", \"Turkey for the Turks\" and \"Italy for Italians\" have all been used as anti-immigration phrases by far-right groups. \n\"Go back to where you came from\" is an offensive phrase that resonates all over the world.\nIn truth, countries like Germany, France, Turkey and Italy have had immigration throughout their history.  In fact, just about everywhere has.  \nThe British Isles, for instance, have become home to migrants since they separated from the continent around 7,500 years ago.\nBefore the French took over in 1066, that part of the world had been invaded by Vikings, Angles, Saxons, Huns, and dozens of other smaller tribes and clans.\nAnd even before that, the Romans ruled, which in their turn came from all over the intercontinental empire, which reached as far as sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.\nEarlier still, around 4,500 years ago Britain was populated primarily by farmers, who had migrated from Europe across what was continuous terrain between the Netherlands and East Anglia. \nOn the basis of DNA evidence, we think they may have been olive skinned, with dark hair and brown eyes. \nAnd before them there were hunter-gatherers, who had even darker skin.\nSo, when political parties or even racists say: \"France for the French\", or \"Italy for the Italians\" and talk about \"indigenous\" people... who do they actually mean?\nGenealogy and ancestry fascinate us - and racists in particular.\nWebsites like Stormfront are frequented by white nationalist, white supremacist, and anti-Semitic members who forward theories for Holocaust-denial and are obsessed with population genetics.\nThey use mainstream genealogy tests, like those offered by Ancestry DNA, to \"prove\" they are 100% white or non-Jewish.\nHowever, the logic is flawed.\nDNA can tell you some interesting things about family history - and it's very useful for identifying close family like lost siblings or biological parents - but its powers are profoundly limited by fundamental biology.\nOver time, descendants start to shed the DNA of their actual ancestors, and the amount that vanishes builds up over the generations to be huge..\nYou carry DNA from only half of your ancestors dating eleven generations back. So it is possible that you are genetically unrelated to people you are actually descended from as recently as the 18th Century.\n\"You are descended from multitudes, from all around the world, from people you think you know and from more you know nothing about,\" says Dr Rutherford, \"You will have no meaningful genetic link to many of them.\"\nThe last white man to compete in a 100m final at the Olympics was in 1980. \nSince then, black athletes have dominated the modern era of sprinting. This has fuelled a commonly held belief that people of African descent have an advantage at the sport because of their genetic ancestry.\n\"Maybe there are probabilistic predictions one could make about ethnicity and sporting success based on genetics,\" says Dr Rutherford, \"but they would be weak at best.\"\nIn actual fact, the genetics of sporting success are wickedly complex.\nThere are a myriad of factors in physiology of physicality, including the size of your heart, the efficiency with which you absorb oxygen, and muscular recovery, says Rutherford. \nAnd these are relatively well understood phenomena which do have a genetic basis.  But there are other physical traits (such as flexibility and co-ordination) which are less well understood. \nOn top of that, there's the psychological dimension: determination, concentration, and risk-taking, for example.\nWe do know that people who are good at explosive-energy sports tend to have a higher proportion of \"fast-twitch\" muscle cells, that process energy more quickly. \nThe genetics that underlie this involve a gene called ACTN3.\nStudies have shown that elite athletes in power and strength sports are more likely to have copies of the R-type of ACTN3. The research indicates the gene occurs in a higher proportion of African Americans (96%) compared to white Americans (80%).\nThat does give a slight, population-wide advantage to African Americans to take place in explosive-energy sports - but it doesn't come anywhere close to explaining the difference between the number of African American sprinters and white competitors. \nIf it just came down to that gene, you might expect to see six black elite sprinters for every five white runners.\nAdam says this is a simplistic analysis, but still a good example of how genetics don't align with racial stereotypes in sports. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D65A/production/_110947845_6b4b21e5-e37a-4770-a031-caad5231f2fd.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51747272": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51747272", "title": "Europe's major telescopes 'can meet satellite challenge'", "published": "Thu, 05 Mar 2020 08:26:53 GMT", "summary": "Europe's flagship telescopes will cope with the effects of thousands of new satellites in the sky.", "story": "Europe's flagship telescopes will be \"moderately affected\" by the new satellite mega-constellations now being launched, according to a new study.\nHaving thousands more bright objects in the sky will create inconvenience and extra cost, but the idea that astronomy faces some kind of a \"cliff edge\" is not correct, says Olivier Hainaut.\nHe's calculated how observing time might be limited by having 26,000 additional spacecraft in orbit.\nAnd it's manageable, he believes.\nDr Hainaut works for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) organisation which operates world-class facilities in Chile's Atacama Desert, including the VLT (Very Large Telescope) and the forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).\nNeither is likely to be deeply troubled by the wave of new broadband satellites being launched by companies such as SpaceX of California and London-based OneWeb.\n\"We will lose some telescope time due to the satellites crossing the field of view. For us, for ESO telescopes, this is something that we can mitigate by scheduling, and by 'closing the shutter' when they pass overhead,\" Dr Hainaut told BBC News.\n\"It has a cost, of course; we would need to develop the software to compute the positions of the satellites, etc. That's not horribly complicated, but it will need to be done.\"\nHis study, co-authored with Andrew Williams, has been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\nIt was prompted by the furore that followed the initial launches last year of 60-at-a-time \"Starlink\" satellites from SpaceX. \nThe internet platforms shocked many with their brightness; astronomers complained of streaks in their telescope images. And with thousands more spacecraft in the planning, scientists feared the full roll-out of large constellations might seriously compromise their observations of the cosmos.\nThe ESO study attempts to make a calm forecast of the likely impacts. It necessarily follows some assumptions about the networks' scale and distribution, and the reflectivity of individual spacecraft. But for arguments' sake, it imagines there will be 18 orbiting constellations comprising 26,000 satellites.\nFor this scenario, the research reveals there would be about 1,600 illuminated spacecraft in view (above the horizon) of a mid-latitude observatory like the VLT or the ELT. The vast majority of these spacecraft, however, would be low in the sky; and above 30 degrees \u2014 that portion of the sky where most observations occur \u2014 there would be only about 250 satellites at any given time.\nUp to about 100 satellites could potentially be bright enough to be visible with the naked eye during twilight hours, about 10 of which would be higher than 30 degrees of elevation.\nAll these numbers fall off sharply as more of the sky moves into the shadow of the Earth in the middle of the night.   \nShort exposures on ESO's narrow-field observatories like the VLT and ELT should cope in this scenario.\n\"For a 100-second exposure time at twilight, we would lose 0.3% of the exposures. So, that means for every 1,000 exposures we take, three of them would be ruined by a satellite. And that number goes down as the Sun goes down,\" Dr Hainaut explained.\nBut there are facilities, he concedes, that will be greatly affected. These are the ones dedicated to long exposures on wide fields of view.\nThe example citied is the upcoming NSF Vera C Rubin Observatory (formerly called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope). \nThis will be attempting to draw a map of the entire sky every three days. Its wide field of view and remarkable sensitivity to anything that's moving in sight of its detectors will make Vera Rubin especially vulnerable to interference.\nIf no mitigating strategy is introduced for this telescope, up to 40% of its imagery at twilight hours could be unusable.\nFor ESO, its greatest concern centres on the Vista telescope. This is a wide-field observatory that was paid for by the UK when it joined the organisation in 2002.\nIt's about to be fitted with a new fibre-optic spectroscopic camera, able to capture the detailed colours of 2,400 objects simultaneously, over an area on the sky equivalent to 20 full Moons. \nIn the worst case, up to 30 fibres could be affected by a satellite trailing across the sky.\n\"Once you crunch the numbers, the numbers are not as bad as what some people feared,\" Dr Hainaut told BBC News.  \"People said 'oh no, there'll be 40,000 bright satellites in the sky? No, there won't be, simply because most of these satellites will be below the horizon, and then most of the others will be in the shadow of the Earth. That's the first bit of good news. \n\"The second bit of good news is that the space industry, and specifically Space X and OneWeb are talking to us. They are really listening.\"\nThe two companies have promised to work with the astronomical community to limit the interference as much as possible.\nHainaut and Williams' study only concerned itself with optical/infrared telescopes. Radio telescopes will face a separate challenge of interference if the mega-constellation internet satellites transmit outside their designated wavelength bands. \nAnd Dr Hainaut goes out of his way to stress the limitations imposed on the study by the assumptions made. \nFor example, today no-one really knows how many satellites will be launched. It could be less than 26,000; it could be substantially more. Problems will certainly scale if there are more.\nAnd no-one knows just how bright the different designs of spacecraft will be.

And that market is recovering faster than others having already endured coronavirus and seems to be coming out the other side.\"\nHuawei remains the world's second bestselling handset-maker, but had once aimed to overtake Samsung before the end of 2019.Founder Ren Zhengfei told the Wall Street Journal that his firm now planned to boost its wider research and development budget by $5.8bn (\u00a34.8bn) this year, taking it to more than $20bn. And part of that is being spent on building up its own library of apps.\n\"In markets outside of China, we don't see significant [smartphone] growth,\" he added.\n\"We are taking measures to address that.\"\nThere are three versions of the new phones: the standard P40, with a 6.1in screen, and a larger mid-range P40 Pro and high-end Pro+, which both have 6.58in displays. That makes then slightly bigger than Apple's iPhone 11 Pro Max.\nAll support 5G. The basic model has three rear cameras, including one that is capable of a 3x optical zoom - meaning users can tighten in on the subject without sacrificing quality.\nThe P40 Pro adds a time-of-flight depth sensor and upgrades the telephoto lens to a periscope design, allowing light to be reflected into the device to deliver a 5x optical zoom. \nAnd the Pro+ betters this with a 10x optical zoom periscope lens. If a digital effect is employed, the Pro+ can achieve 100x zoom. This matches Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra - but Huawei claims to produce a better shot.\nHuawei also said its phones featured bigger camera sensors than those found in either the Galaxy S20 series or iPhone 11 range, giving it an advantage in low-light situations when the owner does not want to use the flash. \nOther standout features include:\nThe Huawei App Gallery includes TikTok, Telegram, Viber, and Microsoft Office among other products. But beyond Google's apps, it is also missing Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.\nTo help make up for the loss of YouTube, the firm has created its own Huawei Video app. \nIt has signed a deal with BBC Studios to provide access to 300 hours of content.\nHuawei Video will include BBC drama, comedy and factual TV shows in 26 countries outside the UK. \nAnd to replace the Duo video chat app, it offers MeeTime, which it claims offers superior performance in low-light conditions.\n\"The design of the devices is superb - they are very sleek,\" commented Ms Pinto.\n\"And it's clever that they've been able to bring more stability to the ultra-zoom lens than Samsung did with its S20 Ultra, assuming the P40 Pro+ lives up to its promise.\n\"But it remains a hard sell, because would you actually want to use something like MeeTime rather than WhatsApp?\"\nThe P40 and P40 Pro go on sale on 7 April, and start from \u20ac799 (\u00a3742, $890) and \u20ac999 respectively, The P40 Pro+ will be released in June, and is priced at \u20ac1,399.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p087sdws.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52049893": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52049893", "title": "Coronavirus: The sports turning to gaming during lockdown", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:40:44 GMT", "summary": "From boxing to Formula 1, sports are reinventing the way they are played during coronavirus pandemic.", "story": "The punch came in the seventh round: a stinging uppercut from Joe Frazier to the jaw of Lennox Lewis. \nThe former British world champion tried to regain his feet but stumbled back and was counted out by the referee. \nSmokin' Joe raised his glove in victory as thousands of fans watching at home shared the historic moment. \nIn fact, everyone was at home - including the boxers, who, of course, have long been retired.\nLewis himself was watching from self-isolation. He tweeted: \"Congrats to Smokin' Joe on a big win. He caught me with a great shot that... I was never really able to recover from. Hats off to him!\"\nThe event was the latest virtual fight organised by the World Boxing Super Series (WBSS). \nSince coronavirus forced the company to cancel all its real-life events, it's turned to gaming to keep fans entertained with the greatest-ever heavyweights pitted against each other in a tournament series streamed online.\nThe fights are played using computer-versus-computer simulations from the 2011 Electronic Arts game Fight Night Champion. \nBoxing fans all over the world have been tuning in, with the first two contests viewed by nearly half a million people, according to the company. \nCo-founder and promoter of the WBSS (and now the eWBSS), Kalle Sauerland, says he and the industry are desperate for the pandemic to pass so he can get back to filling arenas again. But the German-born, London-bred promoter says he's been blown away by the reaction to his e-sports experiment. \n\"It's been huge success so far and it's growing,\" he said. \"We'll still be boxing promoters at the end of all this but I think now is the time to reinvent the wheel a bit to keep people entertained.\"\nWheels are being reinvented all over the world, across many different sports. \nFormula 1 streamed its first ever Virtual Grand Prix, with full pundit and commentary team. Celebrities including singer Liam Payne and cyclist Sir Chris Hoy played against each other and in teams from their own homes, in isolation.\nTelevision outlets are also getting in on the action. In the US, more than 900,000 viewers tuned in for the inaugural eNascar iRacing Pro Invitational Series on Fox Sports. The network has said it will host an entire series of stock-car races, replacing the ones lost due to the pandemic.\nFor e-sports regulars like Johan Sundstein it's an amusing turn of events. The 26-year-old, known online as N0tail, tops the rankings as the most successful e-sports player of all time, netting almost $7m (\u00a35.85m) so far in prize money for playing Dota 2.  \n\"We've had this eternal conflict of sports versus e-sports and we've been accused of copying from the sports scene, and now we see the sports world taking a note out of the e-sports world, which I find kind of funny.\"\nSundstein is currently in isolation at his home in Portugal but the Danish professional is having to adapt to the circumstances since a competition was cancelled at the last minute due to the virus. \n\"It was such a bitter thing that they cancelled our major tournament,\" he said. \"I personally had an extended break and I was really excited to get to this one and it just got taken away from me in front of my nose. I'm dearly going to miss it.\"\nThe e-sports star has made his name and riches playing for crowds all over the world and is now trying to get into streaming to keep busy and connect with his fans. He admits that for the next few months, at least, \"that's where all the viewers are\". \nThe big e-sports companies know this, too, and already big-prize purse events are being set up to make the most of the near-global lockdown. \nPopular basketball game NBA 2K is hosting its first ever \"3-on-3\" tournament where players can participate online for a prize pool of $25,000.\nGames streaming in general has experienced an explosion in popularity. On Twitch, the largest game platform, week-on-week engagement is growing, with average concurrent viewers now more than 1.5 million, according to Twitch Tracker.\nAmy Bayliss, known by her fans as Bamyleaf, streams four days a week on Twitch and says she's noticed an upturn not only in viewer numbers but also in conversation when she's online. \n\"There's a lot of people turning to live streaming right now because they're home and bored and everyone's feeling isolated,\" she says. \"But it's not just about tuning in to see decent gameplay, it's just as much belonging and community.\"\nThe number of people actually playing games is also growing. On Steam, the largest PC gaming platform in the world, a new record was reached on Sunday, with 20.7m players actively gaming or chatting on the platform at the same time. \nWith the boom come concerns from some quarters about how much bandwidth is being used for gaming and the strain it puts on internet networks. Gaming is relatively light on internet usage but downloading games themselves can be very bandwidth-heavy. \nTo combat this, Playstation recently restricted download speeds across Europe, and other companies, including Twitch, have also reduced the quality of streams in order to help internet service providers cope with the overall strain they are now under. \nThe gaming industry, it seems, is working hard to ride the wave of popularity while minimising the impact on services the boom is having. \n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52049520": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52049520", "title": "Coronavirus: UK\u2019s WhatsApp bot working after false start", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 12:42:15 GMT", "summary": "The service, provided by the government, failed to respond to some users when launched on Wednesday.", "story": "A Covid-19 WhatsApp bot set up by the UK government is finally working after problems during launch on Wednesday.\nMembers of the public who message the bot can access pre-determined chunks of advice on symptoms or how to avoid spreading the disease, for example.\nBut it failed to work for some users after its launch, providing nothing more than an error message. \nHowever, the BBC has verified that the bot, which also warns about coronavirus myths, is now working as intended.\nOne of those who encountered initial teething problems, Hashir Milhan, says all seems to be resolved.\n\u201cI tried sending the opening \u2018hi\u2019 message with no response,\u201d London-based designer Mr Milhan told the BBC.\nHe said the bot did respond later \u2013 but only to send him an error message.\nBut on Thursday, he was able to access the information without problems.\nHe noted that the information was generally available online but added: \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring that this comes from a verified account.\u201d\nThe government said the service was designed to allow members of the public to \"get answers to the most common questions about coronavirus\".\nBut Mr Milhan said he had hoped the bot would be able to engage in and understand conversations, in order to respond to queries people might have on the spot.\nTo start receiving messages, users should send \u201chi\u201d via WhatsApp to the number 07860 064422.

A patrol was dispatched to check my whereabouts. A text was sent notifying that the government had lost track of me, and warned me of potential arrest if I had broken quarantine.\nI returned to Taiwan last Thursday to experience the island's zero-risk take on coronavirus. \nSince I was coming back from Europe, I am subjected to a mandatory 14 days home quarantine. Before I had my passport checked, I had to pass through a booth set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. I filled out a document detailing places I had visited in the last fortnight, my phone number, landline and address. They notified me that my phone would be \"satellite-tracked\" for enforcement.\nThe level of precaution taken in Taiwan is nothing like what I saw in Europe.\nDuring the initial phase of lockdown in Belgium, which I had to leave after my study programme was cancelled, people still went out and lined up at fast food kiosks. Even as an outbreak was happening in northern Italy, I saw during my visit to London in the first weekend of March, that people were still going to pubs. \nHere, I am not allowed to step outside the apartment. I was not allowed to take public transport on my way back, and had to take special \"quarantine taxis.\" My entire family has to quarantine with me for two weeks. This includes Biscuit, our dog. \nThe island refers to its phone-tracking system as being an \"electronic fence\".\nRather than ask users to download a special app or wear a location-transmitting wristband - as has been the case in some East Asian countries - it uses existing phone signals to triangulate the owner's locations.\nTo ensure users comply, an alert is sent to the authorities if the handset is turned off for more than 15 minutes. More than 6,000 people subjected to home quarantine are simultaneously tracked this way.\nAnd to check that the phone has not simply been left behind, officials phone users up to twice a day to check they have their mobile to hand, and to ask about their health.\nRecently, many Taiwanese, especially students, have returned to the island, as their schools overseas have closed and life around the world has ground to a halt. Some see the mandatory quarantine they have to go through as a necessary measure.\nFrank Tseng is among them. He is one of my friends at American University, and he recently returned from Washington DC. \n\"I feel like even though it's a pain for the citizens who are coming back, I understand that it's a necessary process many of us have to take to go home,\" he told me.\nBut some see the enforcement mechanism as problematic.\nPaul Huang, a local freelance journalist who was working abroad, decided to not go back to Taiwan because of surveillance fears. \n\"The government openly stated your phone will be digitally tracked to enforce quarantine - in the same way the authority usually tracks suspected criminals,\" he explained.\n\"Except this time they don't have or need a court-issued warrant to spy on your phone. \n\"You are being suspected of a crime by virtue of having travelled overseas.\" \nPaul has published articles critical of the Taiwan government in the past, including one calling its military a \"hollow shell\". \nWhen entering the border, I was only notified that my phone would be tracked and that the local township official would give me a call daily. I was not made aware of any rights I had and did not sign documents consenting to surveillance. \nAs cases of the virus rise in Taiwan, the people seem to have entrusted the government with more power to contain the pandemic. \nBut as the Taiwan government showcases its mass surveillance capability amid the crisis, it brings into question how it can be used in the wrong hands.\nBrian Hioe, who runs New Bloom, a left-leaning publication focused on Taiwan, shared this concern with me. \nHis worry is that \"the state may retain its expanded powers and continue with surveillance practices once the crisis has passed\".\nAt the same time, despite analysis by some that Taiwan's alleged culture of obedience makes it easier to empower the state to contain the outbreak, Brian and I both agree that the vibrant civil society will readily fight back if the government oversteps its power.\nAt the end of the day, I will be staying home to complete my mandatory 14 days of home quarantine without being too paranoid about what the government knows or does not know about me. \nBut I do feel a little uncomfortable knowing that my neighbour could turn me in to the police if they see me outside of my apartment door, doing something as simple as taking out the trash.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8B4C/production/_111406653_d266ae0c-df88-4e84-9534-b20ced09c05b.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52029737": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52029737", "title": "Facebook group calls soar 1,000% during Italy's lockdown", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 01:13:31 GMT", "summary": "The social media platform has seen usage rocket in countries hardest hit by coronavirus lockdowns.", "story": "Facebook has seen usage across its platforms surge in countries that have brought in virus lockdowns.\nItaly - with some of the toughest restrictions - has seen the biggest rise, with group calls rocketing by more than 1,000% in the last month.\nThe social media giant said total messaging traffic on all its platforms had increased 50% on average across the hardest hit countries.\nFacebook owns Instagram along with popular messaging app WhatsApp.\nBut the company said the higher usage won't protect it from expected falls in digital advertising across the world.\n\"We don't monetize many of the services where we're seeing increased engagement,\" Facebook wrote in a post on Tuesday.\nItaly has a death toll now above 6,000 people from the virus.\nAlong with the huge rise in time in group calls (three or more users), the country has seen a 70% rise in time spent on Facebook-owned apps. \nFacebook outlined steps it is taking to increase capacity during the heightened traffic as people are stuck indoors and working from home. \n\"We're monitoring usage patterns carefully, making our systems more efficient, and adding capacity as required,\" the post from Alex Schultz, vice president of analytics, and Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering wrote.\nBut it admitted this could become harder. \"Maintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.

Both countries have seen severe disruptions from the coronavirus with widespread closures of cinemas.\nChina has around 60,000 movie theatres spread across the country, which closed in early January. The timing hit the film industry hard as it came just before Chinese New Year holidays, which normally see $2bn in sales at the box office.\nOne big film, Lost in Russia, went directly to a streaming site and clocked up in excess of 600m views, according to Chinese media reports. It was available for free from Chinese tech giant ByteDance via two of its streaming platforms.\nSo far this year worldwide box office sales are estimated to have fallen by at least $5bn, according to industry analysts, with roughly 50% of that drop in China's market alone. \"We will see that global number escalate in the coming weeks as China remains shut down, and we start to see theatres worldwide follow similar closures,\" said Chris Fenton, author of Feeding the Dragon - Inside the trillion dollar dilemma facing Hollywood, the NBA and American business. \nHe has estimated the industry will lose $15bn in sales for the year as a whole because of closed cinemas, although this figure could grow depending on how long the pandemic lasts.\nIn the US, film studio Universal announced that its three latest cinema releases will be available on streaming platforms while they are still playing in theatres.

The machines get oxygen into the lungs and remove carbon dioxide from the body when people are too sick to breathe on their own. \nThat might sound simple but it is crucial to keep pressure to a minimum to avoid causing further damage. In addition, if the oxygen level is too high, that can do harm.\nAs a result, intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators need to not only keep people breathing but also accurately monitor their lungs, using a mix of airflow, temperature, humidity and pressure sensors. Hospitals across the world now urgently need more of this kit.\nIn the UK, the government is speaking to a wide range of manufacturers to see if they can lend a hand. The goal is to have \"many times\" the current number - about 20,000 additional machines as quickly as possible.\n\"The fact the government is asking manufacturers to make a different product to what they normally make is unprecedented since the World War Two,\" Justin Benson, from the consultancy KMPG, said. \"It's a relatively complex piece of equipment with lots of components and a dedicated supply chain. So asking someone who makes a car to produce a respirator would take them some time.\"\nOthers are more plain spoken about the idea ventilator assembly lines could be established at places such as Honda's Swindon plant.\n\"It would take too long,\" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the engineering trade body Make UK. \"We already have companies that build other people's designs for them - everything from alarm systems to signalling systems for trains. These are the companies you need, which can place components on circuit boards, do the wiring, testing and assembling. Building cars is a very different matter.\"\nSo while big name manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce and JCB have also been invited to discuss playing a role, it could be lesser known companies that take the lead.\nGloucestershire-based Renishaw is one to have already been approached by the Cabinet Office. The company makes small precision-measurement parts, which are used in other types of medical equipment as well as aircraft.\n\"We're still trying to understand the medical device requirements,\" said spokesman Chris Pockett. \"But we're willing and want to contribute to the national effort.\"\nWoking-headquartered TT Electronics is another potential contributor. It makes speciality coils and ultra-fine wound wire for radiation therapy equipment and surgical navigation devices.\nAlthough its involvement with ventilators has been limited to producing power supplies, a spokeswoman said it was \"ready to help in any way that we can\".\nOther parts, however, may still need to be sourced from further afield. This is where companies such as Dyson might have a role to play, suggested Make UK, helping to ensure supplies of semiconductor chips and other parts that would be too complex to make locally.\n\"It takes us a matter of weeks to scale up a factory to assemble something but sometimes the lead time on these components can be months,\" said Mr Phipson. \"So making sure that that point is covered off first, which is the priority, is really important.\"\nA spokeswoman for Dyson said it was already \"working with other companies to see if we can provide a rapid solution\".\nIt typically takes two to three years to develop and launch a ventilator. So convincing the industry's big players - such as General Electric and Philips - to let their products be made locally under licence is the likely plan of action.\nHowever, there would still be other hurdles to overcome. Abingdon-based Penlon already makes a bulkier type of ventilator used during anaesthesia. Its marketing chief, Craig Thompson, warned bureaucracy may be the biggest challenge of all.\n\"Ventilators are less sophisticated than things like smartphones and Xboxes,\" he said. \"This is not a technical challenge but a regulatory compliance one.\"\nEven if a ventilator used an existing design, he said, it still needed to undergo rigorous testing if made at a new site. \nAnd following that, there was usually a long wait for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to sign off the product.\nUnder normal circumstances, all this typically takes a year.\n\"The purpose of the process is to make sure that the device is effective and safe, and it takes a long time,\" Mr Thompson said.\nAnd even an expedited procedure would probably still take too long.\n\"The NHS is looking for a solution for this crisis in the next six to eight weeks,\" he said. \"The only way you can make that requirement would be to source them from existing factories, so definitely not from the UK.\"\nMake UK was more optimistic and suggested such a regulatory impasse could be overcome if there was enough political pressure. But it too warned making the kinds of numbers of ventilators the NHS needed may not be possible in the timescale desired.\n\"You could end up with some components taking 20 weeks to deliver,\" said Mr Phipson. \"We need to go through the detail and work out what is possible. We should have a clearer picture by the end of the week.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/73B2/production/_111281692_10e22bbb-cf57-4851-a47d-a307dbc49de5.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51914722": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51914722", "title": "Coronavirus: Robots use light beams to zap hospital viruses", "published": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 00:05:14 GMT", "summary": "Demand has surged for robots equipped with powerful ultraviolet lights that can kill viruses.", "story": "\"Please leave the room, close the door and start a disinfection,\" says a voice from the robot.\n\"It says it in Chinese as well now,\" Simon Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, tells me as he demonstrates the machine.\nThrough a glass window we watch as the self-driving machine navigates a mock-hospital room, where it kills microbes with a zap of ultraviolet light.\n\"We had been growing the business at quite a high pace - but the coronavirus has kind of rocketed the demand,\" says chief executive, Per Juul Nielsen.\nHe says \"truckloads\" of robots have been shipped to China, in particular Wuhan. Sales elsewhere in Asia, and Europe are also up.\n\"Italy has been showing a very strong demand,\" adds Mr Nielsen. \"They really are in a desperate situation. Of course, we want to help them.\"\nProduction has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark's third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub.\nGlowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can't multiply.\nIt's also hazardous to humans, so we wait outside. The job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there's a smell, much like burned hair.\n\"There are a lot of problematic organisms that give rise to infections,\" explains Prof Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology, at the University of Southern Denmark, which helped develop the robot.\n\"If you apply a proper dose of ultraviolet light in a proper period of time, then you can be pretty sure that you get rid of your organism.\"\nHe adds: \"This type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\"\nThe robot was launched in early 2019, following six years of collaboration between parent firm, Blue Ocean Robotics and Odense University Hospital where Prof Kolmos has overseen infection control.\nCosting $67,000 (\u00a353,370) each, the robot was designed to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) which can be costly to treat and cause loss of life.\nWhile there's been no specific testing to prove the robot's effectiveness against coronavirus, Mr Nielsen is confident it works.\n\"Coronavirus is very similar to other viruses like Mers and Sars. And we know that they are being killed by UV-C light,\" he says.\nDr Lena Ciric, an associate professor at University College London and expert on molecular biology, agrees that UV disinfection robots can help fight coronavirus. \nDisinfection robots are no \"silver bullet\", says Dr Ciric. But she adds: \"These [machines] provide an extra line of defence.\"\n\"We're in the run up to having a lot of coronavirus patients in the various hospitals. I think it's wise to be on top of the cleaning regimes\u2026 from an infection control point of view. \"\nTo be fully effective, UV needs to fall directly on a surface. If lightwaves are blocked by dirt or obstacles, such shadow areas won't be disinfected. Therefore manual cleaning is needed first. \nUV light has been used for decades in water and air purification, and used in laboratories.\nBut combining them with autonomous robots is a recent development.\nAmerican firm Xenex has LightStrike, which has to be manually put in place, and delivers high-intensity UV light from a U-shaped bulb.\nThe company has seen a surge in orders from Italy, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.\nXenex says numerous studies show that it's effective at reducing hospital-acquired infections and combating so-called superbugs. In 2014, one Texan hospital used it in the clean-up after an Ebola case.\nMore than 500 healthcare facilities, mostly in the US, have the machine. In California and Nebraska, it has already been put to use sanitising hospital rooms where coronavirus patients received treatment, the manufacturer says.\nIn China, where the outbreak began, there has been an adoption of new technology to help fight the disease.\nThe nation is already the highest spender on drones and robotics systems, according to a report from global research firm IDC.\nLeon Xiao, Senior Research Manager at IDC China says robots have been used for a range of tasks, primarily disinfection, deliveries of drugs, medical devices and waste removal, and temperature-checking.More Technology of Business'I think this is a breakthrough for greater use of robotics both for hospitals and other public places,\" says Mr Xiao. However space in hospitals to deploy robots and acceptance by staff are challenges, he says.\nThe coronavirus has spurred home-grown Chinese robotics companies to innovate.\nShenzhen-based YouiBot was already making autonomous robots, and quickly adapted its technology to make a disinfection device.\n\"We're trying to do something [to help], like every one here in China,\" says YouiBot's Keyman Guan.\nThe startup adapted its existing robotic base and software, adding thermal cameras and UV-C emitting bulbs.\n\"For us technically, [it's] not as difficult as you imagine\u2026 actually it's just like Lego,\" says Mr Guan.\nIt has supplied factories, offices and an airport, and a hospital in Wuhan. \"It's running right now in the luggage hall\u2026 checking body temperature in the day, and it goes virus killing during the night,\" he says. However the robot's efficacy hasn't yet been evaluated.\nMeanwhile plant closures and other restrictions to curb coronavirus, have hampered getting parts. \"The lack of one single component, [and] we cannot build a thing,\" adds Mr Guan, though he notes things have improved in the last couple of weeks.\n\"There are not many good things to say about epidemics,\" says Professor Kolmus, but it has forced industry \"to find new solutions\".\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14DA8/production/_111361458_w-gbffgqs9cm55hsomsgqa_thumb_11f0.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293675": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293675", "title": "Reducing brain damage in sport without losing the thrills", "published": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:27 GMT", "summary": "Sports like NFL and rugby are taking head injuries much more seriously and employing technology to help.", "story": "When Olympic gold medallist Shona McCallin was hit on the side of her head by a seemingly innocuous shoulder challenge, she suffered what was originally thought to be a concussion.\nHowever, headaches and other symptoms would not go away and brain scans revealed damage to her vestibular system - the part of the brain responsible for processing movement and motion.\nIt was seventeen months before she was able to play competitively again, but she made it back into the Great Britain hockey team.\n\"You know, unfortunately, injuries in sport and outside sport are a part of life,\" she says.\nFrom football to F1, professional sport has become more aware of the impact it has on the brains of athletes. \nThe US National Football League (NFL) has acknowledged that it concealed the dangers of concussion from players, leading to a settlement with ex-players that is expected to cost the NFL more than $1bn (\u00a3800m) over a 65-year period.\nBut damage to the brain is difficult to manage because it's difficult to measure. Often the effects are not felt until decades after players retire. So here is where new technology might help.\n\"In the NFL, they've put strain gauges into helmets to see what impacts are sustained - and they've been able to see the high amount of g-force exerted onto the helmet when two big players collide at speed,\" says Mr Ian Sabin, a consultant neurosurgeon from the Wellington Hospital in London who has worked with various sporting bodies, including the NFL.\nTo help assess the impact of those collisions, the NFL, which runs American football, has entered a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe organisations are working together on a digital platform that is fed by huge data inputs - including video analysis and sensor data from helmets.\nThe idea is to be able to create a digital representation of a player in a virtual on-field environment. The NFL can then simulate changes in the environment to see what would improve the safety of players.\nThe NFL makes the data available to firms that make helmets, and it says this has enabled improvements in one year that had previously taken a decade.\nIt has also launched a $3m helmet challenge for companies to design better helmets.\nThe platform could also be used in other sports such as soccer. \nThis is where companies like ANSYS are pitching for business. It provides simulation technology to check there are no design flaws when creating a helmet for sports. \n\"We can create a computer model of your brain. As the geometry of the brain is so complex, we are using medical imaging and transforming that into a 3D model,\" Thierry Marchal, global industry director at ANSYS, explains.\nThen the organisation can test and quantify the impact of certain actions, as well as validating these models with trained clinicians to ensure that the computer model represents and predicts accurately what's happening in a player's head. \n\"If there's some damage to a virtual player's head you can change a component such as the material to see if it will reduce the impact. Eventually we'll be able to have a helmet customised for specific athletes,\" he says.\nOther technologies are being used for rehabilitation. For example, McLaren Racing uses MindMaze technology inside the helmets of F1 racing drivers to provide more accurate neurological data to improve diagnosis and treatments of brain injuries. \nDespite the promise of these new technologies, Mr Sabin emphasises that there is still not a reliable imaging test that can either confirm a concussion, or tell the athlete whether they should stop playing their sport.\nHaving an extensive data set, such as the one NFL is putting together, could provide insight that hadn't been possible before, suggests Dr Willie Stewart. He is the consultant neuropathologist who led the study commissioned by the Football Association (FA) and the Professional Footballer's Association into the link between neurodegenerative diseases and ex-football players.\n\"We might consider something that hadn't been thought of before - it might be through using GPS tracking when players are accelerating, and how the brain functioning changes during that,\" he says. \nAlthough technology is advancing at pace, it will take time to use these to prevent and reduce concussions and impacts to the head in sport.\nIn the meantime, sports bodies are taking action. More Technology of Business, the FA, Scottish FA and Irish FA, advised that there should be no heading in training for primary school children, or under-11 teams and below.\nThere are also new rules for age ranges up until 18, with headers being kept a \"low priority\" and gradually becoming more frequent in training until the age of 16.\nWhile much worthy research and development is going on, sports are often operating under financial pressure.\nWill Carling, who captained England to three Grand Slams in the 1990s, says rugby union authorities are taking safety more seriously, but perhaps the biggest contribution to safety would be to play fewer games.\n\"I think sometimes we are still mistaking more games, for more money, for more profile, and we are abdicating a little bit of responsibility about player welfare.\n\"Exactly how much can the players at the very top of the game take? How much can their bodies and their minds actually sustain?\"\nProfessional athletes like Ms McCallin have to accept the risks of their sport.\n\"For me, the benefits of sport, both on a spiritual, mental and emotional capacity really do outweigh the potential risks of injury,\" she says.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6673/production/_110872262_shona.g.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676", "title": "Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?", "published": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:13:28 GMT", "summary": "Clever designs are trying to tackle queues for female loos, but will the innovations catch on?", "story": "A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group. \nBefore the show, they headed to the toilets. \"I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,\" she recalls.

It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,\" says the French entrepreneur.\nEven newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.\nCopenhagen-based architects, Gina P\u00e9rier and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.  \n\"It's just insanely more efficient,\" says Ms P\u00e9rier, 25.  \nThe idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival.  \"I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,\" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. \"There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.\"\nAccording to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate. \nThe team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.\nGetting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. \"We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,\" she tells me. \nLapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.\nMs P\u00e9rier says Lapee is also targeting, \"public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.\"\nThe start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year. \nThey're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.\nOther urinal products have launched with varying success.\nPerhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up. \nSam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.\n\"The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,\" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further. \nMr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.\nGail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.\n\"It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,\" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.\n\"Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.\"\nWomen typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned. \n\"We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,\" Ms Ramster says.\n\"Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.\"\nResearchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times. \nBut the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women. \n\"For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,\" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. \"This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].\" \nIt could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them. \n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/183E2/production/_110689299_nathaliedesisnards-creditlavoixdunord.jpg"}}, "sport": {"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52057533": {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52057533", "title": "Mikel Arteta: Arsenal manager on coronavirus recovery", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 20:04:56 GMT", "summary": "People should be \"emotionally more open\" after the coronavirus pandemic, says Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta following his recovery from the illness.", "story": "People should be \"emotionally more open\" after the coronavirus pandemic, says Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta following his recovery.\nArteta, 38, tested positive for the virus on 12 March but has since recovered after self-isolating.\n\"We are in a world here where everything is social media, everything is a WhatsApp text,\" the Spaniard said.\n\"But how important is touching each other, feeling each other and hugging each other?\n\"I miss that with a lot of the people I love.\n\"We have to be emotionally more open.

It also won Ralph an Ivor Novello award for best song and continues to feature in folk music's \"best of\" playlists.\nRalph is a neighbour and also one of the kindest men I know. Since I was a teenager I have loved his bittersweet songs of the heart and acute social observation.\nLike most of the population, Ralph, aged 75, is observing the lockdown in his London home. As an avid follower of news he watched, appalled, as the Covid-19 crisis swept the world. \n\"This is of biblical proportions, this catastrophe,\" he told me. \"And each day that goes by there is the realisation that this is no dress rehearsal, this is actually going on right now and there is nothing we can do about it, except try and follow the basic rules.\"\nBorn into a working class family in Croydon, south London, at the end of World War Two, Ralph left home and joined the army aged 15. His social conscience was forged in a post-war world circumscribed by poverty. It is not a pose.\nWith its focus on the homeless and imagery of lonely figures moving through an uncaring world, Streets of London resonates powerfully now as thousands of rough sleepers across Britain are seeking a place of safety. \nChatting on the phone, I told Ralph I had been filming with homeless people in London and of how they were searching for a safe place to self isolate.\nI spoke of a young woman called Blue, aged 29, who I'd met living under a railway bridge and how fearful she was that she would be arrested and put into isolation. \n\"What would you write now if there was to be another verse to the song?\" I asked.\nChanging the song was something he'd always resisted, he said. It was written when he was 22 and belonged to a particular time. But this was an extraordinary moment in history. \"Give me a chance to think and try and write something.\"\nThis new verse was the moving result:\nRalph is an optimist. In recent daily encounters he has detected a new mood of community.\nIn his area of west London, it has manifested itself in warmer greetings and observing the rules of social distancing. He is aware of the paradox that what pushes us physically apart might bring us closer.\n\"I've got a little dog and took her for a walk yesterday. And I noticed people as they're getting closer to each other they just sort of smile and move apart and I thought, 'Ah the message is going in at last. Yes I think we're all going to be different after this.'\"  \nLike his musical colleagues, Ralph is unable to perform in front of crowds for as long as Covid-19 remains a major public health hazard.\nBut his great song - with its new verse - is a powerful appeal to our better natures in these fearful times.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p087q08f.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52048588": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52048588", "title": "Courteney Cox's Friends are there for her in coronavirus isolation", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 11:51:16 GMT", "summary": "\"People love the show so much, I decided to binge watch Friends... it's really good!\"", "story": "Actress Courteney Cox has found her own way to get through self-isolation during the coronavirus pandemic - binge-watching Friends.\nCox told TV host Jimmy Kimmel she remembered very little about the hit sitcom in which she played Monica for a decade.\n\"People love the show so much, I decided to binge watch Friends... it's really good!\" she said via video link.\n\"I don't remember even being on the show, I have such a bad memory.\"\nShe added: \"I remember obviously loving everybody there and having fun and I remember certain times of my life I was there, but I don't remember episodes.\"\nThe hugely successful show notched up 236 instalments and has enjoyed a recent resurgence among a new generation on Netflix.\nCox was chatting with Kimmel on his YouTube Quarantine Minilogue, which he began after his late-night talk show was taken off air as a result of the pandemic. \nEnd of Youtube post  by Jimmy Kimmel Live\nThe actress said she had bought the entire Friends box set on Amazon Prime after it was taken off Netflix in the US in anticipation of the HBO Max streaming service launching in May. \nAll 10 series are still available on Netflix in the UK and episodes also run on Channel 5 and Comedy Central.\nDue to her foggy recollection, Cox said she gets stressed out when people ask her to answer questions about Friends.\nThat was a red rag to a bull for Kimmel, who decided to test her knowledge in a head-to-head with his cousin, a huge fan of the show.\nDespite the questions all being Monica-related, Cox lost 5-0.\nQuestions she did not know the answers to included who Monica shared her first kiss with, and who peed on her leg in season four episode The One With The Jellyfish.\nCox used her appearance on Kimmel's stream to ask viewers to make a donation to the Meals On Wheels charity.\nShe also confirmed that filming for the long-awaited Friends reunion special, which was announced in February, has been postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.\nCox said she and former co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer had been supposed to film the programme on Monday and Tuesday.\nThe unscripted special will see the cast reminiscing about their time on the series - if they can remember it.\nThe special is expected to be available on HBO Max, but no firm date has been given.\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/143A4/production/_99425828_friends_getty.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51855372": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51855372", "title": "Friday Night Dinner: Why food fights and mayhem have become a TV treat", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 02:22:46 GMT", "summary": "The stars of Channel 4's anarchic sitcom open up about the shenanigans on and off-screen.", "story": "At a time when many of us are having to stay away from our family, it's business as usual round at the Goodmans - in other words, collective chaos.\nIf you're unfamiliar with this foursome, they're the fictional stars of Channel 4's Friday Night Dinner - an anarchic sitcom where the degree of farce borders on the insane.\nAs the title suggests, the set-up is in theory benign, cosy even. A secular Jewish household - mum, dad and their two grown-up sons - come together each week in the family home to mark the start of the Sabbath. \nSoup, chicken and \"crimble\" crumble are always on the menu and yet the Goodmans never get to eat. \nMayhem ensues within minutes of the brothers stepping through the front door. It starts with their compulsive pranking of each other. But as the evening goes on, a series of random surreal events leads to family meltdown - and dinner ruined.\nThe show, which starts its sixth series this week, is the creation of Robert Popper, whose previous credits include Peep Show, South Park and The Inbetweeners.\nPopper, who is Jewish, had his Eureka! moment for a comedy which played with the oddities of family dynamics, particularly those in a Jewish family, while musing in the bath. \n\"I decided I wanted to do a show about a family and the feeling you get that when you go home you revert to being kids again,\" he says.\n\"I used to go home on Friday evening, which is like the Sunday lunch equivalent, and my brother and I became like children again.\n\"And, whenever I'd seen Jewish comedy or scenes, they seemed overdone or overly emotional, with a violin playing and soft focus on the candles so I wanted to do something where those elements were just a backdrop.\n\"But the intensity of the Goodmans and how they are very argumentative and everyone knows everyone's business - that's all very recognisably Jewish.\"\nThose Goodmans are Tamsin Greig, as mum Jackie, Paul Ritter is dad Martin, elder son Adam is Simon Bird, with Tom Rosenthal as his sibling Jonny.\nSitting sardine-like on a sofa, they seem relaxed and in good spirits - unlike their characters in the comedy, which has for nine years followed its own particular formula. \nMum's desperately trying to keep control; characteristically shirtless dad - the family oddity - has a new weird obsession; strange neighbour Jim unfailingly turns up at the door with his dog and Jonny's gags always get the better of Adam.\nAs Bird and Rosenthal jostle somewhat on the sofa you might assume they had adopted their own pattern of brotherly rivalry in real life.\n\"Well, he's just tipped a box of popcorn on my head. But I've already got three siblings so I'm really over them and don't need another,\" says Bird.\n\"Between takes we do try to chuck grapes into each other's mouths. The action and the off-camera bits are really quite similar,\" adds Rosenthal.\nThough the essential ingredients of the show haven't altered, the extremes to which the farce goes has been ramped up over the years.\nThe first episode in the new series doesn't disappoint in this regard, featuring as it does fire and copious excrement.\nPopper admits his enjoyment at \"pushing things to the limit and making each Friday awful for the family\", which habitually involves swearing - and violence.\n\"Jackie is considerably more violent in this series and there's a greater intensity,\" says Greig.\n\"It's not right and it's not good but Robert said, 'it's just funny'.\"\nShe recalls hitting Ritter with a stick, he adds \"and fist punch\", while Rosenthal displays a bruise and recounts how Bird, who is \"a lot stronger than he looks\" once caused the ligaments \"to pop out in my leg - which was apparently very harrowing for everyone else\".\nAnd a lot of food gets thrown leading to Jackie (and Greig) despairing over the carpet.\n\"I worry about the waste because the carpet gets trashed,\" she says. \"But I also find food moving in an inappropriate way very funny.\"\nTV critics seem to appreciate the gags. Mark Lawson in the Guardian said: \"The pleasure... is in Popper's expert escalation of the desperation and social embarrassment that are the engines of farce. The plots become twisted chains of deceit, miscomprehension and blackmail.\" While Veroncia Lee from the Arts Desk, called the show a \"deliciously daft comedy,\" adding: \"There's nothing groundbreaking or edgy about Friday Night Dinner, but like a favourite meal it always satisfies, even if it does repeat.\"\nFor all the silliness, the show is not always an easy ride for the actors, says Greig.\n\"We're stuck in this house and it feels like a Jewish Big Brother because you can't leave and you can't go outside until it's dark so as not to disturb the neighbours.\n\"It's filmed in winter so if you're outside and the Beast from the East comes, you think: 'I really hope someone is finding this funny' - the experience is often not.\"\nAnd for guest characters - which this series includes Miranda actress Sally Phillips - it's also \"quite stressful,\" she adds, especially as they don't know the territorial protocol over the Green Room's seating.\n\"If someone is on my sofa, I have to pretend to be OK with it but I'm not a very good actor,\" adds Bird.\nSadly the regular visiting character of Jackie's kindly mum will no longer be in the show following the death of the \"brilliant\" and \"genius\" (Greig's assessment) actress Frances Cuka.\nPopper says it would \"be a bit crass\" to have a funeral in the show but an onscreen tribute will go up as the final episode ends.\nAnother thing Popper doesn't feel the show should address is anti-Semitic sentiment, which has been increasingly debated in the UK due to accusations that it's a \n\"My intention was never to bring any Jewish issues into the show, I wanted it to be silly and funny,\" he says. \"But I did touch on it in the last series (when Jim's girlfriend made an anti-Semitic comment) because I thought I might as well do it once.\"\nThe lack of political comment is among the attractions of the show, which, says Popper, has an increasingly younger audience.\nAnd despite the name calling and often gross scenarios, it's fast become a family watch .\nIt's this \"that was appealing when we started all those years ago,\" says Rosenthal.\nGreig adds: \"What's captured the imagination is the notion of coming home and that feeling that there is always a place to go. That's interesting to watch and experience.\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/18E5/production/_111237360_fnd_cut_six.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52048868": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52048868", "title": "Coronavirus: Isle of Wight and Download Festivals axed", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:26:42 GMT", "summary": "Organisers of both events are looking to give refunds or let people keep tickets for next year.", "story": "The Isle of Wight and Download have become the latest music festivals to be cancelled due to the coronavirus.\nDuran Duran and Lionel Richie were due to appear alongside Supergrass and Kaiser Chiefs at Seaclose Park, Newport on the Isle of Wight.\nAt Download, Kiss, Iron Maiden and System of a Down were the headliners due at Donington Park.\nBoth festivals had been set to take place in mid-June.\nOrganisers of both events are looking to give those who have already bought tickets refunds or the option to carry their tickets forward to next year's event.\nFor the Isle of Wight, fans who had already bought ferry of hovercraft travel were being advised to contact Red Funnel, Wightlink or Hovertravel direct.\n\"We appreciate your patience whilst we've been working through this unprecedented situation.\n\"We'll be back stronger than ever in 2021 and we hope to see you all again next year\", organisers said in a statement.\nIsle of Wight's council leader, Dave Stewart, said: \"I understand the disappointment this will bring to many people and the impact on businesses both on the Island and beyond.\n\"I appreciate how hard it will have been to have made this decision, and I want to thank the festival organisers for making the sensible choice.\"\nOn the festival website, a statement from the Download organisers said: \"This decision hasn't been taken lightly and we're beyond disappointed.

So producers were able to make him appear on a vertical screen propped up on the BBC One sofa next to Jones.\n\"Self-isolation has become a sudden and confusing reality for households across the country, so it made perfect sense for us to reflect Matt Baker's experiences of that live on air,\" The One Show's editor Rob Unsworth tells BBC News.\n\"Our initial reaction had been to just check in with him briefly on his first day at home, but it became clear as we all discussed it that a more engaging and uplifting treatment would be to continue to involve him throughout the programme, effectively co-presenting as normal, but from his own sofa rather than the one in the studio. \n\"Inevitably that produced challenges, but Matt enthusiastically embraced the idea. Once we were on air, he was working without autocue, delivering links in his own style based on a draft script we'd emailed.\"\nHe adds: \"The intention was to retain the natural interaction we'd typically have when he and Alex Jones are sitting next to each other - which is no mean feat when there's a slight delay and the sound and wi-fi signal can be variable.\"\nThe One Show is going to become one of the BBC's major sources of information and advice over the coming months, and the viewing figures have increased dramatically this week.\nWednesday's episode attracted an audience of 5.4 million, significantly higher than the show's 3.1 million average.\nMeanwhile, Susanna Reid appeared from home on Good Morning Britain and, along with her studio-based co-hosts Piers Morgan and Charlotte Hawkins, was able to put questions to guests such as Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay.\nOn Loose Women, Gloria Hunniford, who as a 79-year-old is in an at-risk group, dialled in from home and told her fellow panellists: \"I'm feeling absolutely fine but things all changed for me last Sunday when more and more info came out.\n\"I am pre-diabetic, so when I listened to all the research I thought I had to take action.\"\nBroadcasting from home at short notice is often easier on the radio, as some presenters store emergency broadcast kit.\nNick Robinson hosted Radio 4's Today programme from his basement on Thursday, and was one of \nLarge red cushions to absorb the echo could be seen in the picture he tweeted, as well as a laptop screen showing the exact time and, perhaps most importantly, a plate of toast.\nChris Evans wasn't so much working from home as working from boat on Thursday, as he presented his Virgin Radio breakfast show on the water.\nSeveral presenters will have to be careful their pets don't accidentally press the wrong buttons. \n enjoyed a wander round his home set-up before his talkRADIO show, while \n was a special guest for his LBC slot.\nRob Bonnet, sport presenter for the Today programme, is a man particularly concerned with good quality audio.

They wouldn't normally expect that, they'd have to get it themselves. That was the downside,\" she says.\n\"But the upside was that within minutes after coming off air we were all sitting round the table eating, and the dog jumped up on my lap.\"\nThere was one other major perk to working from home, Montague points out. \"There's much better coffee here than at the BBC.\"\nseveral presenters to post pictures of their home studios.\nIain Lee's cats\nIain Dale's dog\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51979902": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51979902", "title": "How the Pet Shop Boys accidentally made the best tour diary in pop history", "published": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:19:24 GMT", "summary": "How the Pet Shop Boys inadvertently ended up with the best tour diary in pop history.", "story": "Pop music, Brian Eno once said, isn't just about making music in the traditional sense of the word.\nInstead, it's about \"the creation of a new, imaginary world, which beckons the listener to join it\".\nFor the last 39 years, the Pet Shop Boys have been doing exactly that, making anthemic dance music that wryly scrutinises culture, politics, personal relationships and the nature of pop itself. \nOn stage, they've created their own universe where theatre meets pop - pushing the boundaries of what a live show can achieve. And, along the way, they stumbled into one of the best biographies in pop history.\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe met in a Chelsea electronics shop, where a chance conversation about music and synthesisers started a lifelong friendship and musical partnership.\nFour years later, in 1985, they scored their first number one - West End Girls, a walking pace disco track about the drama and excitement of late night Soho, where cultures meet and meld and clash surrounded by \"faces on posters\" and the ever-present threat of sex or violence - or both.\nFrom the beginning, a sense of mystery surrounded the band. They weren't showy or glamorous like normal pop stars. Tennant wasn't a natural vocalist. On Top of the Pops, they barely moved.\nNo-one knew quite what to make of them, even as they built up an enviable discography of perfect pop singles. Hovering in the air was the eternal question: Was this all an ironic prank?\nThe assumption rankled the band, as journalist Chris Heath discovered when he tagged along on their first ever tour.\n\"Yes, I'm supposed to be the irony merchant,\" scoffed Tennant, who maintained, \"most of what we do is meant totally sincerely\".\n\"When we started out we got into hi-energy and hip-hop music and we liked the power and the rawness and the excitement of it. And we've always tried to make records that had the same delirium and excitement, or a very strong feeling about them.\n\"But, \" he added dolefully, \"my voice cannot sound 'up' when I sing. I literally cannot do it.\"\nThis interview was captured in Heath's book - Pet Shop Boys, Literally - a phenomenal piece of observational journalism, cataloguing the group's first, tentative venture onto the stage in 1989.\nThey'd planned and cancelled two previous tours, in 1986 and 1987, discovering that their ambitions for a theatrical live show weren't compatible with the economics of a pop concert.\nIt was a generous offer from a Japanese promoter that finally got them on the road but, even then, they weren't convinced of the wisdom of playing night after night to actual fans.\n\"Rock shows are really embarrassing. The audience can be embarrassing and the performers I find cringeworthy,\" Lowe postulates as they set of for Asia.\nLater, at a press conference to promote their shows in Hong Kong, Lowe tells the media: \"We're not a live band, really.\"\nHeath's book offers unprecedented access to the band. He's there in hotel rooms and on tour busses, he dances with them at Japanese discos and takes a long walk with Tennant in the countryside. There are no drugs and no sex (except when they stumble across a couple in flagrante on a hillside).\nInstead, it's a frank and revealing peek behind the curtain.\nTennant and Lowe are simultaneously bristling with self-confidence and racked with insecurities, not least because the tour hasn't sold out in the UK.\nThey are also fantastically catty - slagging off Adam Ant, Piers Morgan, bobble hats, their tour promoter, and even their fans  - while getting giddily excited that Jason Donovan might come to one of their shows (he doesn't).\nWhile they're wary of rock clich\u00e9, Heath doesn't spare them when things go a bit Spinal Tap.\nBefore their first concert, Lowe flies into a rage because a backdrop curtain that should be black is, in fact, brown. When his mother comes to see them play in the UK, her first comment isn't about the music but his haircut: \"I didn't know you'd become a Buddhist\".\nThroughout the book, Tennant slowly starts to enjoy himself, finding that being a rock star sometimes \n all its cracked up to be.\n\"I have an obsession with teenage hysteria and just to find myself at the centre of it, I just find quite thrilling,\" he observes.\nBut there's mock horror when the singer shouts \"arigato\", the Japanese word for thank you, at the end of one of the shows.\n\"I thought 'How shameless,'\" Lowe tells Heath. \"I bowed my head in shame and thought, 'he's a tart'\".\nNo wonder that, when the band first read the manuscript in 1990, they declared themselves to be \"more or less horrified\".\nSadly the book, and its 1993 sequel Pet Shop Boys vs America, have long been out of print... until earlier this week, when they were republished by Penguin books.\n\"They've been in a weird netherworld,\" says Heath on the phone from the US. \"Perversely, there's something quite nice about having these books that are unavailable and that people talk about like some mystery... But I'd rather people were reading them.\"\nInterestingly, the books were initially written off by reviewers who were sniffy about Heath's decision to delve into the minutiae of touring life, feeling it was all surface and no depth.\nThe Face's Dave Haslam said Literally \"isn't a book, it's a list\" adding: \"I'd have preferred a book that told a few truths, or even a few lies.\"\nBut that misses the point, says Heath.\nThe author - who, like Tennant, started his writing career at Smash Hits - believed there was value in close-up reporting, without having to explicitly state a grand intellectual thesis.\n\"I always thought I was going to be able to tell a much deeper story [through] an incredible accumulation of detail,\" he explains.\n\"No-one reads a novel and says, 'It's just a load of stuff that happens,' because they go in thinking there's a greater purpose to all this; that all of this stuff is being juxtaposed to do something greater than just telling us a series of events or a series of conversations.\n\"Any great non-fiction book should be that - but somehow that wasn't the way that people went into a book about pop music.\"\nIn the intervening years, though, the book's reputation has grown; and others have adopted Heath's style of reportage - most notably Bill Flanagan, who spent two years on U2's Zoo TV tour for the similarly-revelatory U2 At The End Of The World.\nThe question remains, though: How did Heath get this unprecedented access?\n\"There's not an incredibly simple answer,\" he says. \"People took photographers on tour as a standard thing in the 80s and I think they thought, 'Why don't we take a journalist?'\n\"I was friendly with them, and I'd written about them a bit, but I don't think they had thought about the end result, particularly.\"\nIn fact, discussions about the nature of the book form a recurring part of the narrative. \n\"This can never come out,\" exclaims Tennant at one juncture, but surprisingly little was expunged from the record.\n\"Famously, the thing that got cut out of these books is most of when they swear - but that's totally openly declared,\" insists Heath.\n\"People imagine there's a whole other unexpurgated version of it - but why would you imagine that in a book that's already way more truthful and revealing than you'd normally expect?\"\nDespite their horror at the original manuscript (\"We're horrible, aren't we?\" said Lowe after reading it for the first time) the band were sufficiently happy to ask Heath back on the road for their first US tour a couple of years later.\nIt came at an interesting point for the duo. Their fifth album, Behaviour, had been critically-acclaimed, but failed to scale the chart peaks of their previous work. Their new single, a kitsch cover of U2's Where The Streets Have No Name, wasn't getting the expected radio play, meaning they were embarking on an ambitious tour, in a country that hadn't been their strongest market, from an uncertain base.\nIt didn't help that the first night had to be cancelled due to sound problems. Then Lowe caused a minor diplomatic incident by walking off stage during a performance on Jay Leno's late night chat show, furious that the camera was focusing solely on Tennant and the backing singers.\nThe band spend large portions of the tour fretting about their future. Heath captures one typical exchange backstage at Los Angeles' Universal Ampitheater.\n\"We've gone off the boil with the public,\" sighs Neil.\n\"It's all down to the album not being as good,\" says Chris.\n\"I think we've lost some of the teenage audience,\" digresses Neil\n\"I think we've got to write some simpler, hooky music,\" says Chris.\n\"Yeah,\" says Neil. \"That's what I think.\"\n\"It was tough,\" says Heath, \"touring America with a record that wasn't on fire, and with this incredibly complicated, expensive show - but I don't remember a huge despondency.\n\"My more glib memory is that, pretty much always, they've been a mixture of a complete exuberance and [thinking] 'Oh it's all over, let's not bother.'\"\nUltimately, the Pet Shop Boys' Performance tour was broadly a success. \nThe US press welcomed the high-concept, theatrical stage show as a revolution in stagecraft - the San Francisco Examiner called it \"more performance art than rock concert\" while the New York Daily News compared it to a Met Opera production of Satyricon.\nAnd, of course, Pet Shop Boys did go back and write some \"simpler, hooky music\". Their next album, 1993's Very, contained the hit singles Can You Forgive Her and Go West, and remains their biggest-seller.\nEnd of Youtube post  by PetShopBoys Parlophone\nBut while Heath's second book has a somewhat traditional \"triumph-over-adversity\" narrative arc, Heath says that's just a happy accident.\n\"I've written other books where I've had pressure from the publisher to have some sort of 'moment' at the point where the book ends,\" he says.\n\"And I'm not shy of expressing larger themes and showing powerful arcs of things changing; but lives don't end just because the book ends.\"\nHeath went on to write for Rolling Stone and GQ -  where Paul McCartney told him he'd envisioned DNA before DNA was discovered while tripping on acid in the 1960s. He also wrote two painfully honest books with Robbie Williams, based on a similarly-unprecedented level of access.\nThe key to obtaining such revelatory interviews, he says, is just to be interested in people. And, occasionally, to break with social conventions.\n\"I always think,\" he says, \"one of the hardest questions to ask, but one of the best questions you can ask is the one I'm about to say...\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026  \n\"That was it.\"\n\"It's really uncomfortable doing it. You have to deliberately force something that all your instincts are telling you, as a polite human bring, not to do.\n\"But very often people have more to say, and you've just got to give them space.\"\nFacebook\n@BBCNewsEnts\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51979285": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51979285", "title": "Coronavirus: 9

in the USA - a directory of writers, actors and producers alleged to be communists or communist sympathisers. The red scare ended many careers. Now 102, actress Marsha Hunt is almost the last person still alive named in the book.\nMarsha Hunt never wanted to do anything except act. Born in 1917, she grew up in New York City and remembers going to the theatre with her father when she was five.\n\"It was a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta - probably HMS Pinafore. I turned to my dad and I said I'm going to do that. After that if there was a play I was always in it,\" she says.\nHunt was in her late teens when she went to Hollywood looking for a film career. She found success quickly: her first film was The Virginia Judge in 1935.\nShe was constantly in work and seemed to have a long career ahead of her - although few of her early films are familiar today. An exception is the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice with Laurence Olivier.\nShe still regrets a near miss with the classic Gone with the Wind. \"For about a weekend it appeared I'd been cast as Melanie, who's Scarlett O'Hara's cousin. Then an executive changed his mind and I lost the role. When I went to Hollywood I'd been warned I would have my heart broken and losing Melanie was that moment.\"\nBut before she was 30 Marsha Hunt had made more than 40 films. Producers valued her attractive and intelligent screen presence.\nIn 1945 she was asked to join the board of the Screen Actors Guild and for the first time her politics came under scrutiny.\n\"I was proud to be asked. To have a voice in what would affect all screen actors was dazzlingly important to me,\" she says. But Cold War tension was building with the Soviet Union and anyone suspected of left-wing sympathies was open to attack.\nHollywood, radio and TV came under suspicion. The political pressure came from HUAC - the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities.\nIn 1947, HUAC summoned 10 writers to Washington to testify. Each was asked if he was a communist and all ultimately went to prison for refusing to answer or to name other communists.\nMarsha's problems with the authorities may have begun when she joined the Committee for the First Amendment - a group of liberal actors who supported the Hollywood Ten. Among those who flew to Washington were Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly and John Huston. Also there were Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, married and the biggest stars Warner Bros had.\n\"We were a brigade to defend those who'd been blacklisted or were under suspicion,\" Hunt remembers. \"We were serious citizens trying to set Washington straight: we were not a bunch of Reds. We were headed by the Bogarts so we were a pretty spiffy team. \n\"We made our speeches and did a radio programme called Hollywood Fights Back and came home thinking we'd been patriots and had defended our profession. If there were some communists among us that was their business and not ours.\n\"I knew nothing about communism but I just thought that as it was a legal party other people had the right to join the darned thing if they wanted to. But it was a time of hysteria and all of us who spoke out against blacklists were punished in some way or other. There was a very strong right wing in the movie business.\"\nStars who'd supported the committee quickly came under huge pressure from studio bosses to recant and Humphrey Bogart declared that his support had been a mistake.\nHunt remembers that turnabout with sadness. \"I'm sorry to say but it can only be cowardice. That's a terrible word to use about the Bogarts but why else would they do that? We all went to Washington to defend other people's rights. It was a time of people really turning quite ugly.\"\nShe says it's hard to judge how far her career was damaged at first. But in 1950 her name and 150 others appeared in Red Channels, a 200-page book published as an adjunct to Counterattack - The Newsletter of Facts to Combat Communism. The book was subtitled: \"The report of communist influence in radio and television.\" Inclusion was enough to damage or in some cases terminate a career.\nThose named included composers Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland and Marc Blitzstein, actors Lee J Cobb and Jose Ferrer and the writers Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman. Today the only survivor apart from Hunt is Walter Bernstein, who's 100. (In 1976 Walter Bernstein wrote the film The Front about the blacklist era.)\nHunt insists that in 1950 she never even saw Red Channels. \"I guess I was a star but I was never sizzlingly hot as a Hollywood property for hire. But I certainly lost a lot of jobs as the blacklist tightened.\n\"We live, we proudly insist, in a free country. By that was meant, I was sure, that you were free to your opinions and actions if they didn't break any law. The anti-Reds were fighting Americans' freedoms. I didn't know the first thing about communism - never studied it, never learned about it. I must have known a few communists but I didn't care - that was their business, not mine.\"\nTo continue to work on screen her agent persuaded her to write out a statement of her beliefs. \"It was an anti-communist declaration and he said without it I would never clear my name. Gradually it changed things for me in Hollywood but my work and reputation never returned to how they were.\" \nHunt says she was never at the top of anyone's list of people to attack. \"But there were actors I worked with and liked who were or had been communists. I'd been seen in the company of so-and-so and that was enough.\n\"Suddenly to have the dirtiest word in the American language - communist - held against me was an outrage. And I had no way to end it or fight back.\" \nAfter 1950 screen credits were mainly limited to TV but she was happy to appear in George Bernard Shaw's play The Devil's Disciple on Broadway, where the power of the blacklist was less absolute. Other stage-work followed.\nBy the '60s she was working primarily for charitable and humanitarian causes although occasional screen credits continued. Though she largely disappeared from public view she was pleased when director Roger Memos made the documentary Marsha Hunt's Sweet Adversity, which is introducing her to the online generation.\n\"Many younger people know little about the Hollywood blacklist,\" she says. \"Sometimes I'm asked if it could ever happen again. I hope America learned from what happened all those years ago. But how can you ever be sure?\"\n", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FF43/production/_111374356_img_1318.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52050569": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52050569", "title": "Doctor Who fans unite with an online viewing", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:22:44 GMT", "summary": "Fans touched by the Doctor Who re-boot 15 years ago celebrate with a mass viewing of the first episode.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/B51B/production/_111436364_p087t9cl.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52044068": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52044068", "title": "Hit 70s song gets coronavirus rewrite", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:05:03 GMT", "summary": "Ralph McTell wrote The Streets of London over 50 years ago but now he\u2019s done something he\u2019s always previously refused.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/15061/production/_111431168_p087q08f.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51999522": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51999522", "title": "Coronavirus: Frozen birthday party saved by Zoom video chat app", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 00:10:09 GMT", "summary": "Thirty children took part in a virtual video chat celebration for a self-isolated four-year-old.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/065D/production/_111392610_p087cn30.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-51979042": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-51979042", "title": "Coronavirus: Back garden gigs to help with self-isolation", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:48:16 GMT", "summary": "Musicians in Sheffield are playing in their back gardens for free to raise community spirits.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/DC9F/production/_111397465_p0876b0b.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51969569": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51969569", "title": "Online festival celebrates arts affected by Covid-19", "published": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:01:56 GMT", "summary": "Playwright Nick Green launched the Social Distancing Festival to shine a spotlight on lost projects.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/8DE8/production/_111382363_p0879jmr.jpg"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51981856": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51981856", "title": "Turning SXSW disappointment into an online opportunity", "published": "Sat, 21 Mar 2020 00:02:13 GMT", "summary": "Musicians due to play on the British Embassy stage at SXSW in Texas have been offered a platform of a different kind.", "story": "", "pic": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/5E7B/production/_111378142_p0877bbv.jpg"}}}, "theguardian": {"Politics": {"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row", "title": "No 10 accused of putting 'Brexit over breathing' in Covid-19 ventilator row", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:25:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>Government clarifies position after critics accuse Boris Johnson of putting \u2018Brexit over breathing\u2019</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Downing Street has claimed it failed to take part in an EU scheme to source life-saving ventilators to treat coronavirus because it accidentally missed the deadline.</p><p>No 10 initially said it did not take part because the UK was \u201cno longer a member\u201d and was \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Downing Street has claimed it failed to take part in an EU scheme to source life-saving ventilators to treat coronavirus because it accidentally missed the deadline.\nNo 10 initially said it did not take part because the UK was \u201cno longer a member\u201d and was \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d.\nBut after critics accused \n of putting \u201cBrexit over breathing\u201d, a No 10 spokesman clarified that it had missed out because of an error and would consider participating in future. It is understood the UK claims not to have received an email from the EU asking it to participate.\nThe mix-up means the UK has missed out on benefiting from the collective buying power of the EU. The bloc is seeking to use its clout to source large numbers of ventilators and protective equipment.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cOwing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cAs the commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year.\n\u201cAs those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender, we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.\u201d\nThe UK has chosen to source ventilators from British manufacturers who have never made the products before. \n, the household appliance firm, said it had received an order for 10,000 machines.\nAsked why the UK was not taking part in the EU scheme, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman had earlier said: \u201cWe are no longer members of the EU.\u201d He stressed that the UK was \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d in this area.\nWhen asked whether it would be hard for people to understand this decision, particularly in light of the fact Johnson has called for international cooperation in the fight against coronavirus, the spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it is.\u201d\nMinisters have acknowledged the UK needs thousands more ventilators to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, adding to the 8,000 the \n already has. No 10 said on Thursday that thousands of additional ventilators had been ordered but it could not put a timescale on their arrival.\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWe would say we expect thousands of those to arrive in the coming weeks, and thousands more in the pipeline to arrive in the coming months.\u201d\nThe spokesman said Dyson would be paid for its ventilators only if they passed regulatory tests. He said there had been an \u201coverwhelming response\u201d from firms offering to make ventilators, and the government was now testing \u201cproof of concept\u201d with a number of suppliers. \u201cNew orders are all dependent on machines passing regulatory tests,\u201d he said.\nHowever, opposition figures said the UK should join the EU procurement scheme as well, in case it could source equipment faster.\nLayla Moran, a Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, said: \u201cI would do whatever it takes to get more life-saving equipment, and they need to take the same approach. It\u2019s a no-brainer we can help the NHS and save lives by working together with other countries.\u201d\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cWe raised this with ministers in the Commons earlier this week and did not receive a satisfactory response. With widespread concerns about our ventilator capacity and the urgent need to scale up that capacity, we should be cooperating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit.\u201d\nSeveral small suppliers of ventilators have said the government has not responded to their offers to make more.\nThe head of Direct Access, Steven Mifsud, \n he had sourced 5,000 ventilators and millions of face masks and personal protective equipment through partners in the United Arab Emirates. He said he registered the supply on the \u201cventilator challenge\u201d page of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy website, but after five days he had heard nothing and the supplies went elsewhere.\nHe was quoted as saying the only communication he had from the Department of \n was a \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cyou are in our system\u201d.\n\u201cTime is a luxury that we as a nation do not have,\u201d Mifsud said. \u201cThis virus does not wait for anyone and every second costs lives. I am incredibly frustrated with the British government and the current \n attitude.\u201d He said his partners in the UAE said they were getting responses from other countries within hours.\nAndrew Raynor, of the medical parts manufacturer MEC Medical, told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight that nothing happened when he contacted the government offering to make ventilators. \u201cThe government should have given funding to existing ventilator manufacturers and existing companies like us,\u201d he said.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff9a86c0381f7005e3571004dd34979d1418fd77/0_113_6192_3713/master/6192.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b30eef7193f051b11bf50db234e74b7"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/26/uk-coronavirus-live-news-updates-self-employed-rishi-sunakhospital-car-parking-charges-waived-for-nhs-staff-in-england": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/26/uk-coronavirus-live-news-updates-self-employed-rishi-sunakhospital-car-parking-charges-waived-for-nhs-staff-in-england", "title": "UK coronavirus live: Covid-19 death toll reaches 578 after biggest recorded daily rise \u2013 as it happened", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:51:43 GMT", "summary": "<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces new measures for self-employed; police get new powers to enforce lockdown - as it happened.

The reference to parity was taken as implying that they could get 80% of earnings up to \u00a32,500 a month, but because Johnson only talked of his \u201cdesire\u201d to achieve this, no one could be sure.

A set of boundary plans were voted down by opposition MPs in 2013.\nThere has been criticism in the past that MPs have vested interests in the boundaries of their constituency, as any redrawing of the map can place into their patch new council wards that might typically vote for other parties, making the constituency more or less safe for their own party.\nIn her written statement to the Commons, Smith said: \u201cThis change would provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions \u2013 developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation \u2013 would then be implemented without interference.\u201d\nThe government has now changed the rules so that the new map would be implemented automatically by bringing it to parliament through a mechanism called an order in council.\nThe latest boundary review process, the sixth one to take place since the 1940s, recommended in 2011 that the number of MPs should be reduced from 650 to 600, but the process has been beset with delays. Proposals laid out in 2013 that were backed by the Tories were defeated in parliament.\nThe Boundary Commission released new proposals in 2018 recommending scrapping 32 seats in England, six in Scotland, 11 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.\nThe boundaries would have scrapped Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North seat and made Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge less safe by bringing in typically Labour-voting wards in Ealing.\nA controversial \u201cDevonwall\u201d seat that crossed the counties of Devon and Cornwall was another unpopular proposal in the now-axed 2018 plan.\nSmith said the decision to abandon plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 was sensible in light of changed circumstances.\n\u201cSince that policy was established in the coalition agreement, the United Kingdom has now left the European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK parliament will have a greater workload now we are taking back control and regaining our political and economic independence.

The Guardian has been trying over the last two days, and has been unable to get through. At one stage yesterday there were queues of 145,000 people waiting to log on to the website, where all claims must start.\nAll those making a first application for universal credit would usually attend a meeting at their local job centre. However, since the Covid-19 crisis began, applicants have to call an 0800 number to make a phone appointment, but it is impossible, say applicants.\nClaimants already faced five-week waits for payments to be processed in normal times. The fear is that the system will be swamped unless the rules are changed. Many are also coming up against the problem that those with savings of more than \u00a316,000 are not entitled to universal credit.\nAnna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits expert at the financial charity Turn2Us, said claimants had been contacting the charity to report the problem, fearful that this will hold up the payments they are due.\nShe said the lack of call handlers is particularly affecting those applying for employment and support allowance, those with a disability or health condition, which rely on a phone call.\n\u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of them completing their applications, and for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. People have been contacting is to us to ask what is going on as they are finding it impossible to get through,\u201d she said.\nThe DWP said on Thursday claimants could ask for an appointment by going back online and adding a note in their journal.\nOn Wednesday the DWP\u2019s top civil servant, Peter Schofield, told MPs that processing universal credit claims had become the department\u2019s main focus.\nHe said the department had so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with universal credit claims, and the aim was to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is due to give more details of support \n later today, which may halt the rise in claims.\nThe work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cThe system is standing up to the challenge, but with a tenfold increase in claims it is inevitable that there are pressures on our services.

It was announced on Wednesday night that the number of confirmed UK cases stood at 9,529 people and the death toll had risen by 41 to 463.\nThe prime minister promised on Wednesday that the government was preparing to \u201cput its arms around every worker.\u201d He said the self-employed would be offered \u201cparity\u201d with employees \u2013 though Whitehall sources cautioned that did not mean the two schemes would be identical.\nDetails of the support package were still being finalised last night, but sources with knowledge of the plan suggested it would echo the promise of covering 80% of recent earnings that Sunak made to employees last week.\nIt could be subject to a lower cap than the \u00a32,500 in monthly pre-tax income available in that scheme, however \u2013 because the self-employed tend to pay less tax. Some groups, including those already claiming universal credit, could be excluded.\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a time in our history in the last century, certainly, when the government of this country has put its arms around so many people to get us through a very tough time. We will get through it, and we will get through it together.\u201d\nSunak significantly increased the generosity of universal credit as part of last week\u2019s package, and made it available to more self-employed workers.\nA sharp surge in claims for universal credit has underlined the severe economic toll the coronavirus is already taking on Britain\u2019s workforce.\nThe work and pensions secretary, \n, revealed on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for the benefit in the past nine days. That is more than during any entire month of the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re self-employed or at different stages, and I want to assure people that help, even if it\u2019s not currently the level of help they would like, is there to help them through the safety net of the welfare state,\u201d she said.\nKarl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe unprecedented surge in new universal credit claims shows that the UK is already in the midst of an unemployment crisis. The increase in claims is putting huge pressure on our social security system, and is driven by a huge hit to family incomes.\n\u201cThe government was right to increase the generosity of the benefits system last week. It now needs to ensure the resources are there so that claims are processed quickly, and people receive support as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is redeploying 10,000 staff to help process the extraordinary upsurge in new applications, making it the department\u2019s main focus in the weeks ahead.\nIts permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, said: \u201cWe made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things.\u201d\nThe department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who will return to the backbenches in ten days\u2019 time when a new Labour leader takes over, used what is likely to be one of his final speeches from the frontbench to call for the government to announce details of its scheme for supporting self-employed workers urgently.\n\u201cIf people claim fraudulently while still working, they will rightly be prosecuted. But right now millions of cabbies, childminders, plumbers, electricians, painters and decorators and actors have all lost work or closed down their businesses. As have builders, designated as the self-employed under the construction industry scheme and they have no income. They need a solution, now,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile businesses continued to demand clarity about who can keep travelling to work, as firms called for workers to come in despite Monday\u2019s plea by the prime minister for the nation to \u201cstay at home\u201d.\nCarolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, \n: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that many firms do not know whether to stay open or to close.\u201d She said she would meet the business secretary and request better guidance.\nThe warnings come amid widespread confusion among businesses about how to respond to the lockdown. \n, the car parts, bike and servicing group, is \n this week after being designated an essential service. It had closed its shops on Monday night as Johnson addressed the nation.\nMike Ashley\u2019s \n retail chain had intended to remain open but was \n.\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the director general of the \n, said the government needed to crack down on non-essential companies making staff attend work, telling ministers they needed to directly intervene if employers flouted the rules.\n\u201cCompanies like Sports Direct shouldn\u2019t be putting their profits before people\u2019s lives. No one in non-essential services should be forced to go to work. And no one should be sacked for following official instructions and staying home,\u201d she said.\nOff-licences and other shops licensed to sell alcohol are \n, after an 11th-hour change, while several companies are lobbying ministers to be allowed special treatment.\nThe mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called for tough enforcement action against companies forcing their staff to travel to work in non-essential jobs during the lockdown.\n\u201cThis is wrong. It\u2019s risking the health of workers, their families and wider society. In the absence of a clear government instruction to end non-essential work I am taking legal advice about whether Greater Manchester police or other agencies can take enforcement action against companies which are exposing their employees in this way.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea22048e02c73a04a9c3f245bce37f204a7fc79/239_0_2886_1731/master/2886.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b7cfedbb7dbd9db57b9d2c91c7bfb2c"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/25/prince-charles-tests-positive-for-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/25/prince-charles-tests-positive-for-coronavirus", "title": "Queen holds audience with PM by phone while Prince of Wales self-isolates with Covid-19", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 23:49:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>Monarch has weekly meeting remotely, and royal guests at Commonwealth event are told flag-bearer had coronavirus</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The Prince of Wales has coronavirus, it emerged on Wednesday, as hundreds of guests at a Commonwealth service attended by Charles and the Queen were told a flag-bearer at the event had tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p>Charles was said to be \u201cup and about\u201d and in good spirits at <a href=\"https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/royal-residences\">Birkhall, his 53,000-acre Highland estate in Scotland</a>.

He was tested on Monday after experiencing mild symptoms.\nMeanwhile pictures emerged of the Queen conducting her weekly audience with Boris Johnson by telephone from Windsor Castle. The monarch has held the weekly meeting with whoever is prime minister throughout her reign.\nClarence House said in a statement: \u201cIt is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.\u201d\nCharles joined the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on 9 March. About 2,000 people, including politicians, ambassadors and schoolchildren, also attended the service.\nIt emerged on Wednesday that a person present at the service, understood to be one of the 54 flag-bearers, had also since tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. A Commonwealth secretariat spokesperson said: \u201cStaff and other guests were informed immediately and urged to follow WHO and NHS advice. All staff are currently working from home.\u201d\nCharles, 71, was tested by the NHS after fulfilling the criteria in Aberdeenshire given his age and symptoms. He is self-isolating away from the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, also at Birkhall, but who has tested negative for the virus. She is also self-isolating.\nThe announcement by Clarence House raised immediate concerns for the health of the Queen. She last saw Charles on 12 March, following an investiture at Buckingham Palace, when the two met briefly. Doctors believe the earliest Charles would have been infectious is 13 March.\nBuckingham Palace said: \u201cHer Majesty the Queen remains in good health. The Queen last saw the Prince of Wales briefly on the morning of 12 March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.\u201d\nCharles\u2019s last public engagement was also on 12 March, when he attended a Mansion House dinner hosted by William Russell, the lord mayor of the City of London, and George Brandis, the high commissioner for Australia, in aid of the bushfire relief and recovery effort.\nThe prince attended a WaterAid meeting in central London on 10 March. Prince Albert of Monaco, who revealed five days ago that he had tested positive for Covid-19, was also at the meeting.\nMedical advice is that it is unlikely Charles\u2019s condition will escalate into a more serious case. He is thought to have first exhibited symptoms over the weekend, but they were not pronounced enough for him to reconsider his travel plans. \nThere was no comment on exactly what symptoms Charles had displayed, except that they were mild.\nHe and the duchess arrived at Birkhall, which is on the Balmoral estate, on Sunday. There is a small team of domestic staff with them, which will remain. The couple are said not to be interacting physically with their staff.\nCharles has spoken both to the Duke of Cambridge, who is in Norfolk, and the Duke of Sussex, who is on Vancouver Island, since his diagnosis.\nThough he has had no public engagements since 12 March, he has hosted a small number of private meetings at Highgrove, his home in Gloucestershire, on Duchy of Cornwall business. The relevant people have been informed, but it is not known if they have been tested.\nThe couple fulfilled the criteria for testing by the NHS in Scotland. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said in statement: \u201cDr Catherine Calderwood, chief medical officer for \n, has confirmed that their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay [their official titles in Scotland] were tested for Covid-19 for clinical reasons.

If Rishi Sunak is making a statement on support for the self-employed you should allow MPs to ask questions as well. There is no reason why this couldn\u2019t be set up with video conferencing.\u201d\nUnder questioning from MPs on the last day before recess, Rees-Mogg said he was liaising on the creation of hotlines for MPs into ministries so they could seek urgent response to coronavirus-related issues during the break.\nBoth Streeting and Bryant also suggested now could be the time to implement electronic voting, a move that the European parliament made on Monday. Although few votes are expected, Streeting said: \u201cThis is not necessarily a permanent way of running our democracy but extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\u201d\nParliamentary authorities are considering opening for two days a week after the Easter break, likely to be a Tuesday or Wednesday, with a representative proportion of the political makeup of the Commons.\nBryant suggested using Westminster Hall on the parliamentary estate to house the Commons after Easter. As one of the largest medieval halls in Europe, it could easily host 650 MPs with distance between people, he suggested.\nA Whitehall source said a range of plans were being considered, adding: \u201cThe plans have to be flexible because if we\u2019re in a Italy situation in a few weeks\u2019 time we will need a different plan to if we\u2019re in a South Korea situation.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democrats chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, said he was having talks with his government counterpart over ways to allow parliamentary scrutiny of government after the Easter recess without all MPs having to be in Westminster.\nCarmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said his revamped, physically distanced trip back to his constituency \u2013 a sleeper train to Edinburgh, a hire car to Aberdeen then a solo cabin on the ferry to Orkney \u2013 took 26 hours each way.\n\u201cThis is fine to get me home at the start of a recess, but if this were to be the regular pattern, I can\u2019t spend 52 hours a week doing this, every week. We need to find a more creative and inventive way of doing it,\u201d he said.\nWith a vote needed on a finance bill next month, Carmichael said, one option could be to only call back a proportional sample of MPs from each party, totalling 100 or fewer.\nA way to ensure scrutiny could be to hold events via video link, and to create a cross-party select committee, as New Zealand has just done, where the new body is chaired by the country\u2019s leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges.\nTalks so far with the government chief whip, Mark Spencer, had focused on pairing MPs to mean not all had to come into Westminster, Carmichael said: \u201cWhether they are prepared to go as far as the New Zealand example, I think they will need some persuasion, but after four or five weeks with no parliamentary scrutiny, I think there will be a head of steam in the country for parliament to do more than just nod stuff through.\u201d\nRobert Jenrick, the communities secretary, was challenged on whether the adjournment would prevent proper scrutiny of the government\u2019s coronavirus response, after speculation that parliament could end up being shuttered for months.\nJenrick insisted parliament would return after Easter as usual, potentially with some changes such as committee meetings held remotely.\n\u201cIt will return in the usual way so MPs can continue to hold the government to account. We live in a democracy so it is absolutely essential the government is held to account particularly in times like this. Parliament will return,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere has been another order in parliament to create ways for select committees to operate remotely. Innovation will happen to make it possible for MPs to hold us to account and that is absolutely right.\u201d\nAt least 20 MPs are confirmed or suspected to have had coronavirus, and No 10 officials, members of parliamentary staff and political journalists are also among those who are isolating.\nThe first confirmed case among MPs was Nadine Dorries, who has since returned to work as a health minister.\nParliament has continued sitting with some changes to voting to ensure that MPs are not crowding into lobbies together but keeping their distance. It broke tonight for Easter one week earlier than scheduled.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a3f7f9f65b5b979f24ce2efb7173d988f4b1ef/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8edb224677db2748e6bc40e94294ea3"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/evictions-rising-in-covid-19-crisis-warns-shadow-housing-secretary": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/evictions-rising-in-covid-19-crisis-warns-shadow-housing-secretary", "title": "Home evictions rising in Covid-19 crisis, warns Labour", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:00:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>Shadow minister calls for extra \u2018housing safety net\u2019 and tenancy guarantees for renters </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Landlords appear to be evicting tenants at record rates despite the government\u2019s promise that no one will lose their home because of coronavirus, Labour has said, as it called for an urgent package of housing benefit support.</p><p>John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said he had received a whistleblowing email from a property management company saying that evictions were at a record high in their region.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/evictions-rising-in-covid-19-crisis-warns-shadow-housing-secretary\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Landlords appear to be evicting tenants at record rates despite the government\u2019s promise that no one will lose their home because of coronavirus, \n has said, as it called for an urgent package of housing benefit support.\n, the shadow housing secretary, said he had received a whistleblowing email from a property management company saying that evictions were at a record high in their region.\nThe company told him there was anecdotal evidence that this was happening across the country, and said it was having to recruit more bailiffs to deal with demand.\n\u201cWe have appointed new agents to cope with the rapid increase in evictions,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have not seen any HM Government restrictions or official advice since the Covid-19 pandemic was announced.\n\u201cEstate agents, property management agents and landlords are very keen to evict tenants as they need the rent paid in full during these difficult times. Buy-to-let lenders have not offered any assistance to landlords from our experience. Essential workers are not exempt from such evictions.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s new emergency legislation includes measures to stop eviction for the next three months, and the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, said last week: \u201cThe government is clear \u2013 no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.\u201d\nHowever, Labour and other critics pointed out that this only extended the notice required for possession from two months to three. Shelter, the housing charity, has said 20,000 evictions are currently going through the system and some people are likely to be left homeless while ill or trying to isolate because of vulnerabilities.\nHealey said Labour was calling for a guaranteed extra safety net for renters to ensure that no one loses their home as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\nHe said the party\u2019s own analysis showed that 6 million of the country\u2019s 8.5 million renting households have no savings to fall back on and are particularly vulnerable to loss of income during the crisis.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced that the government will raise housing benefit to cover those in the cheapest 30% of private rented properties, but Labour said this did not go far enough.\nIn addition to calling for a six-month ban on evictions and rent suspensions, Healey called for a doubling in the funding for discretionary housing payments to allow councils to cover rent shortfalls in around 300,000 additional cases, and a relaxation of property size restrictions on housing benefit for private renters.\nHe said the government should also raise benefit rates for private renters to at least cover average rents in each area, and relax the current cap on benefit payments, which hits families facing high housing costs.\n\u201cAfter a decade of cuts, our housing safety net is already letting renters slip through the gaps,\u201d Healey said. \u201cIt is not fit for purpose for the period we now face when family finances will be under extra pressure.\n\u201cThe chancellor\u2019s commitments so far only partly row back on these cuts, and government action falls well short of what renters need. The government must now urgently give renters a guarantee they will not lose their home as a result of coronavirus, by strengthening the safety net for households who have their hours cut or lose their job.\u201d \n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb28cbae5210631633f801a5b99eae43f45f1cab/0_0_4907_2944/master/4907.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=969b19df0ac1996f3e53bb0ee396edd4"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/25/british-diplomat-dies-of-coronavirus-in-hungary": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/25/british-diplomat-dies-of-coronavirus-in-hungary", "title": "British diplomat dies of coronavirus in Hungary", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:40:18 GMT", "summary": "<p>Tributes paid to Steven Dick, 37, after his death in Budapest hospital</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Britain\u2019s deputy ambassador to Hungary, Steven Dick, has died in Budapest after contracting coronavirus.

He will be missed by all those who knew him and worked with him,\u201d said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.\nDick joined the FCO in 2008 and had previously been posted to Kabul and Riyadh. He took up his posting in Budapest last autumn after undergoing a year of full-time intensive Hungarian language training. He was well-liked on the diplomatic circuit in the city and was friendly, sociable and enthusiastic about his work.\nHe had recently returned to Budapest from a holiday in Mexico, and early last week he said in a WhatsApp message that he had contracted coronavirus and was in isolation, but was feeling fine except for being bored.\nLocal sources said he had been treated at a hospital in Budapest in recent days. It appears his condition deteriorated rapidly. It was not immediately clear whether he had suffered from any underlying health conditions.\nHis parents, Steven and Carol Dick, paid tribute. \u201cSteven was a much-loved son, grandson and nephew. He was kind, funny and generous. It was always his dream to work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and he was very happy representing our country overseas. We are devastated by his loss and ask for privacy at this tragic time,\u201d they said in a statement circulated by the FCO.\nSir Simon McDonald, the permanent under-secretary at the FCO, said: \u201cI knew Steven personally and he was an exemplary officer and a lovely man.

Seventy thousand of the claims were from those asking for an advance, suggesting people began to struggle with money as soon the virus began to spread more widely.\n\u201cWe made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things,\u201d he said.\nDisability benefits will no longer be assessed in job centres, ending face-to-face assessments which he said meant they are \u201cextending existing awards\u201d and no longer re-assessing personal independence payment claimants.\nThe department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nWithin weeks 10,000 employees working in functional jobs such as finance and on longer-term programmes within the department will be brought into the universal credit team.\nSchofield said: \u201cThe first people will start arriving in London job centres today from corporate centre type roles across DWP.\u201d\nHe claimed the online system to apply for the benefit was so far working well but admitted there had been problems with the online verification stage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still too early days to know whether people are getting through those in the time that I would expect them to. I suspect there are more people so far who are finding verification is holding them up,\u201d he said.\nAsked by committee chair, Labour MP Stephen Timms, if it was acceptable to tell the half a million people who applied for universal credit that they will have to wait five weeks for their first regular benefit payment.\nCoffey said: \u201cAdvances can be made to people pretty quickly.\u201d\nShe said they will be \u201csticking with\u201d the advance system and technically it is difficult to make changes to universal credit structure that people have been asking for.\nTurning the advance into a non-repayable grant, as has been suggested by some MPs, is \u201coperationally not feasible\u201d in the short-term, she said.\nShe was backed by Schofield, who said the department would stick with the existing policies and frameworks relating to the benefits system so it kept functioning.\nOf the 230,000 people who applied for universal credit last week, 70,000 asked for an advance to deal with immediate cashflow problems, which Timms suggested put them into debt to the DWP at the start of the coronavirus crisis.\nCoffey said: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being in debt. I see it as about spreading effectively an annual payment into 13 payments, rather than 12.

We do expect to remain open in selected critical locations across the country to support accommodation for emergency workers and other groups.\n\u201cWe are reviewing daily which hotels are best positioned to support the needs that arise with the government while ensuring we comply with the new restrictions in place to protect the public.\u201d\nThere were reports of hotel chain closures turning homeless guests \u2013 as well as health staff and construction workers \u2013 out on to the streets across the UK, including in Manchester, Bromley, Guildford, \n, \n, \n and \n.\nManchester city council said 100 single homeless people who had been put up by the council in two city centre Britannia hotels had been \u201cbasically thrown out\u201d overnight. The council leader, Sir Richard Leese, said it was desperately searching for new accommodation to house them.\nA Ministry of \n, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said the government had been \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that all hotels, hostels and B&Bs providing rooms for homeless people must remain open. \u201cIf a facility has a reason to close we would expect them to assist in finding alternative accommodation immediately, working closely with local councils.\u201d\nJames Yalden, 55, said he was given hours to leave the Guildford Travelodge and offered no advice on where else to go. \u201cI told them, \u2018You are going to put me on the street with my bags and the only option is to sleep in my car\u2019, and they simply said they had been told to clear the hotel by the end of the day.\n\u201cThe receptionist told me she had just been on the phone to Guildford borough council telling them they were shifting out the homeless guests put up there by the council.\u201d\nYalden, who was staying at Travelodge temporarily because his flat had been undergoing building works and was uninhabitable, said a nearby Holiday Inn was able to supply him with a room because his partner who worked for Tesco is deemed a key worker. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find myself in a position where I was pleading to stay in a Travelodge. I\u2019ll never stay in Travelodge again.\u201d\nChains such as Travelodge have made millions of pounds in recent years from local authorities by providing emergency accommodation for homeless families waiting to be placed in more suitable temporary dwellings.\nThe overnight shutdown at Travelodge branches, as well as other major chains such as Premier Inn and Jurys Inn, came as councils in several major UK cities booked hundreds of rooms in empty hotels and self-contained accommodation blocks to put up rough sleepers.\nIn London, the 300 hotel rooms that the mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced would be made available for rough sleepers have been welcomed by the charity Crisis, but it said it was \u201cnowhere near the scale it needs to be\u201d given the capital has a rough sleeping population of about 1,000 a night, with at least another 2,000 sleeping in night shelters.\nThe children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has urged ministers to allow councils to requisition empty Airbnb properties and short-term rental apartments to put up homeless families.\n of Sydenham, south London, said she had received no help from Bromley Travelodge after her disabled daughter Katrina, 20, was given an hour to leave on Tuesday afternoon. Katrina had been placed there temporarily by Lewisham council a week ago while it prepared a new specially adapted home for her.\nAlthough she was urged to leave, Katrina refused on the advice of her mother and her social worker and was eventually allowed to stay for Tuesday night. Chambers said Lewisham council had been given no advance warning of the closure. Katrina was moved with council help to a central London Travelodge on Wednesday morning.\n, 59, had been living in a Premier Inn near Heathrow airport, after Guardian readers paid for him to have a roof over his head. \n, he found himself without anywhere to stay again on Wednesday morning when the Hillingdon Premier Inn closed.\nHe telephoned Hillingdon council housing department, but was not offered any help. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue as yet where I\u2019ll be sleeping,\u201d he said. He has previously sheltered in a 24-hour McDonald\u2019s near the airport, but this too has shut. He said he had been told by his local council that there was no spare accommodation.\nIbukun-Oluwa has lived in the UK since arriving as a 20-year-old in 1980, but was wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant by the Home Office, and has been homeless for more than a decade.\n, who had been self-isolating at Heathrow Travelodge after flying in earlier this month to see his father, who has leukaemia, said he was given two hours\u2019 notice to leave. Others forced to quit included an Australian family with three children and an Asian family stuck in transit.\nMorson said there were tense scenes at the hotel reception, with some residents in tears as staff were unable to give any explanation for closing the hotel other than to say it was as a result of government guidance. They offered no advice about where else to go and no immediate refunds were offered.\nIn Birmingham, the city council has booked 200 rooms in two business hotels and is making them available to rough sleepers, including people with disputed immigration status who are usually precluded from council services. Liverpool city council said rough sleepers would be able to \u201cvery soon\u201d move into 160 self-contained apartments offered to the council.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38536c6091a97833e3e8386e9d1847c57e84bb5d/0_384_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2d4880de44e5c6eed466efb54b116f3"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/rishi-sunak-welfare-state-chancellor-self-employed-benefits-system": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/rishi-sunak-welfare-state-chancellor-self-employed-benefits-system", "title": "Rishi Sunak is doing his best \u2013 but he can't rebuild the welfare state in a week | Alfie Stirling", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:55:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>The chancellor\u2019s help for the self-employed is timely.

Together, the two schemes protect up to 80% of individual average earnings or profits for those eligible for up to three months, and at a cost that is expected to easily run into the tens of billions. In the space of just 120 hours, the UK has travelled from being one of the most liberal advanced economies in the world to one where the state is \n large swathes of earned income with a blank cheque, and for months on end.\nYet for all the talk of unprecedented measures, some things don\u2019t change. Millions remain left out of the government\u2019s economic response to the pandemic, and for the most part they are the same communities who have been neglected again and again over the past decade.\nThe two major schemes announced to date \n. All employees who have lost their job since the outset of social distancing, or who will do so before the end of April, are cast adrift. And those that see their employers cut their hours but not their entire job, will not be picked up by the schemes either.\nSelf-employed workers will have to survive more than two months with little additional protection \u2013 beyond entitlement to temporary tax deferral and loans \u2013 until the new income protection scheme is operational from the beginning of June. For many, that won\u2019t come soon enough to keep them afloat \u2013 and they will instead have to turn to the \n, joining the millions who are already reliant on either universal credit or our legacy benefit system.\nThese are not mere speculative or marginal gripes. In just nine days, \n have had to apply for universal credit. The system, already fraught with error and failings, is now straining under the pressure. Those that are able to get through the digital queues that stretch into the hundreds of thousands will be met with one of the weakest safety nets among advanced economies globally, and in the UK\u2019s own postwar history.\nAs of last year, total out-of-work payments received by UK employees were on average \n of their previous in-work income \u2013 the third lowest among 35 OECD advanced economies. Just before the crisis hit, the main adult unemployment payment was equivalent to \n \u2013 less than at any time since the creation of the welfare state in 1948.\nIt is true that universal credit has been temporarily strengthened in response to the present crisis, with an increase in the main adult payment by around \n. But this \n amounts to just \n to welfare seen since 2010. Few people can truly survive off the 90-odd quid a week that awaits those whose finances have been crippled by the present recession \u2013 and this was as true for the disabled and unemployed before this month, as it will be true for everyone over the coming weeks.\nThe chancellor will have plenty of plaudits for today\u2019s announcement, and many of them will be justified. But you can\u2019t simply rebuild a safety net in a week after destroying it for a decade. The interventions to date are as unprecedented as they are welcome. But they are also incomplete. The job is not finished. The next move must see \n properly reinforce our country\u2019s safety net, not just for the next three months but for the coming decades as well.\n Alfie Stirling is head of economics at the New Economics Foundation\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9fc1e11c327c5bc57ea8c09821dab24e9452fc/0_175_7043_4226/master/7043.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bff898134b8aa21f11138245032b5286"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-alex-salmond-a-battle-ends-a-battle-begins": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-alex-salmond-a-battle-ends-a-battle-begins", "title": "The Guardian view on Alex Salmond: a battle ends, a battle begins", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:36:34 GMT", "summary": "<p>The former Scottish first minister was acquitted on all sexual offence charges.

If nothing else, this is a difficult environment for victims.\nThe struggle between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon can only generate problems \n. But the battle draws energy from many other issues. Mr Salmond thinks Ms Sturgeon has become too cautious in her efforts to break Scotland away from the United Kingdom. Some of his supporters dislike Ms Sturgeon\u2019s feminism and her backing for women and LGBTQ+ activists within the party. Many of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s supporters dislike Mr Salmond\u2019s bombastic style and his involvement with the Kremlin-backed RT broadcaster. It adds up to a bitter yet complex fight for supremacy, which will be fought out in multiple ways, including SNP candidacies for next year\u2019s Holyrood elections.\nThere is nothing in this for the SNP. The party remains ascendant, as the 2019 general election confirmed. Its rivals are all in various states of eclipse. Yet the SNP has been in government since 2007. Its record on domestic issues is not one to boast about. Once the power struggle is resolved, the SNP will either be led by the woman who is responsible for that vulnerable record, or by the man whose pitch to the court, in the words of \n this week, was \u201cI\u2019m sleazy but not criminal\u201d. Traditionally, voters punish divided parties.\nWe shall soon see if that rule applies to the SNP. If \u2013 and it is an enormous \u201cif\u201d \u2013 one or more of the opposition parties gets its act together better, the SNP could struggle to win the decisive majority in 2021 that it seeks in order to increase the pressure for another referendum.\nRight now, all this awaits the outcome of the coronavirus emergency. All politics, even the SNP\u2019s internal battle, has to defer to the public health crisis. Yet the Covid-19 lockdown will play its part when politics resumes. The crisis puts Ms Sturgeon in the spotlight, and she is handling it well \u2013 more surely and fluently, for many, than Boris Johnson in London. Yet it is also the UK Treasury, with its deep pockets and borrowing ability, that has stood behind the Scottish economy as the crisis has brought Britain to a standstill. Scottish voters will have to factor both realities into their view of the SNP that eventually emerges from its own incipient civil war and the national crisis that now engulfs us all.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4b28a772f428e064dbe56881c6febed251486ab/0_0_3289_1974/master/3289.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=070c1c0deca049554e4da6a958d9f310"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/parliament-shuts-democracy-suspended-political-scrutiny": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/parliament-shuts-democracy-suspended-political-scrutiny", "title": "It's right that parliament shuts \u2013 but democracy can't be suspended | Polly Toynbee", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:08:50 GMT", "summary": "<p>With draconian new powers in play, proper political scrutiny is vital.

Old rituals obstruct their original democratic purposes.\nThe virus brings revelations in all walks of life as office-based employers find \n: watch commercial building rents plummet as a result. This long recess is the moment for parliament to find that it, too, can shed some its more absurd customs and practices. This is the time to set up electronic voting: no more \n in wheelchairs or sick men wheeling drips.\nIt\u2019s ridiculous enough that it takes MPs 15 minutes to trail through the lobbies to vote, but ludicrous that the last week has seen MPs taking 45 minutes, in order to observe social distancing. It needs only a little imagination to create virtual debates of the full house, since normally only some 20 or 30 MPs have their names down to speak: all could listen, all could vote.\nAfter failing at first to take serious action \u2013 a decision which may end up costing many lives \u2013 the government has now introduced the \n, rushed through of necessity in this emergency. Few doubt the need. But what\u2019s inside this huge package, how it might be used or abused, will require MPs to report back urgently on cases brought to them. Look at the \n under the Mental Health Act. Or ask why the police are suddenly allowed to retain DNA and fingerprint data for longer. Police have new, almost unlimited powers to close premises and break up gatherings: could that become a ban on all protest?\nUnder cover of this gargantuan legislation, odd things slid in: I was delighted that abortions, at long last, were to be made administratively easier to save doctors time \u2013 but no one knew it until various anti-abortion groups spotted the clause and protested, since when, alas, it has vanished as an \u201cerror\u201d. What else may lurk that MPs may need to raise?\nThere could hardly be a government less trusted to respect parliament than Boris Johnson\u2019s. After his shameless illegal \n, we know the contempt in which he holds both parliament and the judges who seek to uphold its laws. We know he fully intends to come after the judiciary to curb the rights of citizens \u2013 or parliament \u2013 to seek redress from an executive acting beyond its powers.\nFor now, in this crisis, Johnson and his government have \n. Everyone needs to feel they can trust the state, the only authority capable of seeing us through this. All of us are willing them to get it right, to acquire the \n and protective equipment for NHS and social care staff. We need their \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to \n and a cure. We need \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep employees paid, mortgages suspended and companies afloat.\nBut it took Labour to point out the equally desperate needs of the self-employed and renters \u2013 still inadequately helped. It will need Labour voices to keep pointing to weaknesses in safety nets or services failing. What\u2019s more, the government will need Labour support to retain public trust as some of these draconian measures are implemented.\nMP George Freeman, in a moment of mischief perhaps, has piped up to call for a \n. No doubt there are Tories who want to make sure, whatever happens, that Labour is fully implicated. For Labour, sharing in the burden of responsibility to support the country through this calamity is essential too, mindful of how Clement Attlee gained after the war from his share in power. But balancing scrutiny of government with support for sometimes unpopular actions will be delicate. An end to politics? Try this thought experiment: had Labour been in power, would the Tories have backed them to empty the treasury \n, or would they have accused them of using the crisis to further socialism?\nThe Electoral Reform Society advocates copying \n, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister: in a fine gesture, she has set up a \n chaired by the leader of the opposition, with a non-government majority, to meet three times weekly by video link to keep a check on her government\u2019s powers. Can anyone imagine Johnson affording Labour such power? For now, everyone pulling together is the mood of the moment, as seen in the admirable \n. But beyond this four-week recess, in the long unknowable future, democracy can\u2019t be suspended. The Speaker should use this break to surprise us all with the same willingness to change shown by everyone else in this emergency.\n Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4802efb78639f4b5bb17bc65fa9ba77b068254a1/0_78_5299_3180/master/5299.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=86ed0ffae22a92aa29260484d92ff3d3"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/media-experts-despair-boris-johnson-coronavirus-campaign": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/media-experts-despair-boris-johnson-coronavirus-campaign", "title": "Media experts despair at Boris Johnson's coronavirus campaign | Sonia Sodha", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 10:42:28 GMT", "summary": "<p>The government has got its messaging badly wrong so far \u2013 and that will cost lives</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Many of us will have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/care-loved-ones-coronavirus\">tough conversations</a> with loved ones in recent days to try to get them to take coronavirus seriously.

I broached the subject a couple of weeks ago after I saw what was happening in Italy. Government experts there were saying that 60% of us could eventually contract the virus, and I didn\u2019t want those I loved to take any risks.\nAfter 48 hours of begging, entreating and beseeching, I resorted to scare tactics. \u201cIf you end up hooked up to a ventilator with only hours to live, we won\u2019t be able to be there. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in Italy.\u201d Horrible, but it worked.\nIt\u2019s easy to look at the photos from last weekend of teeming parks and crowded pubs, and attack people for being selfish and stupid. But at least as much responsibility lies with the \n of a concerted public information campaign from the government.\nPublic health is all about behaviour change and a public health strategy lives or dies by the effectiveness of its communication. Any information campaign needs a clear instruction, wrapped up in messaging that persuades people to change their behaviour. So far, the communications experts I have spoken to have their heads in their hands over the way this has been handled.\nEven after the launch of the \u201cwash your hands\u201d campaign, Boris Johnson said he was shaking hands \n; even after we were told not to see at-risk relatives, he said he hoped to see his mother on \n. After the UK\u2019s first coronavirus death, he declared \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, an approach one former government communications director described to me as \u201cfatally flawed\u201d when tough restrictions were clearly coming down the track.\nWidely reported comments about \u201c\n\u201d implied the government was relaxed about a certain amount of transmission. Then, as the guidance changed rapidly, it was hard to work out what it meant. Were you allowed out for a walk while self-isolating? Why were pubs and restaurants allowed to stay open even though we were told not to go to them?\nTone has also been a problem: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely confident we can send coronavirus packing,\u201d Johnson said last week in a timbre more fitting of an Enid Blyton novel. Entreaties to the public have been counterproductively filled with meaningless jargon. \u201c\u2018Flatten the curve\u2019 might be the strategy but that doesn\u2019t make it your key message. It makes the problem seem more abstract and distant from people\u2019s lives,\u201d Nicky Hawkins, a communications expert at the Frameworks Institute, tells me.\nA former director of the Central Office of Information (COI), the government\u2019s in-house communications agency from 1946 until it was thrown on the bonfire of the quangos in 2011, says the government has just relied on the media to filter through announcements from press conferences and briefings that are not always accurate. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty well-established huge numbers don\u2019t look at mass media in that way any more.\u201d Back in the day, the COI would have been responsible for coordinating communications across Whitehall, with an infrastructure of regional offices to work with local government on filtering the message down to communities.\nThings have improved a bit recently with a short TV address direct to the nation with a clear message to stay home, though the advice on what you are allowed to leave home for has evolved. But what is motivating people to follow it? Thinking back to those first conversations I had with family, I wondered why the government isn\u2019t doing more to scare the nation into action, along the lines of the frightening 1980s HIV/Aids TV advert that featured a tombstone and warned \u201cdon\u2019t die of ignorance\u201d.\nBut while fear can be effective in raising awareness, it can \n if people don\u2019t understand what they need to do, and why, to avoid death. \u201cIf all you do is emphasise the fear, then people become paralysed and just want to shut the whole thing out,\u201d Hawkins says.\nNone of the government communication has explained in simple terms why staying at home makes such a big difference to infection and hence death rates \u2013 which is particularly important given that many young people have heard that the risks to them as individuals are low. Why aren\u2019t we being told that each of us staying home for a month right now could save X lives, and that they could be our parents or grandparents or the people working to keep us safe?\nBut the government simply isn\u2019t thinking hard enough about what motivates people to act. Take the \u201cpanic buying\u201d that has led to empty shelves. At a press conference, an NHS leader said we should all be ashamed that a nurse was left unable to buy food, which subsequently made headlines. Shame is a dreadfully ineffective way of trying to motivate people to change their behaviour. Why hasn\u2019t everyone appearing on a government podium been briefed to provide reassurance that the food won\u2019t run out, rather than chastise people for their lack of moral fibre?\nA lot about this is unprecedented, so no one has all the answers. But the irony is that Johnson\u2019s adviser, Dominic Cummings, made his name testing different messages in real time on Facebook to quickly ascertain which pro-Brexit messages worked. Yet the government has been incredibly slow off the mark in even using the free advertising it has been offered on \n.\nThe public information campaign will become even more important in the coming months as people become increasingly fatigued with heavy restrictions on their freedoms. The government has got it badly wrong so far, but by getting a grip on the way it communicates, it could yet save lives.\n Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14db8e0bc76aca13729dd948226db981692f45a3/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1997ab875859393e6f0e2db2f63ccf14"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed", "title": "Universal basic income is the best way to help the self-employed | Owen Jones", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:59:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>The government\u2019s plans will fall short of what\u2019s needed \u2013 payments for everyone, without preconditions<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tearful every day and not sleeping,\u201d Mish Kimani, a seamstress in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, tells me. \u201cMy future feels very bleak.\u201d Her sewing shop has been trading for more than a year but, two weeks ago, the customers vanished.

In \n. As Covid-19 overwhelms the economy\u2019s immune system, all remaining vestiges of security for these workers has been stripped away.\nTheir specialisms are varied indeed: they are gas engineers, plasterers, pet sitters, carpenters, hairdressers, construction workers, bouncers, comedians, yoga instructors, chefs, sports coaches, delivery drivers, wedding florists, animators and theatre directors\u2013 you name it.\nThey are Uber drivers like Ray Thomas, whose income has fallen to zero but has a taxi insurance worth \u00a3200 a month and car payment of \u00a3120 a week to pay, alongside rent, bills and food. He has anxiety and depression and told me he had \u201ca bit of a breakdown the other day when I found out the only thing available was the \u00a394.25 universal credit\u201d.\nThey are kayak coaches like Chris Shaw, who taught Boris Johnson\u2019s children and says he now feels \u201chung out to dry\u201d by him. He has two young sons to feed and just \u00a32,000 worth of savings from his grandfather\u2019s inheritance.\nThey are jewellery designers like Jess Jones, who is five months pregnant and now has an income that is all but gone, leaving her feeling \u201ccompletely forgotten about\u201d.\nThere are no weddings, and so Hannah Millard\u2019s photography skills are no longer required: her eldest son has a rare illness that last year left him in hospital for four months. \u201cWithout financial help, my successful business will fail and I will go bankrupt,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI feel absolutely crushed.\u201d \nFor now, their supposed lifeline has been the government\u2019s bungled universal credit scheme, offering \u00a394.25 a week with a five-week wait: the number of applicants nationally is \n. In Wolverhampton jobcentre, a universal credit work coach tells me that normally they deal with 70 claims; it\u2019s now up to 1,200 and yet staff numbers are down to a third because of self-isolation. The services are simply overwhelmed.\nRosie Parsnips, a hairdresser in Hayfield, Derbyshire, tells me that when she called the selfemployed helpline, she wasn\u2019t even placed in a queue. Many are private renters and the government\u2019s much-vaunted no-evictions policy in practice means giving tenants \n, all while building up rent arrears. \nBelatedly, the government is \n; its proposals must be scrutinised to ensure every single self-employed and gig economy worker has the income they require to support themselves and their dependants. But government briefings to sympathetic newspapers suggest such support wouldn\u2019t be available until the \n, and that ministers are concerned about any system that \u201ctook away the incentive to work\u201d, which is the entire point.\nThere is a more straightforward solution, one that has even been touted by that well-known Trot, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, \n. It is a \n, where everyone is granted a sum of money by the state as a right of citizenship and with no strings attached.\nAt the very least, it should be offered immediately and without preconditions not just to precarious and self-employed workers who fear what their plight will be next week \u2013 let alone next month \u2013 but to those who have suffered cuts to their hours and therefore pay, and the ever-surging numbers being cast into redundancy despite the government\u2019s wage-subsidy programme. The Royal Society of Arts has come up with \n: a one-off immediate payment of \u00a31,500 and then additional monthly payments of \u00a3450, combined with universal credit and housing costs.\nYet our government has \n this sensible idea, arguing that UBI would end up in the bank accounts of those who do not need it. There is a simple answer here: recoup that money by increasing taxes on the wealthy. We know that if a scheme is not universal, then it is bureaucratic, and many who need it will end up missing out. For example, it\u2019s estimated that \n. Perhaps the Conservatives fear the historical precedent of income tax, first introduced as a temporary measure to fund the Napoleonic wars in the late 18th century. But ideology is no excuse not to act decisively.\nYes, in the best of times, UBI would build a financial floor through which no citizen could fall below, and cement a decent standard of living in good times or bad for the precarious and self-employed. In a time of national emergency, it is surely a necessity: not least given that 47% of the self-employed and more than half in precarious work such as zero-hour contracts would feel they had no option but to work if ill, spreading the virus. The failure to bail them out will have other knock-on effects. If self-employed people feel they have no choice but to cut back expenditure even after the lockdown has ended, such is the hit to their livelihoods, then they will reduce their spending, sucking demand from the economy, and leading bosses to cut more incomes and more jobs.\nAn age of gaping wounds is no time for sticking plasters. If the government wishes to rescue millions who find themselves abruptly thrown into icy waters with no life boats, UBI represents the only guarantee. Whether the government has the courage to prove their critics wrong remains to be seen.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24b26f3c3904db6353065865db5970fb906fce5/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a76118a56c92f055952ac1b928d7400"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/britain-covid-19-predictions": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/britain-covid-19-predictions", "title": "We simply don't know what kind of Britain will awake from all this | Martin Kettle", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 06:00:20 GMT", "summary": "<p>Beware confident predictions of our future after the Covid-19 crisis.

If the 1918-19 flu pandemic is a guide, the Covid-19 virus may be with us for a year.\nThis length and seriousness mean that none of us yet knows what the final accounting on the Covid-19 crisis will look like. But we can say that we are likely to be living with some of the pandemic\u2019s consequences for years to come. The issues that could endure are many. They start with the shared experience of having the shadow of death hanging over our heads. They include, additionally, the impact of the massive public health emergency itself, the many transformations of everyday living, the state\u2019s mobilisation to defend the economy, and the general anxiety about the future that is \n in an Ipsos-Mori survey this week. None of these is likely to be gone by Christmas, never mind by Easter. \nFaced with an extraordinary event, it is natural to think it will have extraordinary long-term consequences too. Nevertheless, much of the speculation about this is struggling to adjust. Its feet are still firmly planted in the past. It is largely conditioned by earlier political divisions such as \n. In some cases, the pandemic is merely vindicating whatever the thinker believed in the first place, before the outbreak began. All the pandemic has done is make them believe it more strongly than ever.\nThere are three obvious problems with such an approach. The first is it assumes the pandemic will cause the scales to fall from the eyes of those who do not share it. But this may not happen. The second is that it fails to take account of how the public mood will change once the pandemic ceases. And it will. The third is that it avoids self-questioning.\nBoth left and right are currently guilty of acting as though nothing has really changed. Those on the left who believed before Covid-19 that Britain was collapsing under the weight of social inequality, a lack of Keynesian demand management or the folly of Brexit have looked at the crisis and concluded that, yes, the pandemic proves that they were right all along. Yet those on the right who believed beforehand that the economy was more reliably run in their hands, that borders needed to be rather more tightly controlled, and that nation states must make their own decisions feel equally vindicated.\nIn the same way, when it comes to attitudes towards individual politicians, Johnson\u2019s admirers now admire him even more than ever, while his detractors denounce him even more indignantly. It seems obvious to his critics that Johnson is the wrong man for the crisis and equally obvious to them that he is mishandling it so badly he may be overthrown. But the opinion polls don\u2019t say that. A lot of people elected Johnson in December and \n. \nEveryone in these debates could use a bit of humility and a dose of open-mindedness. That\u2019s true on both sides. It\u2019s true for all of us. The right has been forced to relearn the prime importance of the state as guarantor in a period of emergency. It is having to accept the state\u2019s irreducible responsibility to the most vulnerable. It has also, perhaps, learned that what a health service can achieve reflects the investment that has been made in it, although no health service anywhere has been or could have been fully prepared.\nBut the left has lessons to learn too. Many of the takeaways from the Covid-19 crisis may seem obvious. But what is true during a crisis is not necessarily true or desirable when the crisis is over. The NHS needs whatever it takes in a crisis, but at other times health service spending is as long as a piece of string and there has to be a cut-off point, if only to allow spending elsewhere. The borrowing that may or may not save the economy from recession in a crisis will also have to be paid for when the crisis is over. People may trust Johnson with powers they would not want \n to possess.\nWe are sailing in the dark towards an unknown future. Britain\u2019s mood after the first world war and the flu pandemic has been described by the\n as \u201cthe morbid age\u201d. It was, Overy says, an era of fear and paranoia about a dystopian future. Few put their faith in traditional politics. Britain after the second was very different. \u201cNever again\u201d was its more optimistic motto. No one can say which of these moods, or what other mood, is likely after the Covid-19 pandemic .

The Times \n today: \u201cIf the coronavirus lockdown leads to a fall in GDP of more than 6.4% more years of life will be lost due to recession than will be gained through beating the virus.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know where to start with this nonsense. It\u2019s based on a paper currently under review at a journal entitled Nanotechnology Perceptions, which simply assumes that a fall in GDP translates mechanically and directly into a fall in life expectancy.\nIt\u2019s this sort of reasoning that appears to be leading President Trump to \n in the US, claiming that far more people would die of suicide from a \u201cterrible economy\u201d than from the virus.\nBut the premise is simply wrong. A recession \u2013 a short-term, temporary fall in GDP \u2013 need not, and indeed normally does not, reduce life expectancy. Indeed, counterintuitively, the weight of the \n is that recessions actually lead to people living longer. Suicides do indeed go up, but other causes of death, such as road accidents and alcohol-related disease, fall.\nSo at the most basic level, this argument ignores what the evidence says. But perhaps more importantly, the idea that the way to minimise the economic damage is to remove the restrictions before they\u2019ve done their job \u2013 definitively suppressing the spread of the virus \u2013 is a terrible one.\nDoes anyone believe that, whatever the government said, we could get back to \u201cnormal\u201d, or something close to it, any time soon? If we were all allowed to return to work, many or most of us would, quite rationally, choose not to, for fear of catching the virus. And if, as the scientists predict, the result of loosening the restrictions was an acceleration in infections, then pretty soon many firms would simply stop functioning, as workers became sick, or had to stay at home to look after family members.\nMore broadly, restoring the economy to normal requires, above all, confidence. Amid continuing uncertainty both about their own finances and the wider economy, households won\u2019t spend and businesses won\u2019t invest. And that simply isn\u2019t going to happen until the spread of the diseases has been contained.\nSo there is no tradeoff here. \n and economic considerations point in exactly the same direction in the short term. Do whatever it takes \u2013 and whatever it costs \u2013 and do it now, in the interests both of our health and our collective wealth.\nBut what comes next? It is entirely reasonable to point out that serious damage to the economy, if it persists over the longer term, will \n and maybe even \u2013 as austerity and its aftermath have done \u2013 life expectancy. The last 10 days have seen universal credit \n, to half a million, while \nsuggests that 2 million people may have lost their job. The recession is already here.\nBut this need not, and should not, be permanent. The risk here is that we allow the inevitable fall in GDP that results from shutting down the economy to drive firms out of business and workers into long-term unemployment. And there is nothing inevitable at all about this.\nAfter all, many European countries, such as France or Italy, probably, see their GDP fall by 10% or 20% or so in absolute terms every August when workers take their summer holidays. No one notices \u2013 the numbers are \u201cseasonally adjusted\u201d to take account of holidays, which means it doesn\u2019t show up in the published data \u2013 nor does it do any damage. Workers continue to be paid, and businesses don\u2019t go bust just because they\u2019re not making any money. Come September, everyone gets back to work as normal.\nOf course this is very different \u2013 that won\u2019t happen automatically with Covid-19. The impacts are more widespread and long-lasting \u2013 and we don\u2019t know how long \u2013 than an enforced extra holiday. But rapid and appropriate action by government can go a long way. Keeping workers in jobs and \n needs to be the priority. In the circumstances, the government\u2019s made a good start, although there\u2019s \n.\nSo what we should be worried about \u2013 both from an economic and a health perspective \u2013 is not how much GDP falls. It\u2019s going to fall by a lot, and that\u2019s a good thing. If it didn\u2019t \u2013 if people were still going to work despite being told not to \u2013 then the lockdown wouldn\u2019t be working and we\u2019d still see economic consequences further down the line. It\u2019s what happens to GDP in a year or 18 months that matters.\nAnd the long-term consequences? It wasn\u2019t the sharp fall in GDP in 2008-9 that reduced, over the course of the next decade, \n. It was how the government chose to address the economic fallout of the global financial crisis \u2013 by underfunding and understaffing the NHS and social care, and by eroding the basic welfare safety net that people depend on when times are hard. As we are now discovering, these were false economies that left us less, not more, prepared for this crisis.\nSimilarly, if we allow Covid-19 to permanently damage our economic and social fabric, it will be our own fault, not that of the virus. This time we can, and must, do better.\n Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and a former senior civil servant\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c1fcf9e1cb86e9d80c88c811f18b64a6576d4ea/0_286_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=552134fcb9ecdaeb4a2d781c90082cc3"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/government-covid-19-plan-holes-four-groups": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/government-covid-19-plan-holes-four-groups", "title": "The government's Covid-19 plan is full of holes \u2013 we must look after these four groups | John McDonnell", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 14:43:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>The self-employed and dependent contractors, people on reduced hours, carers and temps all need clarity and security</p><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-live-news-india-lockdown-italy-cases-restrictions-uk-us-outbreak-australia-china-hubei-latest-updates\">Coronavirus: latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">All our coronavirus coverage</a></li><p>The coronavirus crisis is causing untold grief, anxiety, and economic damage.

Tackling it requires cross-party commitment. In that spirit we in the Labour party are meeting with the government and sharing our ideas as constructively as possible.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t be doing our job right now if we didn\u2019t also point out to the government where its response to coronavirus ignores key groups of people. Highlighting the gaps in what the government is doing will help to ensure we have the best package of measures to support wages, welfare, and wellbeing.\nThe government has now announced three separate sets of measures, as it tries to react to the scale of the crisis. It announced some \n in the budget a fortnight ago. It returned last week with a plan for businesses, acknowledging that its budget announcements did not go far enough. Then last Friday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced some major new protections for workers, including a \n: this allows \u201cfurloughed workers\u201d, those granted leave, to have up to 80% of their wages paid for by a government grant up to a level of \u00a32,500 a month. Workers who would have otherwise might have been laid off can remain on the payroll.\nWe welcomed the direction of the job retention scheme. But, unfortunately, in the days since that announcement, it\u2019s become clear that the scheme is full of holes. Four groups of people need urgent assurances.\nFirst, the self-employed and dependent contractors (those who are self-employed but provide a service as part of someone else\u2019s business, such as Uber drivers) are not covered by the scheme\u2019s guarantee of up to 80% of their wages. The self-employed are a diverse group, including cabbies and child-minders, plumbers and actors. The Federation of Small Businesses has been calling for the self-employed to be valued and protected. We agree.\nIt\u2019s true that there is some variation in what self-employed people are paid. But the same job retention-scheme cap of \u00a32,500 can apply to the self-employed. Recent average earnings can be used to estimate their income. Any inaccurate reporting can be picked up in tax returns filed for 2019-20. The self-employed deserve the same support as everyone else.\nSecond, the government\u2019s job retention scheme hinges on the concept of \u201cfurloughed workers\u201d. What this means is that the scheme only protects workers who have been temporarily been given all their time off work.\nThe scheme \n cover workers who stay in work on reduced hours, as the chancellor admitted in parliament yesterday. Many businesses do not have the cashflow to \u201cfurlough\u201d workers, or need to keep some workers on. It doesn\u2019t seem right that, say, an engineer still working a day a week \u2013 or a joiner that still needs to be on site two days a week \u2013 can\u2019t receive 80% of their lost wages under the government\u2019s plan.\n\u201cThat is exactly the same as every other scheme\u201d around the world, the chancellor said in parliament. But it does not appear to be the case. The New Zealand scheme, for instance, does not rely on workers being \u201cfurloughed\u201d.\nThe third group of workers who miss out under the current government response are carers, who have taken time off work to care for people who would previously have been cared for in facilities which have now closed. So parents who take time off work to care for children cannot, it seems, get 80% of their wages covered by the scheme.\nWhen I asked the chancellor about this group, he did not give a clear answer. He said: \u201cGiven the time we have available we went with a scheme that could be delivered.\u201d It seems that carers miss out.\nFinally, the chancellor said yesterday that any worker on PAYE is eligible for the scheme. But many temporary agency workers and zero-hours contract workers are not on PAYE, and not usually entitled to regular income. It seems they will not be protected by the scheme in its present form.\nAll four groups were included in Labour\u2019s proposals published last Thursday. Under \n, all workers at risk of redundancy or in companies at risk of losing significant revenue would have 100% of their wages guaranteed, with up to 90% underwritten by the state and the money going straight into the pockets of workers.\nI mention this not to score political points but merely to show that it is not impossible to devise a scheme that caters for the self-employed, carers, those working shorter hours, and workers without a formal contract of employment.\nThere are some indications that the government will shortly announce a package for the self-employed. This must also be accompanied by proposals to protect the three other excluded groups.\nAs a result of the announcement made to the public by the prime minister on Monday night, millions of workers are being prevented from earning a living to support themselves and their families through no fault of their own. Those workers so far left out from the government\u2019s protection schemes are no less entitled to support than those having their salaries guaranteed. They too must be protected.\nThere is too much ambiguity in what the government is saying right now on coronavirus \u2013 as we have seen in relation to workers who are able to go to work. The confusion has gone on long enough. People need clarity and security. We hope we\u2019ll get that from the government in the days ahead.\n John McDonnell is shadow chancellor of the exchequer\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b1ca272fb4a490c5664b3fded860145b0b06c9/0_187_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b82292fbc27d76f8e2b14b0f7b3ec64"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings", "title": "The UK's coronavirus policy may sound scientific.

That number need not have been so high.\nAt the time of writing, the numbers are \n. Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way.\nWe called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: \n. Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen.\nThe \n is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking.\nFirst, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we \n make happen, and how.\nThe modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models.\nBut if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will.\nThis was the case with the disastrous \u201c\n\u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach.\nIndividuals and scientists around the world immediately \n: there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many \n of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride.\nThis doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of \n. Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus.\nWorse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a \n.\nSecond, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the \n that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world.\nSo what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a \n for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy \u2013 aside from the moral repugnance of the idea.\nAs we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing.\nThe obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and \n rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat.\n Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

At a time of crisis, no one is an island, no one is self-made.\n\u201cThe wellbeing of the wealthiest corporate chief executive officer depends on the outsourced worker cleaning their office. At times like this we have to recognise the value of each other, and the strength of a society that cares for each other, and care for all.\u201d\nThe prime minister responded by saying: \u201cThere he and I completely agree. We will get this country through this crisis with these exceptional steps.\u201d\nIn a sometimes critical but generally even-tempered session, Johnson used his first answer to pay tribute to Corbyn, saying: \u201cWe may not agree about everything, but no one can doubt his sincerity and his desire to build a better society.\u201d\nCorbyn thanked the PM, but stressed he was not about to retire from frontline politics: \u201cHe was talking as though this was a sort of obituary.

The figure is the highest ever reported, beating the previous record of 695,000 claims filed the week ending 2 October 1982.\nThe release offers the first official glimpse of the severe economic downturn that the US faces as companies shutter businesses and states across the country move to prevent people from gathering in crowds in an attempt to contain the virus.\nUS Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has predicted unemployment in the US \u2013 close to record lows only last month \u2013 could reach 20%. The Trump administration is pushing through a\n that includes \n as well as bailouts for hard-hit industries to mitigate Covid-19\u2019s impact. But the money will not head off a huge surge in unemployment.\nNearly every state cited the impact of Covid-19, the labor department said. Service industries broadly, particularly accommodation and food services, were hard hit although states also cited healthcare and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries.\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s jobless claims confirm that the United States is in the thralls of a catastrophic unemployment crisis, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Depression,\u201d said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at the Century Foundation thinktank. \u201cThis represents the single worst one-day piece of labor market news in America\u2019s history.\u201d\nAcross the US, laid-off workers have overwhelmed state labor departments with claims for unemployment benefits. In New York City, which now accounts for roughly 5% of global Covid-19 cases, there has been a \nTaylor Cox, a 29-year-old bartender from Indianapolis, was laid off 12 days ago. \u201cPeople are scared, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. The idea of a tipped worker going without tips for eight weeks or more is one of the most frightening things to have to confront,\u201d \n.\nAhead of the labor department release, the Trump administration pushed to block states from releasing daily figures on the soaring unemployment crisis.\n and \n stopped releasing daily figures after receiving a memo from the department of labor that read: \u201cThe data from these reports is monitored closely by policy makers and financial markets to determine appropriate actions in light of fast-changing economic conditions. As such, the data must remain embargoed until the national claims report is released the following Thursday at 8.30am.\u201d\nAccording to \n there are now 55,233 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US and 802 reported deaths, up from 302 last weekend. Despite the rising casualties, president Donald Trump said this week that he would like the country \u201copened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d.\nTrump is concerned the quarantine measures could prove more harmful than the virus, an opinion that is \n. On Wednesday he tweeted: \u201cThe real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!\u201d\nLast week\u2019s sharp rise in unemployment marks the end of an historic period of US jobs growth. US employers have added jobs every month for 101 consecutive months and in March the unemployment rate was 3.5%, a 50-year low.\nEconomists said it was still too early to gauge the depth and length of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the jobs market. The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president, James Bullard, has said he expects unemployment to hit 30% in the second quarter, while Morgan Stanley has estimated that unemployment would average 12.8% over that time period.\n\u201cThere is going to be a lot of hardship for a lot of people,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group.

But the more you intervene to deal with the medical emergency, the more you put economies at risk.\u201d\nDuring the financial crisis, Brown persuaded other global leaders of the need to bail out the banks and then hosted a meeting of the \nwhich came up with a $1.1tn rescue package.\nDespite Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy, he said it was still possible to get support for an emergency body with executive powers.\nBrown said his proposed global taskforce would fight the crisis on two fronts. There would need to be a coordinated effort to find a vaccine, and to organise production, purchasing and prevent profiteering.\nMany countries have announced economic packages in the past two weeks but Brown said a taskforce could: make sure the efforts of central banks were coordinated; take steps to prevent the record flight of capital from emerging market economies; and agree a joint approach to the use of government spending to boost growth.\nBrown said there had been resistance in 2008 to using the G20 as a vehicle for tackling the financial crisis, but that it should be clear to world leaders that there was no possibility of a go-it-alone approach working.\n\u201cWe need some sort of working executive,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected - such as those in Africa.\u201d\nThe \n and the \nneeded an increase in their financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis on low- and middle-income countries, he said.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31941255d9c4ab07b6540e047daaa6503b4aade1/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b761ca96f14f2969d4f73fb60f084fc6"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sports-direct-says-it-is-struggling-to-enforce-covid-19-rules": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sports-direct-says-it-is-struggling-to-enforce-covid-19-rules", "title": "Sports Direct says it is struggling to enforce Covid-19 rules", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:06:20 GMT", "summary": "<p>Retailer attempts to fend off criticism over treatment of its warehouse workers</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Sports Direct has turned on the temporary recruitment agencies that provide thousands of staff to its controversial Derbyshire depot, as the retailer attempts to fend off criticisms about how it has safeguarded warehouse workers\u2019 health during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The company appeared to admit to failures in following Covid-19 safety standards inside the facility as it said it was reviewing the contracts of the agencies because \u201cin some cases we have struggled to enforce [with the agencies] that they adhere to government/WHO [World Health Organization] regulations\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/sports-direct-says-it-is-struggling-to-enforce-covid-19-rules\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Sports Direct has turned on the temporary recruitment agencies that provide thousands of staff to its controversial Derbyshire depot, as the retailer attempts to fend off criticisms about how it has safeguarded warehouse workers\u2019 health during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe company appeared to admit to failures in following Covid-19 safety standards inside the facility as it said it was reviewing the contracts of the agencies because \u201cin some cases we have struggled to enforce [with the agencies] that they adhere to government/WHO [World Health Organization] regulations\u201d.\nThe comments follow widespread criticisms of a variety of retailers for potentially risking their workers\u2019 health by keeping their warehouses open during the lockdown so that online operations can be kept running. The decision over whether to keep the warehouse open is down to Sports Direct, not the recruitment agencies.\nAn email sent by a Sports Direct spokesman to the Guardian said: \u201cOur overriding concern is and always has been the welfare of all staff working at Shirebrook \u2013 full time employees and agency staff alike \u2013 with a commitment to guaranteeing hours for them all.\n\u201cWe have strictly followed government/WHO guidelines and are continually advising and supporting our entire workforce so these new rules are enforced.\n\u201cFor clarity, when coronavirus hit we were mid-tender with all of our agencies, having had concerns that some of the agencies were not looking after their staff.\n\u201cWe are not downsizing but looking to work with responsible suppliers. This current, awful situation has only further highlighted how unreputable [sic] these agencies are; in some cases we have struggled to enforce that they adhere to government/WHO regulations. As a result we are currently reviewing our contracts.\u201d\nThe spokesman later attempted to recall the email, stating that it had not been approved by Sports Direct\u2019s legal department and that there was now no review.\nThe response came after the company was asked about allegations made in a series of interviews conducted by the Guardian with Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse workers and local campaigners. They alleged that Covid-19 safety standards have been ignored inside the warehouse, while it is also claimed that certain agency workers were being pressured to go to work instead of self-isolating.\nIt was also sent just a day after \n and closed all its retail stores, having initially attempted to remain open, claiming it was providing an essential service in helping people keep fit. The company has now volunteered to deliver NHS supplies around the country using its fleet of lorries.\nSeveral other retailers \u2013 including Next, Asos and Topshop \u2013 are continuing to run their online operations while the country is in lockdown.\nOn Thursday, the union Usdaw condemned Sports Direct\u2019s rival JD Sports for \u201cputting lives at risk\u201d and called for its Rochdale warehouse to be temporarily closed. Meanwhile, the fashion retailer Moss Bros has announced it is closing its online operation to protect staff.\nLocal Shirebrook campaigners have been growing increasingly concerned that some Sports Direct workers are being pushed into turning up for work and that the two metre distance rule, designed to lessen the chances of passing on Covid-19, was not being adhered to.\nA letter sent by the union Unite to Sports Direct on Tuesday evening, which has been seen by the Guardian, stated: \u201cWe are being contacted by outside agencies [ie local charities] who are raising real concerns as they have been contacted by employees in desperation who are diabetic and feel that they should be self isolating. It is reported that they have been told that they will be fired immediately if they self isolate.\n\u201cIt is [also] reported that many, many people are still working in close proximity to each other at the warehouse and are being told they are key workers and must stay at work. Additionally reports are coming in that there is very little soap available for hand washing.\u201d\nOne of the agencies said it supplied fewer than 100 workers to the site and that it would \u201cnever pressure anyone to go to work\u201d.

The Guardian has been trying over the last two days, and has been unable to get through. At one stage yesterday there were queues of 145,000 people waiting to log on to the website, where all claims must start.\nAll those making a first application for universal credit would usually attend a meeting at their local job centre. However, since the Covid-19 crisis began, applicants have to call an 0800 number to make a phone appointment, but it is impossible, say applicants.\nClaimants already faced five-week waits for payments to be processed in normal times. The fear is that the system will be swamped unless the rules are changed. Many are also coming up against the problem that those with savings of more than \u00a316,000 are not entitled to universal credit.\nAnna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits expert at the financial charity Turn2Us, said claimants had been contacting the charity to report the problem, fearful that this will hold up the payments they are due.\nShe said the lack of call handlers is particularly affecting those applying for employment and support allowance, those with a disability or health condition, which rely on a phone call.\n\u201cUniversal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of them completing their applications, and for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. People have been contacting is to us to ask what is going on as they are finding it impossible to get through,\u201d she said.\nThe DWP said on Thursday claimants could ask for an appointment by going back online and adding a note in their journal.\nOn Wednesday the DWP\u2019s top civil servant, Peter Schofield, told MPs that processing universal credit claims had become the department\u2019s main focus.\nHe said the department had so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with universal credit claims, and the aim was to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.\nThe chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is due to give more details of support \n later today, which may halt the rise in claims.\nThe work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cThe system is standing up to the challenge, but with a tenfold increase in claims it is inevitable that there are pressures on our services. We are taking urgent action to boost capacity, including moving 10,000 existing staff to work on new claims with 1,000 already in place, and will recruit a further 1,500 staff to aid the effort.

Overall the retailer\u2019s UK sales, including stores and online, were 35% higher over the short period than in 2019.\nDespite the recent sales bonanza, however, the company warned annual profits were now expected to fall short of the \u00a3210m pencilled in by analysts after the government \n at the start of this week.\nThe group said as a result it would miss out on about \u00a3400m of sales between now and the end of its financial year in April. \u201cThere will be some recovery through online operations but overall the loss of sales will adversely impact our full-year profitability and cash position,\u201d it said.\nThe store group said web sales had been very strong in all countries over the past fortnight as \u201cpeople have been preparing to work from home and use essential technology to continue their lives during the coronavirus outbreak\u201d. It added: \u201cEarly signs are that this strong trading has continued since stores closed and will help to compensate for lost store sales.\u201d\nIt said it had been taking additional steps to protect colleagues who were working on web orders and that it would pay shop staff who were now unable to work. \u201cWe will stand by our colleagues throughout this crisis and, with the government\u2019s help, we expect to keep paying those who work in our stores during these temporary closures,\u201d the company said.\nThe update came as official data showed that retail sales growth had stalled before the economic shock caused by the coronavirus. Sales volumes were flat in February compared with the same month in 2019 after growth of 0.9% in January, the Office for National Statistics said. This was the first time sales have not grown since March 2013, when Britain was hit by the heaviest snowfall in 30 years.\nThe outlook for retailers appears bleak, especially outside the supermarket sector. Food retailers have seen a temporary surge in demand as Britons stockpiled supplies in case they are trapped at home by illness or growing restrictions on movement.\nThomas Pugh, economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cPeople should brace for an eye-watering fall in retail sales in the region of 30% month-on-month in April. Retail sales may be flat in March as exceptionally strong food sales offset weakness elsewhere.\u201d\nThe ONS said that in February alone, sales dropped by 0.3% after a 1.1% jump in January, due to unusually bad weather and flooding in parts of Britain.\n\u201cA small number of retailers also said that the impact of the coronavirus had affected sales of goods shipped from China,\u201d said ONS statistician Rhian Murphy.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5670316437dffe886f8c4c9dc777f35e3bca2a50/0_147_5125_3077/master/5125.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47acd2a2fb7c0fbf312c0fe6fa63cb8b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/nobody-will-starve-says-ocado-chair-urging-britons-to-stop-stockpiling": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/nobody-will-starve-says-ocado-chair-urging-britons-to-stop-stockpiling", "title": "'Nobody will starve,' says Ocado chair, urging Britons to stop stockpiling", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:20:31 GMT", "summary": "<p>Stuart Rose tells shoppers to \u2018show restraint\u2019 and not waste food during lockdown</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Stuart Rose, the former Marks &amp; Spencer boss who now chairs Ocado, has urged Britons to stop stockpiling groceries, saying \u201cnobody will starve\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rose said: \u201cThere is no shortage of food.

The Covid Corporate Finance Facility (CCFF), which is the relevant Treasury-backed scheme for large companies, \u201cis open to firms that can demonstrate they were in sound financial health prior to the [coronavirus] shock\u201d, say the rules.\nIntu, to state the obvious, was not healthy. The owner of the Lakeside centre in Essex and the Trafford centre near Manchester has \u00a34.5bn of borrowings; the stock market values the equity at just \u00a350m; and the company last month failed to land a \u00a31.5bn refinancing from its shareholders, thereby creating a \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d over its future.\nYet here\u2019s a line from Intu\u2019s trading update on Thursday: \u201cWe have an ongoing dialogue with the UK government and may look to access their \u00a3330bn support package.\u201d But how? The package is not meant for companies that were already teetering on the brink.\nIntu\u2019s argument, it seems, is that commercial landlords also deserve support because the government gave tenants permission to delay rental payments for three months. And it\u2019s true that tenants used the freedom: Intu received \n.\nCome on, though, there is a limit to what the government\u2019s bridging efforts can be expected to support. If the crisis lasts for months and months, then, yes, the short-term cashflow worries of commercial landlords could become a wider issue. But we\u2019re not there yet.\nBritish Land and almost every other large commercial landlord is able to absorb a temporary hit to rental income. Intu is less able to do the same because its capital structure was unstable long before coronavirus struck. Piling yet more debt onto the current huge pile would not be useful.\nIntu\u2019s crisis is one for its current lenders to tackle, as it always was. Thursday\u2019s statement also said the company said it is seeking waivers on loan covenants from its banks. Good: that is the right approach.\nThe chancellor, \n, should stay well away. There are many more deserving cases than Intu to support.\nIn fact, the urgent problem with the Treasury package is the hole in the middle. Medium-sized companies are too large for the coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, where loans are up to \u00a35m, but many will feel the CCFF is not aimed at them.\nYou can see their point. The CCFF language is all about public credit ratings, an unknown world for, say, a family-owned business with a turnover of \u00a3100m. Applicants are allowed to use a current lender\u2019s internal credit rating or get a rating agency to make an assessment, but those are also unfamiliar hurdles.\nThe Treasury may have to show flexibility and imagination. It can lambast banks to lend more, but some of the red tape is of its own making.\nWhat you need to be be an auditor? Professional scepticism is the basic skill \u2013 and one lacking in too many cases in recent years. Now an ability to operate a drone could be handy.\nTo be clear, drone-control is not yet a necessary requirement. It\u2019s just an example of what Financial Reporting Council means by \u201calternative procedures\u201d that auditors can use to seek evidence to support an audit opinion. If a conventional stock-take is impossible because premises are locked down under coronavirus restrictions, send in a flying machine with a camera.\nRegulatory encouragement of such lateral-thinking should be welcomed. When uncertainties lie in every direction, there is a risk that auditors become inclined to take too much on trust. It would be a disaster if the definition of \u201cfair and true\u201d becomes watered down at the moment when companies\u2019 \u201cgoing concern\u201d statements are about to become the most scrutinised part of the accounts.\nThe authorities\u2019 bigger reform was to give companies six months after their financial year-end, instead of four, to publish audited numbers. That move seems sensible too: better to be accurate than fast.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9cd2ac3d299020500a97a36a19303c9eb2c57af/0_416_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=80d7b2c16f5d5488078a116d08fdfe6b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-pandemic-has-delivered-the-fastest-deepest-economic-shock-in-history": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-pandemic-has-delivered-the-fastest-deepest-economic-shock-in-history", "title": "Coronavirus pandemic has delivered the fastest, deepest economic shock in history", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 06:00:51 GMT", "summary": "<p>The financial crisis and Great Depression took three years to play out, this crisis has taken three weeks.

The US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has \n that the unemployment rate could skyrocket to above 20% (twice the peak level during the financial crisis).\nIn other words, every component of aggregate demand \u2013 consumption, capital spending, exports \u2013 is in unprecedented freefall. While most self-serving commentators have been anticipating a \n \u2013 with output falling sharply for one quarter and then rapidly recovering the next \u2013 it should now be clear that the Covid-19 crisis is something else entirely. The contraction that is now under way looks to be neither V- nor U- nor L-shaped (a sharp downturn followed by stagnation). Rather, it looks like an I: a vertical line representing financial markets and the real economy plummeting.\nNot even during the Great Depression and the second world war did the bulk of economic activity literally shut down, as it has in China, the US and Europe today. The best-case scenario would be a downturn that is more severe than the financial crisis (in terms of reduced cumulative global output) but shorter-lived, allowing for a return to positive growth by the fourth quarter of this year. In that case, markets would start to recover when the light at the end of the tunnel appears.\nBut the best-case scenario assumes several conditions. First, the US, Europe and other heavily affected economies would need to roll out widespread Covid-19 testing, tracing, and treatment measures, enforced quarantines, and a full-scale lockdown of the type that China has implemented. And, because it could take 18 months for a vaccine to be developed and produced at scale, antivirals and other therapeutics will need to be deployed on a massive scale.\nSecond, monetary policymakers \u2013 who have already done in less than a month what took them three years to do after the financial crisis \u2013 must continue to throw the kitchen sink of unconventional measures at the crisis. That means zero or negative interest rates; enhanced forward guidance; quantitative easing; and credit easing (the purchase of private assets) to backstop banks, non-banks, money market funds, and even large corporations (commercial paper and corporate bond facilities). The US Federal Reserve has expanded its \n to address the \n in global markets but we now need more facilities to encourage banks to lend to illiquid but still-solvent small and medium-size enterprises.\nThird, governments need to deploy massive fiscal stimulus, including through \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of direct cash disbursements to households. Given the size of the economic shock, fiscal deficits in advanced economies will need to increase from 2-3% of GDP to about 10% or more. Only central governments have balance sheets large and strong enough to prevent the private sector\u2019s collapse.\nBut these deficit-financed interventions must be fully monetised. If they are financed through standard government debt, interest rates would rise sharply, and the recovery would be smothered in its cradle. Given the circumstances, \n long proposed by leftists of the Modern Monetary Theory school, including helicopter drops, have become mainstream.\nUnfortunately for the best-case scenario, the public-health response in advanced economies has fallen far short of what is needed to contain the pandemic and the fiscal-policy package currently being debated is neither large nor rapid enough to create the conditions for a timely recovery. As such, the risk of a new Great Depression, worse than the original \u2013 a Greater Depression \u2013 is rising by the day.\nUnless the pandemic is stopped, economies and markets around the world will continue their freefall. But even if the pandemic is more or less contained, overall growth still may not return by the end of 2020. After all, by then, another virus season is very likely to start with new mutations; therapeutic interventions that many are counting on may turn out to be less effective than hoped. So, economies will contract again and markets will crash again.\nMoreover, the fiscal response could hit a wall if the monetisation of massive deficits starts to produce high inflation, especially if a series of virus-related negative supply shocks reduces potential growth. And many countries simply cannot undertake such borrowing in their own currency. Who will bail out governments, corporations, banks, and households in emerging markets?\nIn any case, even if the pandemic and the economic fallout were brought under control, the global economy could still be subject to a number of \u201c\n\u201d tail risks. With the US presidential election approaching, the Covid-19 crisis will give way to renewed conflicts between the west and at least four revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, all of which are already using asymmetric cyberwarfare to undermine the US from within. The inevitable cyber attacks on the US election process may lead to a contested final result, with charges of \u201crigging\u201d and the possibility of outright violence and civil disorder.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4901e64e63489bbd87cbcc04d43be8c7adc33fd/0_19_4944_2968/master/4944.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2da6fdb9b13722107d101a98b57a634"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/25/banks-and-business-caught-out-by-emergency-measures": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/mar/25/banks-and-business-caught-out-by-emergency-measures", "title": "Banks and business caught out by emergency measures", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:01:22 GMT", "summary": "<p>The regulators have urged all action necessary to get coronavirus cash to firms, with a veiled a warning if lenders don\u2019t hurry up</p><p>Get a bloody move on.

It was as recently as Monday this week that the governor and the chairs of six big banks issued a joint \u201cwe\u2019re here to help\u201d statement. Relations seemed harmonious at that point; not now.\nWhat\u2019s happened since? It seems the Treasury and the Bank have been bombarded by phone calls from irate business owners and executives who have heard about the \n, but say they can\u2019t get their hands on the promised cash.\nFor their part, the banks (or some of them) resent the idea that they\u2019re not working flat out to get money out of the door. The scheme, they point out, came with eligibility criteria and not every applicant will qualify. They\u2019re also meant to be lending only to businesses that would be viable under normal conditions.\nThere\u2019s also an under-appreciated gap in the Treasury\u2019s initiatives, say lenders. The scheme is for companies with an annual turnover of less than \u00a345m, but not all firms above that threshold have a credit rating that would allow easy access to the equivalent commercial paper scheme for larger companies. Then there are problems created by self-isolating staff being absent in branches and call centres.\nFrom the outside, it\u2019s hard to tell how serious these tensions are. The Treasury is bound to want instant implementation; lenders will inevitably say the process of distributing loans is not like turning on a tap. The picture could improve.\nYet \u201cmonitoring the situation closely\u201d is standard regulatory-speak for a heavy warning. The verbal rocket may be justified. Alternatively, the government wants someone to blame if companies go bust in their droves. Neither interpretation is good.\n\u2019s campaign to make himself the most unpopular business person in the country is going splendidly. In his latest move, the JD Wetherspoon founder has told suppliers they won\u2019t be paid until pubs reopen.\nOne can \u2013 just about \u2013 see how Martin might rationalise his hardball stance. If Wetherspoon is not allowed to sell the goods it has ordered, it should be given more time to pay, he may reason.\nYet such a literal-minded view ignores a few business realities. Wetherspoon is a large company with a strong balance sheet and ready access to bank loans. Not all its suppliers are in the same position. Big brewers can look out for themselves, but a cashflow crisis could spin out of control for the smaller food and drink crew. This is a moment for the strong to look out for the weak.\nHe presumably calculates that customers don\u2019t care enough to change their drinking and eating habits when the doors re-open. He may be right, but one wonders.\nConsumer price inflation in the UK was 1.7% in February, as if anybody is interested. The reading is from another era.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, most economists think inflation will soon fall below 1%, which sounds entirely plausible. For starters, the effect of the collapse in the \n will be felt in a wide range of goods and services.

He prides himself on his ability to \n. But even the most devoted optimist would struggle to find any upside to a global pandemic that has forced the UK into \n and shelved all of his grand plans for power.\nGovernment these days is a series of endless meetings about coronavirus. Each meeting brings with it more bad news and problems to overcome \u2013 with no end in sight.\nAs the prime minister reluctantly brings in draconian measures, reports suggest that under-strain cabinet ministers have now turned their ire on one another \u2013 competing for promotion as the \u201cchief executive\u201d of government. The news that Dominic Raab is the \u201c\n\u201d should Johnson fall ill is said to have gone down like a cup of cold sick with his rivals.\nScratch the surface and it\u2019s clear that behind the scenes all is not rosy. A team that believed their greatest challenge was delivering Brexit now finds itself having to contemplate mass burials and moral dilemmas such as the age cap for use of a ventilator. Ministers look back on the days of Brexit wars with rose-tinted glasses \u2013 that at least was a crisis in which you could go to the pub. Even those few who worried about the possibility of a pandemic were not prepared for what has come to be.\nThe big decisions are no longer made at cabinet. Instead, the action takes place at Cobra, the subcommittee \u2013 and the prime minister\u2019s morning meeting. The ministers who attend \u2013 or join remotely \u2013 are the ones who are most trusted in a time of crisis by No 10: \n, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. Each one chairs a coronavirus subcommittee tasked with guiding the country through an unprecedented crisis. Their aims \u2013 to protect public health and the economy \u2013 can sometimes lead to clashes.\nThe recently appointed chancellor is charged with the economic response and Raab the international response. Gove is in charge of public sector readiness, while Hancock as health secretary is focused on public health. Across government, no one is working on anything but the coronavirus. \u201cIf someone is working on something else, they are doing something wrong,\u201d explains a government aide. Their work feeds into each committee and the findings are then relayed to the prime minister.\nThe minister of the hour is Sunak. His fast promotion to chancellor had led to snipes that he would be a \u201cbaby chino\u201d \u2013 a chancellor in name only. Instead, he\u2019s become the poster boy of good government \u2013 praised for offering an emotional intelligence at the various press conferences that has at times been lacking from the prime minister. \n suggests Sunak has gone from relative unknown to most popular government minister. \u201cIn Rishi we trust,\u201d says one staffer.\nSunak is so valued that there is particular concern over what should happen if he falls ill \u2013 a fate viewed as disastrous to the current operation. He is trusted by No 10 \u2013 where some aides are pushing for full-on lockdown no matter what it means for the economy, Sunak has been praised for thinking decisions through on an economic level and adapting. His decision to meet the unions to agree wage packages last week helped to strike a tone of this being a moment for cooperation rather than point scoring.\nOther ministers are not faring so well. The announcement by No 10 that Raab was the politician who will step in to lead should the 55-year-old prime minister have to take a timeout was in many ways unsurprising \u2013 as the first secretary of state he is the de facto deputy. But it hasn\u2019t stopped the sniping. \u201cThe criticism the prime minister has had is that the chancellor is more emotional and understands the tone \u2013 Raab makes Johnson seem a world leader in emotional intelligence,\u201d sighs a senior Tory. There are worries that should Raab have to step in he could struggle to rise to the occasion.\nThe source of the most chatter within government is the discord between Hancock and Gove. Gove has even had to deny trying to usurp the health secretary \u2013 insisting that he is \n. Those who have seen the pair together in meetings doubt his sincerity.\nThe problem is not that they have different views on social distancing measures \u2013 both are thought to be more gung-ho on the issue than the PM \u2013 it\u2019s that their \n in terms of brief. Hancock takes the view that all things health come under his watch, while Gove views some issues as falling into the more general public sector brief.\nThings came to a head at a Cobra meeting last week. At the end of the meeting, attendees thought most matters had been dealt with before Gove spoke up and listed a series of measures that he thought required attention. Hancock replied that he was already on the case. \u201cIt was weird,\u201d says one insider privy to the discussion.\nBut the general view in government is that while there are some stresses, it\u2019s nothing compared to the discord that dominated the Brexit discussions under Theresa May. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at potential death projections in the hundreds of thousands, there\u2019s not much time to focus on furthering one\u2019s career,\u201d says a government figure.\nAny clashes are as likely down to stress as ego. There are no breaks, working hours are relentless and everyone is bracing for the news getting worse. Inside government, the lockdown measures are expected to go well beyond the three weeks Johnson announced. For all the responsibility the coronavirus has meant for the top ministers, it\u2019s something they would all be happy to do without.\n Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c37c43118266e5a99db1686b6d05bae5c019b2/0_438_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=698fe05176e030053f1d3d5143565b1d"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/as-if-we-were-the-disease-coronavirus-brings-prejudice-for-italys-chinese-workers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/as-if-we-were-the-disease-coronavirus-brings-prejudice-for-italys-chinese-workers", "title": "'As if we were the disease': coronavirus brings prejudice for Italy's Chinese workers", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 07:00:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>Xenophobia and job losses prompt textile industry staff in Tuscany to consider returning to China</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>At the beginning of February, Ilaria Santi, a councillor in the Italian city of Prato, in Tuscany, visited the canteen of an elementary school.

Last month Qian Zhang, 26, who owns a bar with his wife near Bassano del Grappa, told \nthat he was attacked with a bottle and told he was not allowed to enter a petrol station because: \u201cYou\u2019re Chinese, you have coronavirus.\u201d\nLa Stampa\nreported that a couple in Turin, Chen and Ye, \n with bottles by two Italian teenagers.

Prato is a focal point for the national textile industry. Many of the factories, owned by Chinese entrepreneurs, produce clothes for the Italian fashion industry. The spread of coronavirus in China and \n has had severe repercussions for the industry locally, and workers have been laid off.\n\u201cThere has been a heavy decrease in work. Many factories have decided to close, because it is not sustainable,\u201d said Marco Wong, a Prato councillor.\nAn estimated 310,000 Chinese people \n accounting for 8.3% of the country\u2019s non-EU citizens, the third largest community of foreign nationals residing in the country. More than half live in the north, with 16% residing in the provinces of Prato and Florence. Most work in the textile industry.\nAbout 30,000 Chinese people work in the Prato textile district; many don\u2019t have contracts, or work part-time, leaving them with limited or no access to social support from the government in the event they are laid off.\nFlavio Hu, from the Chinese Young Entrepreneurs Association, fears the lockdown, \n, could mean the end of the region\u2019s textile industry. \u201cWe are processing orders received before the crisis, but the buyers are not coming to place new ones. Moreover, fashion wholesale centres in Milan and Padova are now closed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is not possible to have precise data, but the estimate is that losses for Chinese entrepreneurs in the area of Prato are around \u20ac10m (\u00a39m) per month.\u201d\nA \n from the International Monetary Fund predicted Italy\u2019s GDP will fall 0.6% in 2020 while the public debt will rise to 137% of GDP. Meanwhile, the Italian Chamber of Fashion \n that \u201cwe must regard the fashion industry as one of the most affected by the diffusion of the virus Covid-19, alongside tourism and transportation\u201d.\n\u201cThe next weeks are crucial for the economy,\u201d said Matteo Caroli, an economist from Luiss University and expert in international business management.\n\u201cWe are facing a big challenge: contain the virus and protect the economy.

In other words, only buyers able to put down a 40% deposit will qualify for a loan.\nIt is understood the lender\u2019s mortgage department is currently flooded with requests for \n, which are being offered as part of the response to the coronavirus crisis, while its valuers are also unable to inspect properties.\nIn the note to brokers, Halifax said: \u201cOur priority remains the wellbeing of our colleagues and customers and we\u2019re closely monitoring the developing situation and continue to follow official guidelines. \n\u201cThis has had a direct impact on our available processing resource and we have therefore withdrawn new mortgage and remortgage products across our residential range with a loan-to-value ratio of over 60%.\u201d\nHalifax said the mortgage withdrawals apply across its Halifax Intermediaries, Scottish Widows Bank and BM Solutions brands. \u201cCustomers can still apply for a mortgage directly online with Halifax and Lloyds Bank,\u201d said a spokesperson.\nThe lender added that transfers and advances on existing loans will remain unchanged.\nMark Harris, chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a funding crisis \u2013 the banks are awash with liquidity.\n\u201cThere are two main issues. The first is a processing one \u2013 they are not all set up for staff to work from home. The big processing centres are closed and they are operating with a skeleton staff.\n\u201cThere is also the issue with valuations. A lot of the big lenders will accept desktop valuations but only to a certain loan-to-value. As they can\u2019t get a valuer out to inspect the property, it is very difficult to process a mortgage application for a higher LTV.\u201d\nMortgage brokers said Halifax\u2019s decision to halt much of its lending is the most serious since the credit crunch.\nAndrew Montlake, managing director of broker Coreco, said: \u201cThe Halifax\u2019s decision to stop lending above 60% LTV reflects the wholesale recalibration of risk that is unfolding in the mortgage market.\u201d\nOther lenders are likely to follow Halifax. HSBC said: \u201cThere are no current plans to change our mortgage lending approach at this stage, though clearly we will have to monitor service levels in these unprecedented times.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Nationwide said: \u201cWe continue to support the market within the constraints of the current environment. We do not plan to pull our mortgage products at this time, but certain applications may take longer to progress.\u201d\nPart of the reason for Halifax\u2019s decision is that its staff are dealing with an unprecedented flood of requests for mortgage holidays.\nHarris added: \u201cLenders are throwing all their resources into dealing with payment holiday requests. In the same way that people are buying food they don\u2019t need, people are asking for payment holidays when they don\u2019t need them.

All these measures do is extend the notice period for evictions to three months, which will provide little comfort to those faced with losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic.\n\u201cEqually worrying is the lack of provision made for rent arrears, which will stack up in the three-month period. Many renters will end up with thousands of pounds worth of debt and no means of paying it off.

Water companies and government planners will also benefit, as the resilience of current systems can be compared with real historical conditions.\nThis is the biggest such project yet, and Hawkins hopes to amass as near complete a record as possible from the 1820s to the 1960s, when digitised records began. There have been three \n, in which volunteers transcribed measurements from a weather station on top of Ben Nevis and early Victorian records.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffc5c5bd27587fdccf5143e00eb591e9d5439a9/0_307_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7a817995d74b42a5f548ee288712f586"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/nasa-moon-mission-2024-set-back-by-coronavirus-crisis": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/nasa-moon-mission-2024-set-back-by-coronavirus-crisis", "title": "Nasa moon mission plans set back by coronavirus crisis", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 21:30:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Work on the Orion capsule and the Space Launch System suspended until Covid-19 outbreak has passed</p><p>Welcome to a new semi-regular column about Nasa\u2019s progress towards landing astronauts on the moon during 2024.</p><p>This challenging schedule, which was mandated by the White House, has now been made more difficult by the coronavirus outbreak.

That number need not have been so high.\nAt the time of writing, the numbers are \n. Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way.\nWe called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: \n. Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen.\nThe \n is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking.\nFirst, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we \n make happen, and how.\nThe modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models.\nBut if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will.\nThis was the case with the disastrous \u201c\n\u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach.\nIndividuals and scientists around the world immediately \n: there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many \n of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride.\nThis doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of \n. Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus.\nWorse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a \n.\nSecond, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the \n that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world.\nSo what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a \n for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy \u2013 aside from the moral repugnance of the idea.\nAs we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing.\nThe obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and \n rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat.\n Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

Humans, pigs, spiders and butterflies are all bilaterians, but creatures such as jellyfish are not.\nDr Scott Evans, of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and a co-author of the research, said: \u201cThe major finding of the paper is that this is possibly the oldest bilaterian yet recognised in the fossil record. \u200bBecause humans are bilaterians, we can say that this was a very early relative and possibly one of the first on the diverse bilaterian tree of life.\u201d\nWriting in the \n, Scott and colleagues in the US and Australia report how they made their discovery in sandstone at sites including fossil-rich Nilpena. They say careful analysis ruled out the possibility that the fossils were actually formed by the action of currents or from microbial mats.\nThe animal has been named \nin reference to an Indigenous term for Wilpena Pound, a nearby landmark, and the Warioota Creek that is close to the sites of the find.\nThe team not only found burrows, but more than 100 fossils of the tiny creatures themselves \u2013 essentially impressions of the animal in the rock \u2013 an unusual discovery since \n, like many other animals of the time, were soft-bodied.\nThat, the researchers say, is important: bilateral organisms are thought to have evolved during the Ediacaran period that stretched from 571m to 539m years ago, however previous evidence for such creatures has largely relied on traces such as the burrows they made.\nWhile the creatures were tiny \u2013 between 2mm and 7mm in length \u2013 their form reveals vital clues.\n\u201cOne major difference with a grain of rice is that \nhad a large and small end,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThis may seem trivial but that means it had a distinct front and back end, which is the kind of organisation that leads to the variety of things with heads and tails that are around today.\u201d\nThe team say analysis of the burrows suggests \n would have moved through the sediment of its shallow marine environment rather like an earthworm, by contracting groups of muscles. Furthermore, it would most probably have had a mouth and anus connected by a gut and fed on dead animals and other organic matter \u2013 conclusions drawn from the current finds together with evidence from similar burrows discovered several years previously within the fossils of other animals.\n\u201cWe also can see from the burrows that it targeted food and oxygen, which tells us that it had the ability to sense things in its environment,\u201d said Evans, adding that this offered new insights into our oldest bilaterian ancestors.\nProf Simon Conway Morris from the \n, who was not involved in the work, described the findings as exciting. He said: \u201cAlthough the tiny fossils are near the limits of resolution they both tantalisingly suggest a creature very close to the earliest known ancestor of all advanced animals and, even more intriguingly, a likely association with small traces made as the animal forged through the sediment in search of food.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fafeb3138fffbd0bcf08ab86346ce68999c529e/0_0_1299_1299/master/1299.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37df504210688e9826ce3da5919d22d0"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/scientists-effects-coronavirus-children-studies-carriers", "title": "What scientists know so far about the effects of coronavirus on children | Jonathan Ball", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 11:08:15 GMT", "summary": "<p>Studies show that young people are at less risk of serious illness \u2013 but as invisible carriers they may be key to spreading the virus</p><ul><li>Jonathan Ball is a professor of molecular virology</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>At first it was only elderly people.

These were the groups initially urged to socially distance themselves. But we\u2019re beginning to see that coronavirus can make \n. Crucially, although the majority of younger people and children will develop symptoms little worse than flu, they could be invisible carriers of the virus \u2013 and play a key role in its spread.\nCompared to other European countries, the UK was slow in closing schools \u2013 waiting until there had already been \n to take action. Studies from China showed children were \n, and therefore presumably had little role in the spread of the disease.\nBut most of the diagnostic efforts in China, especially in the early phases of the outbreak, were heavily skewed towards hospital admissions. The majority of hospitalised cases \n. Did this mean that children and young people weren\u2019t infected, or merely that they suffered more mild symptoms, which were going undetected?\nLike many of my colleagues, I could see no obvious reason why children weren\u2019t being infected: this was a virus spread by the respiratory route, not through a process unique to adults. If significant numbers of children \n infected and suffered very minor cold-like symptoms, then their potential to spread the virus was immense.\nOne of the key differences between the novel coronavirus and \n and \n is that people with Covid-19 may have only mild symptoms \u2013 making it more difficult to detect. With Sars, most people infected quickly developed pneumonia. Identifying and isolating people with severe symptoms is a relatively easy task, and this made infection control through case identification and contact tracing comparatively easy.\nThe current coronavirus is different. In more than 85% of confirmed cases symptoms can go undetected or be easily confused with the common cold of mild flu. Its biggest weapon \u2013 the thing that has, \n, allowed it to spread so easily \u2013 is this ability to \n in the majority of people it infects. When you can\u2019t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, case identification and infection control are far more difficult.\nFar from being \n, children could in fact be its unseen carriers, important links in community transmission chains. But there\u2019s still an important piece of the jigsaw missing. While many of us suspect that children have a key role to play in this outbreak, hard evidence to support this belief is still lacking.\nIn perhaps the largest \n of its type, Chinese researchers examined infection outcomes in more than 2,000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases of Covid-19. Just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all.\nSevere and critical diseases, where body oxygen levels are low and various organs are under threat, were seen in around 5% of the children studied, with the youngest (under one year old) most at risk. There are still significant gaps in this analysis. Importantly, most of these were suspected rather than confirmed Covid-19 cases. But this study does at least reaffirm that most infections in children are mild.\nJudging from past pandemics, \n can be an effective way to reduce the spread of a virus \u2013 particularly when they form part of a larger programme of social distancing measures. Every school day, children congregate en masse, often in close proximity, and then return home, taking with them any new infection they\u2019ve picked up. Intuitively, reducing this cycle should help slow the virus.\nBy assuming that the young and healthy weren\u2019t at risk, the UK government may have underestimated the effects of coronavirus. Indeed, reports of hospital admissions show that even among younger people this is a virus that can cause serious disease. A \n from the US shows that 38% of 508 patients hospitalised with coronavirus were aged between 20 and 54 (children under 19 accounted for less than 1% of the total admissions).

The paper by the \n, a nonprofit medical organisation, found that chloroquine and Kaletra, a HIV drug also being used against coronavirus, can cause the heart muscle to take longer than normal to recharge between beats.\nTrump\u2019s comments, for which \n, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there was only anecdotal evidence, prompted some experts to warn of the risk of individuals self-medicating with untested and inappropriate drugs.\n\u201cThe last thing that we want right now is to inundate our emergency departments with patients who believe they found a vague and risky solution that could potentially jeopardise their health,\u201d \n, the medical director of the Banner poison and drug information centre in Phoenix.\nAlready some patients who rely on chloroquine for other conditions \u2013 including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 have complained about not being able to find the drug.\nAmong them was Stacy Torres, a US academic who wrote \n pleading with people not to hoard the drug.\nWhile chloroquine is one of several drugs \u2013 including existing flu medicines and HIV retrovirals \u2013 being examined around the world for their potential to reduce symptoms in those who have the disease, not as vaccines, its efficacy has yet to be properly established in clinical tests.\nChloroquine was first looked at by researchers during the 2002-03 outbreak of Sars, a coronavirus with substantial similarities to Covid-19.\nA study in Virology Journal in 2005 found that chloroquine inhibited the Sars virus in primate cells after infection, as well as inhibiting infection before exposure, successfully reducing the so-called viral load that other recent research suggests may be a predictor of severe cases.\nThe idea is that existing drugs such as chloroquine that could slow or even kill coronavirus could save the lives of severely ill patients and also protect health workers.\nThe interest in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is serious enough that the World Health Organization has identified them as one of four potential therapies to include in \n, along with three other potential drug therapies.\nInterest in chloroquine as a treatment for coronaviruses was initially reignited by a letter from \n journal this year that suggested it had \u201cpotent efficacy\u201d in treating pneumonia caused by Covid-19, but no data on studies has yet been shared with the World Health Organization.\nA small French study involving several dozen patients infected with the virus also suggested promising results.\nDespite the interest in chloroquine as an anti-viral treatment it has proved to be a dead end before in human trials for other viruses, including dengue and chikungunya.\n\u201cResearchers have tried this drug on virus after virus, and it never works out in humans. The dose needed is just too high,\u201d Susanne Herold, an expert on pulmonary infections at the University of Giessen, recently told Science magazine.\nThe hype around the drug, however, has caused some countries to rush to acquire stocks, leading some to warn that it might not be available for those who need it for proven applications such as malaria and some forms of arthritis.\nAmong those countries was Indonesia, whose president, Joko Widodo, said he was importing millions of packs of both the flu drug Avigan and chloroquine. He said these medicines \u201chave been proven to cure Covid-19 in other countries, although no one has discovered the Covid-19 antivirus\u201d, according to the Jakarta Post.\nWidodo, who has faced growing criticism over his handling of the outbreak, has since said there is \u201cneither a cure nor an antivirus to Covid-19\u201d.\nThe experiences of other countries, he said, suggested that chloroquine could be used to help patients to recover.

It happened with the Sars-CoV virus in 2002-3 \u2013 which was contained before it caused a pandemic \u2013 and it has happened again with its close relative, Sars-CoV-2.\nBut to understand why the emergence of such \n \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 has accelerated in recent decades, you have to understand the forces putting those viruses in our path. They are political and economic. They have to do with the rise of industrial-scale farming concerns in China and the resulting marginalisation of millions of smallholder farmers. In order to survive, those farmers have moved into the production of more exotic species \u2013 animals that were once eaten only for subsistence. But the bigger operations have pushed the farmers out geographically too, as they have taken up more prime farming land. The smallholders have been forced closer to uncultivable zones such as forests, where bats \u2013 reservoirs for coronaviruses \u2013 lurk. The stars have aligned, and not in a good way, to channel bat viruses through intermediate mammalian hosts such as pangolins, and into humans.\nEven so, to play devil\u2019s advocate for a moment, the problem could still be regarded as uniquely Chinese. But there are two reasons why that\u2019s not true. First, with the opening up of China, its agribusiness has ceased to be wholly Chinese-owned. It is a big recipient of \n. Second, as the American pandemic expert, David Morens, and his colleagues \n in the New England Journal of Medicine, we\u2019ve been watching a similar drama unfold over a much longer timescale with influenza \u2013 the disease that has caused more pandemics in the history of humanity than any other.\nFlu viruses that infect animals, including poultry and pigs, have periodically spilled over into humans ever since we domesticated those animals millennia ago. But the factory farms that produce our food today \n of those flu viruses just before they spill over. This ratcheting up has been documented in Europe, Australia and the US more than it has in poor or emerging economies, and it\u2019s what gave rise to the last flu pandemic in 2009. The first cases of that pandemic were recorded in California, but nobody calls it the American flu \u2013 and it\u2019s right that they don\u2019t, if only because American farms aren\u2019t wholly American-owned either. China, for one, has \n.\nIt\u2019s not just the industries that produce our food that are creating the conditions in which new zoonoses emerge. Logging, mining, road-building and rapid urbanisation are also contributing, and the profits from those are shared internationally too. \u201cWe have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses,\u201d wrote Morens et al. The resulting diseases are suffered locally at first, as is reflected in their names \u2013 Ebola and Zika virus diseases and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, to name just three \u2013 but the irony is that some of them, such as HIV and Covid-19, go on to become global. It\u2019s hard not to see a terrible natural justice in that.\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines on \n, which stipulated that such names should not single out particular human populations, places, animals or food. Names that commit those sins often turn out to be wrong anyway, but by the time that becomes clear the damage has already been done. Gay-related immune deficiency or Grid, the first name given to Aids, stigmatised the gay community while stymying research into how the disease affected other groups. President Trump\u2019s labelling of Sars-CoV-2 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d is also unhelpful. At a time when the main centres of Covid-19 infection are outside China, and Americans and Europeans could be learning valuable lessons from the Chinese, he is exchanging insults with Chinese politicians who have accused him of racism and hinted \u2013 just as preposterously \u2013 that the US military brought the virus to China. The slanging match suits Trump, distracting from his \n at home, but it does the rest of us no favours.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean China shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for its shortcomings. Americans know where their weak points are \u2013 they include agricultural fairs, where pigs and humans come together \u2013 and they police them ferociously. Their infectious disease experts can \n circulating in a herd and generate a vaccine to it within hours. The Chinese have got better at this lately. They now vaccinate their poultry flocks against a dangerous flu virus, H7N9, which first infected humans in 2013, for example. But nearly 20 years after Sars-CoV spilled over in a wet market, those places still appear to be a liability.\nControlling that animal-human interface is obviously important, but it shouldn\u2019t blind us to the bigger problem, which is those globalised industries. Economists use the term \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d to describe a shared resource \u2013 common grazing land, say \u2013 that is spoiled by individuals acting in their own self-interest. It has been applied to the climate crisis, but as University of British Columbia geographer Luke Bergmann and his colleagues have \n, it doesn\u2019t quite fit what has happened here. In the case of these industries, it would be more accurate to say that they have excluded the nearly 8 billion of us who depend on the commons from participating in their governance. Yet we are bearing the costs of their industrial exploitation, in the form of pandemic disease.\nWe have our share of responsibility, as individuals, in the foods we choose to eat and the lifestyle choices we make generally. There are a lot of us on this planet and sustaining us is costly. But as has become increasingly clear, these industries have decoupled themselves from consumer choice; they\u2019re driving it rather than responding to it.\nIt\u2019s time we took back the commons, which means voting for politicians who will hold those industries accountable, rather than ones who deflect the blame. We need leaders who understand that the treatment for this particular eruption cannot only be topical, it has to be systemic too.\n Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f26c5711a6e166c4ba7dca80e146aa490fa5794/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6488528a878ce8292d3e952fdb7a78bf"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/mar/24/covid-19-how-long-can-it-survive-outside-the-body": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/mar/24/covid-19-how-long-can-it-survive-outside-the-body", "title": "Covid-19: how long can it survive outside the body?", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 05:00:23 GMT", "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a> speaks to <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=DPILL78\">Prof Deenan Pillay</a> about how the virus contaminates surfaces and why headlines about how long it can survive may be misleading.

Chloroquine and a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, are among the four treatments tested in an international clinical trial, announced on Wednesday by the \n (WHO), and the UK has added chloroquine to its list of medicines under export controls.\nKaletra is a combination of two antiviral medicines, lopinavir and ritonavir, normally used to treat HIV, which lab studies suggested held promise as a potential Covid-19 treatment. However, these hopes suffered a significant setback this week with one of the first major studies of 200 seriously ill patients from China finding no benefit. The study is not the end of the road: it is possible that the drug could be effective if given earlier on, or to less severely ill patients. The WHO \n in a major multi-country trial launched this week.\nThe Japanese flu drug, made by a subsidiary of Fujifilm, has created a stir by more than halving the time that people with Covid-19 test positive for the virus. A Chinese trial in 340 people showed that the virus tended to be cleared in four days in those who received the drug, versus 11 days in those who went without. Chest scans supported the findings, revealing less damage in those who took the drug. But the antiviral, also known as Avigan, may need to be given before virus levels peak in the body. A Japanese health official told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper that it did not appear to work as well in severely ill people, in whom the virus had had more time to replicate.\nRemdesivir was originally developed as an Ebola treatment, but the drug has emerged as a frontrunner among potential antiviral drugs to combat Covid-19. The enthusiasm comes from studies that show that it works against \n and Mers, two other coronaviruses that are more lethal but less transmissible. The drug works by shutting off the virus\u2019s ability to replicate itself inside cells. This means it is most likely to be effective when a person has just caught the bug and the virus is still reproducing in the upper respiratory tract. One reason for caution is that early data suggest people may already have high levels of the virus when they start showing symptoms. Multiple trials are under way to evaluate remdesivir in China, the US and Asia, with the first results due in April.\nDoctors in China have treated some critically ill patients with the blood plasma of recovered patients, an approach that dates back to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. The logic is that the blood should contain antibodies to help fight off infection. Downsides include the difficulties of scaling up the method for widespread use, the risk of transmitting other diseases and that the relevant antibodies are only present in small amounts, so the treatment, if effective at all, is far from optimal. A number of teams, including the US company Regeneron, are working on the hi-tech equivalent of serum therapy. \n it is a few weeks away from identifying two powerful antibodies that protect against Covid-19, which it will then manufacture synthetically and turn into a therapeutic cocktail, with a view to starting human trials in the summer. If successful, an antibody therapy could be used as both a treatment and a prophylactic to protect health workers and other high-risk groups.\nThe UK biotech firm Synairgen has been given fast-track approval to trial a lung-disease drug in Covid-19 sufferers. The compound, interferon beta, forms part of the lung\u2019s natural defence system against viruses and was originally developed for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or COPD. The hope is that administering interferon beta boosts the body\u2019s ability to fight the virus, especially in those who have weakened immune systems. It was identified in February by the WHO as the only therapy in phase-2 trials that can be inhaled, meaning patients can administer it themselves through a small battery-operated nebuliser.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f340e7292aa7dffde246057c9b7140faa9c05de/0_149_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3580ae87893703222f8bd8567b0d38c1"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-live-news-update-world-lockdown-global-deaths-india-uk-us-australia-china-latest-updates": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-live-news-update-world-lockdown-global-deaths-india-uk-us-australia-china-latest-updates", "title": "Coronavirus live news: China closes borders to foreign nationals, as global infections pass 500,000", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:59:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>Spain death toll passes 4,000; IMF urges G20 to double emergency funding; WHO sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-mar-26\">Coronavirus latest \u2013 at a glance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/26/uk-coronavirus-live-news-updates-self-employed-rishi-sunakhospital-car-parking-charges-waived-for-nhs-staff-in-england\">UK coronavirus - live updates</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">US coronavirus: record 3.3m people file for unemployment</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">Men are much more likely to die from Covid-19.

They include California-based Biomerica, which is selling to Europe and the Middle East, and New York-based Chembio Diagnostics, which is selling to Brazil.\n\u201cSome are developed now. We are looking at the ones in Singapore,\u201d Birx said on Monday at a White House press briefing. \u201cWe are very quality-oriented. We don\u2019t want false positives.\u201d\nUK firms and academics have also developed self-test kits for Covid-19 that are expected to be available to buy in the coming weeks or months.\nOne cheap test is made by Mologic, a diagnostic test firm based in Bedford. Another kit has been developed by researchers at three UK universities led by Brunel University.\nMologic has produced the first prototypes of an antibody test for Covid-19, building on its experience of developing a rapid test kit for Ebola. Assessment and validation of the test began this week at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George\u2019s, University of London.\nThe company said it would take three to four months before the test is available in the UK and other countries. It will cost \u00a31 in the UK and will be as simple to use as a home pregnancy test but will use saliva or blood rather than urine, with results ready in 10 minutes. \nMologic, which \n to develop the test, will be able to make 8m kits a year at facilities in the UK and Senegal. In Senegal it will be sold for less than $1.\nThese tests could be a game-changer for diagnosis and follow-up of patients both in hospital and in the community, allowing us to detect cases early and isolate patients and their families rapidly,\u201d said Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer in diagnostics for infectious disease at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\nThe test kit \n, Lancaster University and the University of Surrey is based on science evaluated in the Philippines to check chickens for viral infections. \nThe battery-operated handheld device processes nasal or throat swabs that are inserted into it, and delivers the results within 30 to 45 minutes via a smartphone app. The team has approached UK, US and European regulators for approval and is in talks with 60 manufacturers. It could be available to the public within a few weeks.\nThe device will be priced at \u00a3100 and can test six people at once. The test can detect the virus in individuals who show no symptoms because it recognises the DNA structure of the virus in the samples.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6a13864be4b89c1257560f3c5f4fc51730e7b2d/0_119_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=759404242164d81e4911dd8a726663aa"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/cave-find-shows-neanderthals-collected-seafood-scientists-say": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/cave-find-shows-neanderthals-collected-seafood-scientists-say", "title": "Cave find shows Neanderthals collected seafood, scientists say", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:00:34 GMT", "summary": "<p>Discovery adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals were very similar to modern humans </p><p>Neanderthals made extensive use of coastal environments, munching on fish, crabs and mussels, researchers have found, in the latest study to reveal similarities between modern humans and our big-browed cousins.</p><p>Until now, many Neanderthal sites had shown only small-scale use of marine resources; for example, scattered shells.

But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of \n and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago.\nResearchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans.\nProf Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar.\n\u201cI feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.\u201d\nThe findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had \n and may have \n. Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were \n 65,000 years ago.\n\u201cForget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o. \u201cThe real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.\u201d\nThe discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition.\n\u201cIf [marine foods] were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as well \u2013 or perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them,\u201d said Zilh\u00e3o, noting that in any case few modern humans were living by the coast.\n, researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a diverse diet.\nZilh\u00e3o said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. \u201cYou cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,\u201d he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic.\nThe team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today\u2019s levels.\nThe stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved.\nDr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of \n who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant.\n\u201cWe have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,\u201d he said. \u201cEvidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3dde18970ad430589736e6e1dabcea06a0b27d/0_132_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57821f65406aed852247ac76fe5977d4"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/26/postgraduate-students-urge-funders-to-extend-grants-over-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/26/postgraduate-students-urge-funders-to-extend-grants-over-coronavirus", "title": "Postgraduate students urge funders to extend grants over coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:16:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>PhD and master\u2019s students worry their funding will run out as libraries and labs shut</p><p>PhD and master\u2019s students have <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oawtie1Y_zDMwDti6GCm82vNAMPPPZrXtaCMy7pI-3Q/edit?pli=1\">signed an open letter</a> asking to be given extensions to their funding by research councils so they can finish work disrupted by the coronavirus. <br><br>The letter, which has more than 1,000 signatories across UK universities, asks for research councils to urgently publish a plan outlining additional financial support for all postgraduate students.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/going-home-puts-my-parents-at-risk-students-hit-by-coronavirus-upheaval\">'Going home puts my parents at risk': UK students hit by coronavirus upheaval</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/26/postgraduate-students-urge-funders-to-extend-grants-over-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "PhD and master\u2019s students have \n asking to be given extensions to their funding by research councils so they can finish work disrupted by the coronavirus. \nThe letter, which has more than 1,000 signatories across UK universities, asks for research councils to urgently publish a plan outlining additional financial support for all postgraduate students.\nMany postgraduate students are currently unable to continue their research projects and theses because fieldwork has been halted and university labs and libraries are shut.

That, he added, means the dinosaur would have been able to whip its stiff tail around while pursing zig-zagging prey, meaning it was not only a nippy predator, but agile to boot. \nWhile the final moments of Dineobellator are lost to time, the team found a gouge in one of the animal\u2019s claws that appears to have been made around the time of its death \u2013 suggesting the beast may have met a sticky end. \u201cWe speculate an altercation with another Dineobellator or other predatory theropod resulted in these marks,\u201d they write.\nJasinksi noted that while dromaeosaurids were present in both Asia and North America about 125m years ago, there are few fossils from the period that followed, with more recent remains discovered primarily in Asia.\n\u201cIt looks like the ancestors of Dineobellator would have basically migrated from Asia and then diversified once they got back to North America at the very end of the Cretaceous, right before they went extinct,\u201d said Jasinski.\nJasinski said the findings emphasised there was still considerable diversity before the mass extinction, despite some arguing that dinosaurs were in decline. \u201cIt shows dromeosaurids were still basically evolving, they were still trying out new evolutionary pathways, new features, up to the very end,\u201d he said.\nDr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, agreed, adding that Dineobellator is the best fossil raptor dinosaur from southern North America during the very end of the age of dinosaurs, and one of the last surviving raptors.\n\u201cIn fact, it seems like there were many types of raptors in North America at this time, so they were really prospering,\u201d he said.\nThe creature would have been fearsome, he added. \u201cIf you saw it alive, Dineobellator would have looked like a weird, long-tailed, toothy bird \u2013 but one that could chase you down on foot and gut you with its claws.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ec8cd8746ab9a519cfc82d90d3d4ee0341a71b/0_0_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8bfb0d4de843058ff92e9de1619b444c"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/do-not-relax-covid-19-measures-in-wuhan-too-soon-scientists-warn": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/do-not-relax-covid-19-measures-in-wuhan-too-soon-scientists-warn", "title": "Do not relax Covid-19 measures in Wuhan too soon, scientists warn", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:37:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>Lifting restrictions in March could lead to new peak of cases in August, study suggests</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Relaxing physical distancing and school closures in Wuhan too soon could fuel a second wave of Covid-19 infections later in the year, scientists have said.</p><p>A study published in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30073-6/fulltext\">the Lancet</a> suggests lifting restrictions in March would lead to a surge in case numbers that would peak in August.

Schools have been closed ever since and only about 10% of the workforce \u2013 roughly corresponding to healthcare workers, police and other essential government staff \u2013 have been at work.\nThe study found that physical distancing measures were likely to be most effective if a staggered return to work were to start at the beginning of April, potentially reducing the median number of new infections by 24% up to the end of 2020 and delaying a second peak until October.\nKiesha Prem, also of the London School of Hygiene and the lead author, said: \u201cThe unprecedented measures the city of Wuhan has put in place to reduce social contacts in school and the workplace have helped to control the outbreak. However, the city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases.

They adapt in amazing ways.\u201d\nBut how profound are these changes? Are rats merely first-class opportunists and scavengers, or have they been changing at a genetic level as they adapt to modern life? To answer these questions, a team \u2013 co-led by Harpak \u2013 analysed the genomes of 29 New York rats which had been lured into traps filled with bacon, peanut butter and oats \u2013 favourite rodent treats in the Big Apple.\nThen the researchers compared the genomes of the city\u2019s rodents with those of nine brown rats from Heilongjiang province in north-east China, the original home of \n. Their findings \u2013 posted last week on \n \u2013 included a list of several dozen rat genes that showed major changes in DNA over the centuries as the species spread from Asia to Europe and on to America, and from the countryside into cities. These altered genes include those associated with diet, behaviour and movement, and reflect the ever-present need for rats to adapt to the challenges of living with humans in a city. The pressures include increased danger from disease and changes in diets, said the scientists, among them \n of San Francisco State University and Jason Munshi-South of Fordham University.\nOne gene highlighted by the team has been linked with changes in location behaviour. \u201cThis could reflect the fact that urban rats have to move through highly artificial environments that are very different from natural habitats,\u201d said Harpak. \u201cSo you could argue these gene changes might have evolved to help them move more easily through sewers and pipes.\u201d\nIn addition, the team also pinpointed changes to the gene CACNA1C, which has been repeatedly associated with psychiatric disorders in humans. They suggest that changes in rat behaviour, at a DNA level, may be occurring in response to changes in local predators, or to novel stimuli.\nThe crucial point, say the researchers, is that urban rats are so closely associated with human city-dwellers that it is possible similar genetic changes have occurred in both species. \u201cLike humans, rats live in higher densities in cities, leading to increased pathogen transmission potential,\u201d they argue. \u201cIn addition, mosquito species that have rapidly invaded urban areas across the world feed on both rats and humans \u2013 suggesting a novel, shared-disease exposure.\u201d\nThe most striking common feature of the lives of urban humans and urban rats is diet, the researchers discovered: both consume an increasingly large amount of highly processed sugars and fats. Such a diet leads to various health concerns, which could also apply to rats.\nExactly when brown rats went through most of these genetic changes is unclear. They could have been recent adaptations or could have occurred several hundred years ago.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know but we have plans to find out,\u201d said Harpak. His team is to test 125-year-old brown-rat pelts from a private collection in New York and analyse them to see if major changes had taken place by the end of 19th century or if they more recently. \u201cThat should give us a clearer indication of when these changes took place,\u201d he said.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2efae384513e84bdf9becda82c723ae599b078c6/65_17_2866_1720/master/2866.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a4d79ada77add5515b91283925234122"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/i-was-born-anxious-so-why-am-i-not-panicking-about-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/i-was-born-anxious-so-why-am-i-not-panicking-about-coronavirus", "title": "I was born anxious, but I'm coping with coronavirus \u2013 here's why | Adrian Chiles", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:10:13 GMT", "summary": "<p>As a teenager I had chronic hypochondria.

I was checking them several times a day, invariably finding lumps and bumps and various inconsistencies. My own doctor got fed up with it, so I started presenting myself, as a visiting patient, at several different GPs. I went to them on a rota, so they didn\u2019t get fed up, too. They never found anything but I remained in a right old state for years. And then one evening, in an Indian restaurant, my dad lost patience with my whimpering. He flung his naan bread down in irritation and said: \u201cLook Ade, you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re not going to die of ball-rot or anything else.\u201d The idea of ball-rot as a disease was absurd enough to snap me out of it. So that crisis passed, only to be replaced by another, and another.\nSo, I am a worrier. I have therapy for it; I swallow pills for it. I lie with my legs up against a wall, deep-breathing, with monks chanting on Spotify for it. But now, amid a global pandemic for God\u2019s sake, I just can\u2019t seem to worry enough. It turns out that the key component of my lifetime\u2019s anxiety has been paranoia: a conviction that I would be singled out for especially bad treatment. I would get ill and die of ball-rot younger than anyone else; my career would end in dismal failure while others succeeded; my football team would lose more than any other.\nBut with this, as it is the whole planet, my stupid head is less anxious than normal. I mean, I am still anxious about the end of civilisation, the looming economic depression and the deaths of people we love. But it hasn\u2019t sent me crazy like it\u2019s sending some friends over the edge. Perhaps it is just that everyone else is now as anxious as the anxious are all time.

They were told several people had fallen ill, and it was their job to piece together various fragments of information \u2013 about symptoms, timings and locations \u2013 to work out what might have happened.\nWe face the same challenge with every outbreak: we never have a single perfect dataset early on. Instead, we have to combine the information we do have to work out what might really be happening.\nThis week, a preliminary study from a team at the \n gained a lot of media attention, with headlines suggesting it implied the majority of people in the UK might have already been infected with Covid-19. Few would dispute that there are more cases in the UK than already reported; our group recently published a \n that suggested only 5\u20137% of people who\u2019ve fallen ill with Covid-19 have been recorded as confirmed cases in the UK data. But how plausible is it that there have been millions of infections out there that were very mild (or symptomless) and went undetected?\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what the Oxford team actually did. Its analysis focused on deaths in the UK and Italy. If we view the data in isolation, there are several scenarios that could potentially be consistent with the observed pattern of deaths. Perhaps there are lots of infections and a low severity. Or fewer infections and a higher severity.\nThe Oxford researchers suggested there were multiple scenarios that could explain the deaths reported in the UK, including those in which there have been a huge number of infections that haven\u2019t been detected. The media picked up on the most extreme of these scenarios, which implied the majority of the UK had already been infected. But remember, this analysis focused solely on deaths \u2013 and that\u2019s not the only data we have for Covid-19.\nThere are now several datasets that suggest many infections come with symptoms, particularly in older groups, and hence it is less likely that there are vast numbers of infections going undetected. Such datasets include testing on the \n, testing of passengers on \n, the \n of Covid-19 cases, and infections detected among \n.\nBased on these studies, it seems about 20\u201380% of people infected with Covid-19 could show symptoms. If this range turns out to be correct \u2013 and we combine it with our estimate that one in 15 people with symptoms are being reported \u2013 it would mean that hundreds of thousands of people in the UK have probably been infected with Covid-19 already, but not tens of millions. Of course, all these early studies have limitations in how the data was collected and what groups were being studied. To understand how much infection there has actually been, what we need are studies that collect blood samples from the wider population and test for previous exposure to Covid-19. As it happens, this was the key point made by the Oxford researchers in their paper, and it\u2019s one I fully agree with.\nThere is growing evidence that, on average, people who show Covid-19 symptoms have a 1\u20131.5% risk of death. This has been estimated in studies of data from \n, early \n, and the \n (with data adjusted to account for the older age of the cruise ship passengers). But this 1\u20131.5% risk just tells us what happens to people who have clear symptoms. If, as the above studies suggest, only 20\u201380% of infections come with symptoms, it would mean that for every 100,000 people who get infected with Covid-19, we would expect somewhere in the region of 200\u20131,200 deaths (ie between 100,000 x 20% x 1% and 100,000 x 80% x 1.5%).\nWe still don\u2019t know the exact risk, and we won\u2019t until we have the results from a large-scale analysis of blood samples. But the early pieces of information we do have suggest that this is an infection that can cause a large amount of severe disease, and the majority of the UK population are still susceptible to it.

As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers.\nAs with other coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, the UK\u2019s epidemic has progressed at different speeds across different regions. On Sunday, Dr KK Cheng, the director of the University of Birmingham\u2019s Institute of Applied Health Research, reported that 50 local authorities \n. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all national policy, we need to devolve power to our local authorities and their public health outbreak teams. As Dr Cheng pointed out, \u201cIt isn\u2019t rocket science. [Testing] does not even require personal protective equipment. Retired GPs, junior medical and nursing students will be delighted to contribute. Case numbers are doubling every four days. Every minute counts now.\u201d\nLarge-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus is power. Testing can help \n and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide evidence about regional variation and how the virus affects people of \n and genders. Virologists can use information about cases to monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural scientists whether their physical-distancing measures are working.\nTesting for the virus across the general population, in other words, can tell us whether our assumptions about coronavirus are correct. A new model from Prof Sunetra Gupta and a team of researchers at Oxford University, \n, reaches conclusions that are very different from the \n. Crucially, the Oxford model is not peer reviewed \u2013 so we can\u2019t be assured that its findings are correct \u2013 but Gupta suggests that \u201conly a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitalisable illness\u201d and that more than half the population have already been exposed to the virus, largely without symptoms. \nIf this were true, we could expect a big surge of hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks, but then the epidemic would recede, probably with no second wave. But to know whether this is actually the case, we urgently need immunity tests that will show whether people have had the virus.\nBy 10 March, the rates of reported Covid-19 virus tests were one for every 243 people in South Korea, 995 in Italy, 2,585 in the UK, and 38,695 in the USA. On 12 March, the UK government announced it would stop all community virus detection tests, and \n. By 16 March, when it realised the NHS faced a potential meltdown if the epidemic went unchecked, the government reversed its policy; rather than mitigating the virus, it returned to a strategy of suppression.\nPublic Health England is now reportedly increasing national laboratory \n, but up until now the UK has still only been testing 5,000 specimens per day. In contrast, the Irish government has set up 41 mobile test centres which are processing 100,000 samples per week for a population of 4.9 million (the UK\u2019s population is an estimated 66.4 million).\nEvery UK medical school and most large hospitals have labs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. These can amplify tiny genetic pieces of the virus from nasal swabs to indicate a positive test. Batches of 200 tests can be completed in a few hours. We don\u2019t yet have commercially standardised \u201cprimers\u201d (tools used to find the viral genetic pieces) but, with authorisation from government, labs could develop their own to provide an adequate service for now. If power is devolved to local labs, our local authority outbreak teams could rapidly escalate testing.\nThe announcement of \n in the UK is welcome. Around the world, companies are working frantically to develop diagnostic machines where people swabbing themselves can post samples to a lab. Others are using the Crispr-Cas9 genome editor to create a simple colour change on a test strip within 30 minutes. Either would be a game changer if they could be adopted at scale. People with symptoms would be able to self-isolate, identify contacts, report online to a national database, and the problem of mapping and rapidly quarantining those with coronavirus would be largely solved.\nSadly, home testing won\u2019t prevent the deluge of cases facing the \n in the next few weeks. But if the Imperial modellers are right and the epidemic returns after we achieve suppression, local authorities, using evidence from tests, could better control outbreaks and loosen the restrictions on our economy and our lives.\n Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed19d222b8d89155a49a00afde584c625d417f05/0_63_6595_3957/master/6595.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f2841e28d26299d4e89c71d463c0d8e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/search-coronavirus-cure-vaccine-pandemic": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/search-coronavirus-cure-vaccine-pandemic", "title": "Is it right to cut corners in the search for a coronavirus cure? | Julian Savulescu", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 11:01:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>Vaccine and drug trials are slow, to account for safety.

This race is split between two approaches: the trialling of pre-existing drugs used for similar diseases, and the \n. In both instances, important ethical decisions must be made. Is it OK to reassign a treatment that comes with side-effects? And with thousands dying from coronavirus every day, is it acceptable to cut corners in the search for a vaccine?\nLast Friday, the World Health Organization \n of Solidarity, a worldwide trial of the four most promising candidate treatments for Covid-19: \n, an antiretroviral treatment for Ebola; \n, both antimalarials; ritonavir, an HIV treatment; and interferon, a treatment for hepatitis C. Both Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle and China\u2019s Academy of Military Medical Sciences last week announced the start of human trials for new possible vaccines. Around 30 other research groups worldwide are working on vaccines.\nBut the WHO estimates that a vaccine won\u2019t be ready until June 2021. There are requirements that have to be observed. The gold standard for this kind of research is the clinical trial \u2013 administering the vaccine to a large number of people in controlled conditions and measuring its effect. Usually scientists wait 14 months to monitor effectiveness and possible side-effects \u2013 which is why we may have to wait until next summer. Coronavirus vaccine trials face the following dilemma: we need treatment quickly but we also need to know it will work. The worst outcome for the medical industry would be a vaccine that either did not work or, worse, was harmful or had side-effects. Globally, faith in vaccines is already at an all-time low.\nDecisions are taken by governments, in tandem with ethics committees. Every day they delay the development or introduction of an intervention found to be effective, a growing number will die. There have so far been 19,603 deaths, with 12% of those deaths occurring in a single day \u2013 yesterday (Tuesday 24 March). The economic devastation being wrought must also be considered \u2013 this will cost lives through depression, suicide and other effects of deprivation. In a pandemic, time is not only money. It is lives. Many lives.\nYet even promising possible treatments can prove to be ineffective or even harmful. Remdesivir, chloroquine, ritonavir and interferon all have serious side-effects, including heart arrhythmias and possibly death. Indeed, a \n after ingesting chloroquine, believing it would protect him from Covid-19.\nIn terms of vaccine discovery, there are plenty of ways authorities could speed up the process. One is a human challenge study. This involves deliberately infecting a person with coronavirus to look at how the virus behaves and using that evidence to find the most promising vaccines. Today, healthy people are deliberately infected with flu, common cold, typhoid, malaria, dengue fever and streptococcal infections to study the disease, and more rapidly develop vaccines and treatments.\nChallenge studies have been proposed in Covid-19. Hvivo, a clinical research group in London, has attracted more than \n \n with a milder coronavirus that does not cause serious symptoms. They will each be paid \u00a33,500. However, the utility of studying a related virus may be limited. There have been suggestions of challenge studies infecting younger participants at lower risk of complication with Covid-19. This comes with dangers and profound ethical implications \u2013 but could save thousands of lives. Another alternative would be to conscript low-risk people likely to be exposed to Covid-19 anyway to vaccine trials. A benefit of this would be to accrue a large sample group, so helping to indicate whether treatments could be rolled out to large populations. It is notable that \n will occur within a military installation: the suggestion is that trials may be conducted on soldiers without consent.\nThis war will require lines to be drawn: what level of uncertainty to accept, whether research can be done on unconscious patients without consent, what level of risk is justifiable, and so on. Currently these decisions are usually made by ethics committees using guidelines developed for non-pandemic situations. We require leadership from the government to push ahead scientific research around all treatment options, while ensuring reasonable risks. In my opinion, a failure by government to support this research is as wrong as implementing harmful policy.\nHow quickly we develop a treatment or a cure will depend on the risks we are prepared to take. So far, western countries have given greater priority to liberty and rights than eastern countries in responding to coronavirus, leaving them less able to secure public health. It is now, most likely, too late to eliminate the virus with isolation and quarantine. Scientific research looks the most promising option for a resolution to this pandemic.\nWe need to run the race by the rules in order to sufficiently protect human participants.

At UCLH, cancellations of elective cases have given doctors more time to help Covid-19 patients. Anaesthetists have tried to hold off using respirators for these patients until absolutely necessary, preferring less invasive methods instead.\nThis has used fewer resources and freed up anaesthetists and intensive care nurses who would otherwise be managing incubated patients. Our strategy appears to be working, at least for now. What is less clear is how we will prevent death and disability from other non-viral conditions during the outbreak.\nThough some would be forgiven for assuming coronavirus is now the only disease, the NHS still has to deal with myriad other illnesses alongside the pandemic. What will happen to\n, diabetes, heart disease and other medical conditions that still need managing?\nFor these patients, the knock-on effects of coronavirus could be devastating. A patient with end-stage cancer, who needs chemotherapy that could extend their life by a few months, may no longer get this treatment \u2013 as the chemotherapy could make them more susceptible to coronavirus. Oncologists have informed me that the \n amount to Hobson\u2019s choice \u2013 without chemotherapy, patients will likely die more quickly from their cancer, but they will still be less likely to die than if they contracted coronavirus while undergoing chemotherapy.\nAnd what about the cancer patients with better prospects - those who could have an operation and be \u201ccured\u201d? In the current viral climate, these patients are now deemed not \u201ctime critical\u201d enough to warrant their operations. They may remain stuck in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d, rather like flights not yet cleared for landing. They risk their cancers progressing \u2013 possibly even to an incurable state. And while these risks may be low, it\u2019s a lottery no patient wants to play.\nWhen this is all over, when the NHS has defeated this virus, when children are back to school, shops are reopened and cities are no longer \n, what will happen to the countless people who are still waiting for treatment? How does a previously overstretched NHS cope with managing these patients, in addition to those who will present with cancer and other non-viral illnesses during the coronavirus outbreak? The NHS will face one of the steepest backlogs of cases in its history.\nTo stem this backlog and ensure patients get the treatment they need, we should consider redistributing current resources to create hubs where oncologists and cancer surgeons could treat their urgent patients. Rather than basing the clinical priority of these patients on \n waiting targets, as has historically been the case, these doctors could instead triage patients according to the severity and risks of their disease.\nThough much of our focus now is rightly on coronavirus deaths, we risk losing sight of another wave of tragic fatalities \u2013 those who didn\u2019t have coronavirus, but didn\u2019t get the treatment they needed during this urgent crisis.\n Prasanna Sooriakumaran is a consultant urological surgeon at University College London Hospital\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914385f9c5adc913e863ad6c7fa7af5c445ac416/0_73_6591_3955/master/6591.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd82aa289addd8bd85afe3b5269da22a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/covid-19-is-natures-wake-up-call-to-complacent-civilisation": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/covid-19-is-natures-wake-up-call-to-complacent-civilisation", "title": "Covid-19 is nature's wake-up call to complacent civilisation | George Monbiot", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 06:00:51 GMT", "summary": "<p>A bubble has finally been burst \u2013 but will we now attend to the other threats facing humanity?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-live-news-india-lockdown-italy-cases-restrictions-uk-us-outbreak-australia-china-hubei-latest-updates\">Coronavirus: latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">All our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>We have been living in a bubble, a bubble of false comfort and denial.

Living behind screens, passing between capsules \u2013 our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls \u2013 we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards.\nNow the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished \n. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.\nThe planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them.\nA large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being \n, \n, \n and \n (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of \n). When we call such hazards \u201cbiblical\u201d, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us.\nIn his forthcoming book, \n, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become \n, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to \n across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into \n. Simultaneous \n \u2013 something that has never happened in the modern world \u2013 becomes highly likely.\nIn combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and \n, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps \n, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C.\nThanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don\u2019t need to change. When I challenge them, I\u2019m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven\u2019t experienced \n. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like \nis scarcely anywhere.\nBut this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on \n. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to \n.\nIn the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with \n, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the \n. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers.\nOur multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the \n, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. \u201cIt is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.\u201d In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts \u2013 the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths \u2013 it might cause.\nThe amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments \u2013 but at least they got there in the end.\nSunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life.\nThere are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who \n. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him.\nOr this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life.

Philippe [geddit?] was born on 29 February 2016. His parents decided to celebrate his first birthday 365 days later.\n28 February 2017.\nMy guess is that most of you got this question wrong. Certainly, my intuition when I first saw this problem was that the answer was March 1. If Feb 29 is the day after Feb 28 in leap years, it seems right that March 1 is the day after Feb 28 in non-leap years. This reasoning is erroneous. \nThink about it like this. In normal years, one day after Feb 28 is March 1, two days after Feb 28 is March 2, three days after Feb 28 is March 3, and so on until 365 days after Feb 28 is Feb 28.\nIn leap years, one day after Feb 29 is March 1, two days after Feb 29 is March 2, three days after Feb 29 is March 3, and so on. Clearly, 365 days after Feb 29 is also Feb 28!\n2. My great grandmother was born on the first Sunday of the year. Her seventh birthday was also on a Sunday.\nThe hint here was that in the set up to the question I said that leap years come around \u2018about\u2019 once every four years. A more accurate description is that the come around exactly every four years apart from years divisible by 100 (but not 400). So, 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 wasn\u2019t.\nIn a normal year, if a date falls on a Sunday one year, the following year that date falls on a Monday. So, for a date to fall on a Sunday one year, and a Sunday seven years later, we need a run of seven years with zero leap years. The last time this happened with the first Sunday of the year (i.e. one in January) was 1897-1904. So my great grandmother was born in 1897.\n3. The mother is 21 years older than her daughter. In six years she will be five times older than her daughter.\nWith the mother!\nLet\u2019s rewrite the statement of the question algebraically. Let M = age of mother now, and D = age of daughter now. Then\nSubstituting the first one in the second:\n5D + 30 = D + 21 + 6\nwhich is\n4D = \u20133, or D = \u20133/4 years. In other words the daughter is aged -9 months. She is being conceived!\nI hope you enjoyed today\u2019s problems.

Today, it is readily available on most devices except, oddly enough, smart TVs. If anything, there\u2019s a plethora of services, and I haven\u2019t tried most of them. The options include Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook, FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, Skype and many more. Zoom is a business service but it works well and is clearly flavour of the month, with \n. Fake backgrounds are one of its winning features.\nIn this case, I recommend going with whatever you know best. You\u2019re probably going to have to do remote telephone support and the more familiar you are with a system, the easier that will be. If you can get the same equipment at both ends, even better. If you have to start from scratch, try it out with someone else and find the tricky bits before involving grandma.\nI can understand the appeal of the \n because it is designed for the job. The smart cameras and tracking are far better than you get in most home speaker-type devices. You can make video calls via WhatsApp as well as Facebook Messenger, and it has Amazon\u2019s Alexa built in. The drawbacks are that it involves using Facebook, it is expensive, and you are bound to have privacy concerns. (I assume grandma isn\u2019t using Facebook now as you\u2019d probably have tried Facebook Messenger as the most obvious option.)\nThe version that could swing it for some people is \n (\n), which doesn\u2019t have a screen. It plugs into your TV set and works with its own small remote as well as its \u201cHey Portal\u201d voice control.\nGoogle\u2019s \n (\n) is similar to the standalone Portal. It has a good 6.5 megapixel camera, a 10in screen and a voice-controlled Google Assistant, but it also comes with privacy concerns. They all do.\nFortunately, there is an alternative that I can recommend and use myself: Amazon\u2019s Alexa-powered Echo Show. At least with \n I\u2019m a paying customer, whereas Google and Facebook make most of their money from surveillance-based advertising. I think it\u2019s the lesser of three evils, but the final choice is up to you.\nThere are three Echo Show options with \n (\n), 8in (\n) and \n (\n) screens. Bigger screens are better, but the 8in version is the best value for money and, in my experience, the 5in model works well enough.\nYou set up an Alexa Show from a smartphone app and give it access to your contacts list. After that you will be able to make calls by saying \u201cAlexa, call grandma\u201d. Alexa can also call most numbers that are not in your contacts list if you spell them out (\u201cAlexa, call 0 2 0 8\u2026).\nAlexa performs many other useful functions, too. These include weather reports, playing radio stations or individual songs (if available), doing conversions (\u201cAlexa, what\u2019s 37 degrees in Fahrenheit?\u201d), answering general knowledge questions (though not nearly as well as \n Assistant), telling Dad jokes, and playing simple games. You can easily provide grandma with a list of things to say, and Amazon will email you suggestions on a regular basis.\nAlexa can read books and stories, including books from an Amazon Audible account. She can also control other home devices, such as lights, if you have any that are compatible. If you have an Amazon Prime account, an Alexa Show can play Amazon Prime videos.\nFinally, Alexa devices \u2013 like Portals and Nest Hubs \u2013 are always plugged into the mains, so grandma never has to think about recharging them.\nIf you decide to buy a tablet instead, an Amazon Fire HD is a good choice for your purposes, and the best value for money. There are two HD models with 8in (\n) and 10in (\n) screens, and a non-HD model with a \n (\n). The 8in version is \u201c\n\u201d, but I think it\u2019s worth paying more \n. This has a faster processor, a sharper 1920 x 1200-pixel screen, twice as much storage, better battery life (up to 12 hours) and a USB-C port. I\u2019d also pay the extra \u00a310 to remove the Amazon promotions.\nFire HD tablets have Alexa, so grandma would be able to use the same video calling system as with an Alexa Show. The drawbacks are that it\u2019s not as convenient as an always-on Alexa, will need charging often, and has comparatively poor speakers.\nA 5in Alexa Show works well as a bedside clock-radio alarm, and the larger versions work well as kitchen radios. With a Fire HD, you\u2019d need to add an accessory stand and an external speaker. (Amazon\u2019s \n will prop it up for \u00a339.99, but I\u2019d rather have the old \n, which converted a Fire HD 10 into an Echo Show. See below\u2026)\nThe Fire HD also has the advantage of providing tablet apps, so grandma could do her emails, browse Facebook, play games and other things. There are plenty of casual games suitable for seniors, and it\u2019s not too late for her to become addicted to Candy Crush or Bejeweled. You could also play Words With Friends with her.\nTechnically, Amazon\u2019s Fire OS is a fork of Android, but it has more than enough apps and games. The apps include \n, \n and \n.\nApple\u2019s FaceTime is a great way to make video calls. Its major drawback is that it only runs on Apple kit. If you had an iPhone or an iPad, then I expect you\u2019d already have decided to buy grandma an iPad. If I\u2019m wrong and you are an Apple user, you can buy an iPad with a 10.2in screen for \n.\nUnfortunately, if you have to buy new iPads for both ends, then approximately \u00a3700 is not a cheap solution compared with roughly \u00a3200 for two Echo Shows, or one Echo Show and your current smartphone.\nOf course, iPads can do thousands of things besides making video calls, and grandma would find many of them useful or entertaining. If grandma didn\u2019t want to use FaceTime for some reason, iPads support many other video calling systems, including \n. They also have more and better apps than Android and Amazon tablets.\nThere are a zillion Android tablets, and you can save a lot of money by buying \u201coff brand\u201d products. Nevertheless, I\u2019d go for a mainstream Samsung Galaxy Tab, one of the Huawei MediaPad range, or a Lenovo SmartTab. From what I\u2019ve seen \u2013 which isn\u2019t all of them \u2013 they are well made and they have good quality screens at reasonable prices.\nA geek could spend a long time pondering the selfie camera resolution, processor speed, storage and so on. I don\u2019t expect any of those will matter much for grandma\u2019s purposes.

Facebook Messenger? \n? Skype? Google Hangouts? FaceTime?\n Well, that\u2019s to be expected. Now we\u2019re all under lockdown, we get to witness all the big video-calling apps fight each other to the death for dominance. By the time \n is over, at least one of these services will end up as the video-conferencing version of \n.\nUnlikely. As things stand, Facebook Messenger is the only app that has a filter that turns your head into a foot. People need that sort of thing these days.\n Again, probably not.

With groups of up to 100, you get 40 minutes free. After that, it\u2019s \u00a311.99 a month to run a call.\n No it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s brilliant.\n Have you done any video-conferencing yet? It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s full of people talking over each other, or muttering, or standing in noisy rooms that drown out all conversation. Also, no one seems to know how to satisfactorily end a video call. They go on and on and on. I think 40 minutes is plenty.\nWell, that and the pornography.\nAh, \n, where trolls join a video chat and, instead of showing their face, broadcast pornography to everyone else in the group.\nYes \u2013 but, simultaneously, much less boring than a 9am work meeting.\n At least until the stay-at-home rules are lifted and everyone can just go to the pub again. Frankly, that can\u2019t come quickly enough.\n No, because I hate interaction! The past few days have been a nightmare! Everyone keeps checking in on me! I\u2019ve spoken to more people in the past 48 hours than in the two months before that combined! Why does everyone have to see each other all the time? What\u2019s wrong with a text?\n Yes!

As they became immersed in email and the nascent worldwide web, it was rumoured that the most modern people were increasingly removed from even their friends and families \u2013 something crystallised in Douglas Coupland\u2019s 1995 novel \n, which moves from Microsoft\u2019s HQ near Seattle to Silicon Valley.\nMidway through the book comes an angst-ridden email written by one of the key characters. \u201cSo many people no longer have lives that you raeally [sic] have to wonder if some new mode of existence is being created which is going to become so huge that it is no longer on the moral scale \u2013 simply the way people ARE,\u201d he says. \u201cI only need 2 hours of people a day. I can get by on that amount. 2 hours of FaceTime.\u201d\nAs a pointer to the future, it was hardly misplaced. There is grim symbolism in the fact that \u201cFaceTime\u201d eventually lost its original meaning, and became the name of the video-phoning app launched by Apple in 2010 \u2013 ironically enough, a mere approximation of face time in its original sense. But in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, this is how millions of us, of all ages, are living.\nFor the foreseeable future, ours is a world in which extended, in-person social contact is simply reckless, and the replacement of socialising with time spent online is an everyday fact. And beyond all those newly ubiquitous platforms for video calling and conferencing, arguably our single greatest collective tool is also the one people like me have spent the last four years maligning as increasingly monstrous, out-of-control, badly led, central to many countries\u2019 journeys away from liberal democracy, and damagingly addictive to boot.\nFor Facebook and its senior management, all those things remain in play. Beyond the current pandemic, the company\u2019s culture and practices are being tested once again \n. But life is never without contradictions and ambivalences, and we all know the positive things Facebook can facilitate, arguably as never before. The Covid-19 moment demands a means of bringing people together while they largely stay in their homes, and ensuring that whatever limited time they can spend in the real world is used as constructively as possible. Given that 2.5 billion human beings have Facebook accounts, the solution has arrived as a matter of inevitability.\nFacebook\u2019s PR people are keen to big up its new \n that puts reliable material about the virus at the top of people\u2019s news feeds. Its moderating machine, they emphasise, is aggressively tackling misinformation about the virus \u2013 though its systems have already mistakenly \n, and the weeks to come will surely test them to the limit. Facebook-owned WhatsApp is another means of communication that the outbreak has made indispensable, although there are questions to be asked about the \n people are using it to spread.\nBut here is some unalloyed good news: in the UK alone, Facebook has facilitated the formation of an estimated 300 local \n, whose combined membership now totals more than a million people.\nLate last week, I spoke to Edd Withers, a 33-year-old resident of Canterbury, who is one of three administrators of a \n called Canterbury Residents. It was founded in 2014, with the intention of bringing together a small university city, and \u201cbridging the gap between the student population and the resident population \u2013 getting over this kind of clash of worlds\u201d. The group now has 37,000 members. \u201cIt\u2019s had a massive impact on the whole way the city learns and communicates about news, and what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.\nThe group has now spawned a Facebook offshoot called Canterbury Coronavirus Assistance, which has gained more than 1,000 members in a week. In the immediate moment, Withers told me, lots of people were volunteering to run errands and check in on others. \u201cBut there will still be people who are self-isolating in six months\u2019 time. Things might calm down, but there will still be really vulnerable people feeling the effects of all this.\u201d He emphasised how important it is that these assistance networks operate safely: \u201cIt\u2019s not about going in gung-ho and introducing stranger A to vulnerable person B.\u201d With that in mind, he and his colleagues are linking people to already-existing local charities and community organisations. Via a \n chat group, he is also being advised by a group of wise heads that includes the leader of the council, and representatives of local churches.\nWhatever Facebook\u2019s serial transgressions, there is something at the heart of such initiatives that holds out the prospect of a kind of social organisation beyond the \u201ctraditional\u201d state and the paternalism of charity. It is one of the most remarkable sociological aspects of this crisis that as so many of life\u2019s fundamentals fall away, this is the one kind of human interaction that will be strengthened. And yes, there is a cruelty in the fact that as so many large and small businesses hit the wall, Facebook and the other titans of big tech will probably emerge from this crisis even more powerful. This issue was pre-emptively answered by Facebook\u2019s decision \n; but the problem will still likely flare up again as the economic crisis triggered by the virus deepens.\nIn early 2017, amid the first stirrings of a conversation about Facebook\u2019s mismatch of power and responsibility that would go nuclear later that year, Mark Zuckerberg began to \n. He talked about \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, and how important it is to feel \u201ccomfort that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us\u201d. In his \n, he sounded positively evangelical: \u201cChange starts local. Even global changes start small \u2013 with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this \u2013 your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.\u201d\nVery quickly, this stuff felt like so much cover for the arrogance and oversights that would be decisively revealed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But in the midst of such awful global events and the way millions are responding to them, Zuckerberg\u2019s words also just about ring true, and underline what Facebook enables millions of us to do. Sooner or later, we will have to resume the conversation about whether the company \u2013 along with the other tech giants \u2013 should exist in its current form, whether to forcibly pull its social functions away from advertising, and all the rest. But for now, our world is inescapably cast in its corporate blue and white, and millions of us know one thing as a matter of daily experience: that without it, even more things might fall apart.\n John Harris is a Guardian columnist\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c9a6a39fc41c9b571d465f03758bb3cccd5352/90_158_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=542a18d69b5ffa0ecb6939f5339b000e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/22/old-techs-new-wave-or-why-we-still-love-faxes-pagers-and-cassettes": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/22/old-techs-new-wave-or-why-we-still-love-faxes-pagers-and-cassettes", "title": "Old tech\u2019s new wave, the gadgets of yesteryear making a comeback", "published": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 12:30:06 GMT", "summary": "<p>Once seen as cutting edge, many of yesterday\u2019s gadgets are \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 still in use or are making a comeback.

You might imagine that the text message would have killed the pager. PageOne, the country\u2019s remaining service provider, stresses that the pager remains the most reliable and cost-effective way of sending out thousands of messages at a time, with far greater coverage than the mobile phone network (including on aeroplanes). Fire and ambulance services use them widely, with the NHS accounting for an estimated 10% of use worldwide \u2013 thanks to the 130,000 or so doctors who use them while on call. Many doctors say it\u2019s quicker and easier paging in emergency situations \u2013 mobile reception is patchy in many hospitals and paging doesn\u2019t interfere with electric equipment \u2013 and if it ain\u2019t broke, why fix it?\nNo gadget encapsulates the turn against the tech companies better than Glass, the eye-mounted computer launched by Google with great fanfare in 2013. It was sunk almost immediately amid privacy concerns and snarky people calling early adopters \u201cGlassholes\u201d. But it has an afterlife as a medical research tool. An MIT start-up called Brain Power builds software for Glass that helps children with autism and ADHD to build socio-emotional skills. Google also expanded its Glass at Work programme, which seeks business applications for the device.\nThe resurgence of vinyl is well-documented \u2013 records now outsell CDs \u2013 but last year, cassette tapes also surged to 19% growth in the US. OK, we\u2019re talking low baseline \u2013 from 99,400 to 118,200, a far cry from the mid-1990s when sales hit hundreds of millions. But the magnetic cassette is establishing a niche. The American company National Audio manufactures 18m blank cassettes annually, selling to 3,500 record labels across the world. \n, launched at \n in London in 2013 in response to the resounding success of \n, has since become an international event. Tapes are prized because they are affordable, easy to use and personal in a way that Spotify playlists are not. If you cannot imagine how you might have otherwise found a girlfriend/boyfriend without mixtapes, it is cheering.\nAmerica is supposedly the world\u2019s leader in all things financial, but its retail banking systems look mediaeval to travellers from Europe, Africa and Asia. Direct bank transfers and online payments have been slow to catch on, chip and pin is seen as witchcraft, and cheques are still widely used. A 2018 study by the Federal Reserve found that consumers used cheques for 10% of purchases \u2013 more than electronic payments, which accounted for 8.9%.\nThe UK government has been more proactive in phasing out cheques \u2013 but has still met fierce resistance from banks and customers (elderly people like them, so do charities). Cheques still accounted for \u00a3550bn worth of spending in 2018, the year the UK Payments Council had promised to phase them out by. Instead, the UK Payments Council has itself been phased out. Its replacement, \n, promises to phase them out under the New Payments Architecture project, due in 2024, at the earliest.\nThe stand-alone dictaphone, ideally reel-to-reel, remains an essential item for most journalists \u2013 despite apps that do the same thing on phones. The dictaphone is seen as more reliable. It doesn\u2019t stop recording when you take a call. It\u2019s easier to transcribe. And it doesn\u2019t do that heart-stopping thing where you hit \u201csave\u201d and your file disappears into the Cloud. \u201cSomething about the specific purpose of dictaphones, as opposed to a phone\u2019s multiple functions, makes them feel more secure,\u201d says one hack.\nThe same is true for many of the functions supposedly outsourced to phones. Accountants remain attached to calculators. \u201cMuch quicker than opening an app for a quick sum and more pleasant to use,\u201d says one accountant. Walkers refuse to forego real maps \u2013 Ordnance Survey reports growing sales for both paper and digital versions \u2013 and the \n doesn\u2019t lose reception on the Tube. An actual alarm clock doesn\u2019t bombard you with irritating messages when you wake up.\nThe Nokia 3310 was the AK-47 of mobile phones \u2013 ubiquitous, utilitarian, nigh on indestructible. Introduced by Nokia in 2000, it soon became one of the world\u2019s most popular mobile phones, selling over 120m. Its chat feature and built in \u201capplications\u201d \u2013 such as a calculator! \u2013 were considered revolutionary. Then it secured affection thanks to the game \n. But its week-long battery life and sheer durability made it a long-term winner \u2013 until Apple decided to make phones out of glass and overload them with apps so the batteries run out in a day.\nThe Nokia 3310 was relaunched in 2017 to widespread acclaim and ushered in a new wave of \u201cdumbphones\u201d or \u201cfeature phones\u201d. Their cheapness, battery life and durability are key selling points \u2013 particularly in India, the Middle East and Africa \u2013 while westerners are embracing them as a cure for distraction.\nThe term \u201cTamagotchi effect\u201d was coined in 1997 to describe the complex emotional relationships that humans form with machines. It took its name from the Japanese virtual pet craze that inspired millions of children (and adults) to nurture digital aliens on egg-shaped devices in the hope that they would evolve into an adorable Mametchi \u2013 and hopefully not a stinky Tarakotchi. At the time, there were reports of bereft schoolchildren burying dead Tamagotchis in graveyards or skipping school to keep their Tamagotchis alive. Recent relaunches have failed to revive the craze, but there remains a devoted Tamagotchi community on the website \n. \u201cI find that whenever I need to do something a little bit stressful or daunting, I tend to start up a new or old virtual pet as a way of getting through it,\u201d one user told the \n last year.\nDVDs: who needs them? Well, Netflix announced that it had made $200m from its video rental business in the US, where 2.7 million of its customers still elect to receive DVDs through the post. The streaming giant started life as a DVD rental company in America (LoveFilm, now owned by Amazon, occupied the niche in the UK) and apparently has no plans to abandon the service until at least 2025. One reason is that internet coverage is so unreliable in rural areas. But might the poor selection of films on Netflix and other streaming services also help nurture demand?\nDVD rental shops are still relatively common in Paris where \n and \nare prized by cin\u00e9philes who point to a lack of decent movie streaming sites. And a few well-loved establishments cling on in the UK. Bristol\u2019s \n, for example, hires out its screening room for parties and film clubs, and its staff recommendations beat an algorithm any day.\nThere is still a strong school of thought on news desks that dictaphones themselves are an unnecessary encumbrance \u2013 never mind iPhones or fancy AI transcription apps. Pete Clifton, the editor-in-chief of PA, Britain\u2019s largest news agency, recently announced that a shorthand speed of 100 words per minute was an \u201cabsolute requirement\u201d. \u201cAny application without it goes straight in the bin,\u201d he told \n. Not only is it essential for court reporting \u2013 where reporters are forbidden from making recordings \u2013 but Clifton also asserted: \u201cAny reporter who can take a rapid note on the doorstep, then read it straight back to the news desk or write it into a story, is always going to beat someone who has to listen back to a recording.\u201d\nThe NHS is reckoned to be the world\u2019s foremost purchaser of fax machines \u2013 9,000 were still in use in 2018. Matt Hancock, health secretary, has demanded that trusts stop using the \u201carchaic\u201d devices by the end of this month, citing inefficiencies and security risks. Still, if you\u2019ve ever sat in your GP\u2019s surgery while they refer you to a hospital appointment, you will know that a fax remains the communication device of choice.\nBut once a particular technology is embedded, it\u2019s not so straightforward to remove. In Japan, millions of faxes are still sent daily to apply for job interviews, send restaurant orders ahead and RSVP to parties. Japan is a famously tech-forward nation. It also has three alphabets and an ageing population, many of whom find it easier to write the characters out by hand. Rather endearingly, the art critic \n wrote all his reviews by typewriter and faxed them to the \n until he died in 2015.\nKodak is arguably the most famous casualty of the digital era. The once giant company continued to push analogue film cameras long after its competitors had moved on \u2013 and collapsed as a result.\nSales of camera film dropped from nearly 1bn rolls per year in 2003 to about 20m last year. However, like vinyl and cassette, the market has stabilised and 35mm photographic film has witnessed a mini-revival among the Instagram generation, many of whom are rooting around in their parents\u2019 attics in search of unused rolls and frantically bidding on eBay for affordable cameras. When everyone else is applying the same digital filters, you can make your photos stand out by using film. \u201cIt\u2019s honest and unprejudiced, not simply a part of the batch of replicas that digital photography can produce,\u201d writes one enthusiast. Meanwhile, an unlikely secondary market has developed in used film, which can go for up to \u00a3100 on eBay. Fans develop the mystery rolls and share the often disquieting results on the Reddit forum \n.\nPolaroid was the Apple of its day. The SX-70 collapsible instant camera, unveiled by Edwin Land in 1972, was an instant revolution in photography. It was camera and dark room in one. Andy Warhol made \n central to his process, as did David Hockney with Polaroid \u201cjoiners\u201d. Until digital cameras appeared in the 1990s, a Polaroid was the only way you could see what you\u2019d just snapped instantly. The original corporation went bankrupt in 2001 and the company that took on the Polaroid brand went bankrupt in 2008. But the technology lives on under the Polaroid Originals brand and has found a whole new audience, especially when rephotographed with a digital camera and popped up on Instagram. The hip-hop photographer \n has won an avid following for her Polaroids. Digital age gratification + analogue age authenticity = an irresistible combination.\nThe basic text message or SMS (short messaging system) has been steadily falling out of use in the smartphone era from a global peak of 8tr messages per year in 2012. We are still messaging each other \u2013 more than ever \u2013 it\u2019s just that we\u2019re mostly using OTT (over-the-top) services like Messenger, Telegram and WhatsApp.\nHowever, texts have been having a mini-resurgence: Three UK, for example, reports a 30% increase in text volumes last year. With lots of us on different apps, a text message is usually the safest way to ensure your message arrives with the requisite \u201cping\u201d. It\u2019s one reason SMS is increasingly popular with marketers and businesses. According to one commercial survey, 90% of texts are read within three minutes; texts have a 209% higher response rate than phone, email or Facebook; more people can receive texts than any other type of message; and people are just happier to receive them, too. The Future Laboratory describes SMS as \u201cthe surprising underdog as brands are looking for other ways to grab people\u2019s attention\u201d. More personal than a chatbot too. So prepare to receive a lot more marketing texts in the next few years.\nThere are still 10,000 or so red telephone boxes on Britain\u2019s streets, including Sir Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s 1924 Kiosk 2 prototype, which you will find outside the Royal Academy on Piccadilly in London. The K2 was voted the greatest British design of all time in 2015. But what is to be done with them in the age of the smartphone? Some have found new life as mini-libraries, many house defibrillators, others are used as coffee stands and most are purely decorative. But given the excess supply and declining demand, why are thousands of brand new phone kiosks being built? InLinks kiosks, which combine advertising screens, CCTV, public wifi and surveillance technology, are now a common sight in London. They are made by a consortium of BT, advertising company Primesight and \u201csmart cities\u201d firm Intersection, which is owned by Alphabet. Archaic planning laws make it hard for councils to object. Citizens may not need phone boxes \u2013 but surveillance capitalists do.\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re nostalgic for the days when telephone boxes were handsome, useful items of street furniture, you can buy a K6 box for \u00a32,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT\u2019s approved reseller \n.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc49aa4d4c04b3c46252198e8e7d041d295a976/2967_0_3450_4108/master/3450.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fb785253165b90857aeabf259fba58e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/21/working-from-home-tech-self-isolation": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/21/working-from-home-tech-self-isolation", "title": "Working from home: your guide to the tech you're going to need", "published": "Sat, 21 Mar 2020 09:00:33 GMT", "summary": "<p>With many people facing a long stint of self-isolation, remote working needs to be as easy as possible</p><p>With the coronavirus pandemic resulting in more and more of us being asked to work remotely, it\u2019s time to get to grips with what\u2019s required for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-at-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating\">working from home for more than just a day at a time</a>.</p><p>Broadly speaking you have two options: a desktop computer or a laptop.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/21/working-from-home-tech-self-isolation\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "With the coronavirus pandemic resulting in more and more of us being asked to work remotely, it\u2019s time to get to grips with what\u2019s required for \n.\nBroadly speaking you have two options: a desktop computer or a laptop.\nDesktop computers have a few advantages, with one big downside: you can\u2019t easily move them.\nThe upsides are they are typically cheaper, can often be upgraded fairly easily and cheaply, and lower-cost desktops will likely age better than their laptop counterparts in terms of performance.\nMost modern desktops will be able to handle general office work. They come in two types: towers, to which you attach a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and all-in-ones, which are computers built into the back of screens, such as Apple\u2019s iMac and Windows PC equivalents.\nSome basic specs should include:\n Processor: look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7, AMD\u2019s Ryzen 5 2500 or Intel\u2019s i3 at the lowest end\n RAM: 8GB minimum\n Storage: an SSD with 256GB of storage minimum, some machines may also come with large capacity traditional HDD too\nLook for a discrete graphics card made by Nvidia or AMD if you work in a creative content industry, such as photo or video editing or similar.\nThe big advantage of a laptop \u2013 portability \u2013 has one big downside: terrible ergonomics making you hunch over which is bad for your back, shoulders and wrists. Consider varying your working position and height during the day, from sitting at a desk or kitchen table to standing at a kitchen work surface.\nThere is a massive range in laptops including traditional hinged laptops, 2-in-1s where the keyboard folds all the way round the back and convertibles where the screen detaches from the keyboard to turn into a tablet.\nBroadly speaking traditional laptops will be cheaper. You should look for a ninth or 10th-generation Intel i5 or i7 processor, at least 8GB of RAM (preferably 16GB if an option) and 256GB of SSD storage \u2013 do not buy a laptop that only has a traditional hard drive, and nothing below 128GB. \nIn addition you have to consider the screen, keyboard and trackpad. A 13in to 14in screen will be fine for most uses, so look out for a resolution of at least 1080p (1920 x 1200 or similar). The higher the resolution the crisper the screen will look.\n with poor keyboards or a poor trackpad can be infuriating to use, so check reviews before you buy. If you\u2019re really price constrained and do all your work in browser, consider a Chromebook which will offer a much better experience at the low end than an equally cheap Windows laptop.\nYou can use a riser or a pile of books to bring laptops up to eye-level, or attach them to an external monitor, and connect a keyboard and mouse to improve ergonomics.\nIf you\u2019re buying a tower desktop you need a monitor, which come in a vast array of sizes, resolutions and prices. \nUp to 24in Full HD, 1080p or similar resolution should be fine, although Quad HD, 1440p or similar will look crisper. Larger monitors benefit greatly from increased resolution with QHD being a minimum at 27in or above, and 4K monitors being a luxury.\nLook for a monitor with height adjustment, and position the top of the screen at eye level. If your monitor doesn\u2019t offer height adjustment consider a third-party stand if VESA compatible (the manual or specs should tell you) or carefully propping it up on a riser or stack of books.\nKeyboards too range in price from the fairly cheap to the designer expensive. If you type for a living it\u2019s worth investing in a good keyboard. They come in USB or wireless versions, which are now typically connect via the Bluetooth available in the vast majority of modern laptops and desktops.\nWireless keyboards are neater but normally require batteries, so make sure you buy some rechargeable batteries to fit them. Most will last months on a set of AA or AAAs.\nSome people swear by mechanical keyboards, which look like they should ship with PCs from the 1990s and require more physical action on the keys to activate, while others like scissor-switch keyboards that are shallower and more like those on a laptop. Stick to whichever type you\u2019re comfortable with.\nDon\u2019t forgot a mouse too. Avoid fancy-looking flat ones and consider a more ergonomically shaped one or a vertical mouse to help with wrist pain.\nAfter the computer and desk set up, noise cancelling headphones might be the next best tip, particularly useful if your home office is more like the kitchen table. They\u2019re also useful for video conferencing or phone calls, as most have built-in microphones.\nThe best in the business are the Bose QC35 II, but most large, over ear headphones will help. \nWebcams might seem like an antiquated suggestion, but with video conferencing being in vogue, if you\u2019re using desktop with separate monitor you might have to buy one. Thankfully they range from about \u00a320 and up, with higher-priced models aimed at streamers.\nNow you\u2019ve got your hardware sorted, it\u2019s time to think about software. You may have tools provided by your employer, if not there are plenty of free and easy-to-use pieces of software, so here are some suggestions:\nIf you need to word process or handle spreadsheets, Google\u2019s online Docs suite works fantastically in a browser. Alternatives include Microsoft\u2019s free Office online or Apple\u2019s free Pages and Sheets on a Mac.\nMost computers will come with basic image editing built-in, such as Microsoft\u2019s Photos and Apple\u2019s Preview or Photos. The free GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is powerful but fairly complex. Paint.Net is fairly feature-packed but simple on Windows, and Google Photos in a browser can handle basic photo improvement jobs.\nChances are you\u2019re going to end up using what your employer provides, such as Zoom, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams and so on The main consumer tools are Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Google\u2019s Duo and Apple\u2019s Face Time, the last of which only works on Apple devices. Most phone-based messaging apps, including Signal, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, also offer video chat, which can be easier to use.\nYes. And it\u2019s all thanks to streamers like Netflix. That\u2019s because, according to BT, everyone working from home consumes less bandwidth than the evening peak of everyone streaming TV, downloading games and other bandwidth intensive tasks.\nHoward Watson, BT\u2019s chief technology and information officer, said: \u201cEven if the same heavy data traffic that we see each evening were to run throughout the daytime, there is still enough capacity for work-applications to run simultaneously.\u201d\nJust because the nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure can cope, doesn\u2019t mean your own home broadband won\u2019t need a little TLC. There are several things to consider:\nYou might find that a slow broadband package isn\u2019t enough when shared between everyone working and streaming at home all at the same time. It\u2019s not just the download speed either as work video conferencing, file transfers and so on can be demanding on the often significantly slower upload speeds.\nYou may need to pay for a faster package, or stop the kids streaming while you\u2019re working.\nYour router is a tiny, cheap computer and it gets old like anything else. If you haven\u2019t had your router replaced in the last six years, you could probably do with a new one, which will help with wifi speedand also range. Contact your service provider.\nWifi strength and speed diminishes the further you are from your router. You may need to move the router to the middle of the house if you can.\nIf you can\u2019t, wifi range extenders (\u00a330 and up) or powerline networking (\u00a360 and up), using the electrical wires as surrogate ethernet cables, can help.\nFailing that, mesh networking is your expensive, but powerful friend, replacing your router\u2019s wifi with a series of nodes that send wifi all over the house. Whole-home systems start at about \u00a3150 and scale to \u00a3400 for the very best.\nIt sounds daft in 2020 to say this, but yes. Cheap routers can get befuddled for any number of reasons, particularly if pushed hard. Turn off your router at the wall or switch, wait at least 20 seconds, then switch it back on.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b265cf86bf9cb831e8714366a2c575807448b78/0_177_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15b02e6313047e1c6433ae0271b486b8"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19", "title": "'The perfect time to start': how book clubs are enduring and flourishing during Covid-19", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:45:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the world goes into lockdown, reading groups are moving to Zoom, Twitter and Instagram to bring readers together</p><p>\u2022 Scroll down for a list of book clubs you can join</p><p>My book club was the first to concede defeat.

We had not even settled on our next book yet, such was our preemptive commitment to self-isolation. As our host said, the book club had already been in quarantine for months.\nAs the Covid-19 crisis has confined us to our homes, a sliver of a silver lining (entirely inadequate, of course, but we look for them all the same) is that it has provided a chance to catch up on our reading. Being mostly solitary and indoors, it is one of the few pursuits that remain unchanged in this new world, while affording us access to others. With every connected device a potential portal for anxiety, it may never have felt so necessary to escape into the printed word.\n People have started sharing pictures of books they have stockpiled for self-isolation under the hashtag #CoronavirusReadingStack. \u201cPanic buying,\u201d \n. \u201cDo I have enough books to last?\u201d \n as though her library choices were toilet paper.\nThe internet has allowed new book clubs to form, in spite of self-isolation and lockdowns. In the US, \n offers readers the chance to \u201ctalk to authors without touching anyone\u201d, holding live online Q&As ($5 for a login link). In the UK, \n have launched a fortnightly book club and upped the frequency of their live author talks to stream on YouTube twice a week, after observing an increase of 20% in viewers. German tennis player Andrea Petkovic \n (their first pick was String Theory by tennis-fan \n).\nOn Twitter, \n has already recruited hundreds to his global read-along of \n, under the hashtag \n. Some participants have even purchased extra copies of the book for those who cannot afford them.\n\u201cLiterature has always done such an extraordinary job of provoking community and conversation \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise to me that it should be doing so, so powerfully now,\u201d says Macfarlane.\nLondoner Tania Hardcastle had been meaning to start a book club for a while before coronavirus cleared her schedule: \u201cI thought it would be the perfect time to start.\u201d\nShe and her friends Sharlene Gandhi and Priya Shah received such a response to\n \u2013 including from \n, the author of the first book they chose, \n \u2013 that they had to cap membership at 15 people. Their planned Google hangout \u201cmight become unmanageable otherwise,\u201d says Hardcastle.\nCommunities have not just formed online; they have migrated there. \u201cReal life\u201d book clubs more disciplined than mine have already relocated to virtual meeting rooms such as Google Hangouts, or the suddenly ubiquitous video-conferencing platform \n.\nSarah West, an academic based in York, has hosted her seven-person book club around her dining table each month, for three years. Last Monday, they gathered to discuss \n on Zoom. After initial hellos \u2013 \u201cso that we could see each other\u2019s setup: \u2018Here I am sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea\u2019, \u2018Here I am at my table with a glass of wine\u2019\u201d \u2013 cameras were turned off to save on bandwidth and batteries.\nWithout cues from body language, and with only one person able to speak at a time, the discussion required \u201cmore active management\u201d than usual, says West. But \u201cit went really well \u2013 so well that I woke up the next day and thought, \u2018God, I haven\u2019t cleaned up after book club last night.\u2019 It was quite a long time before I went downstairs and realised it had just been me, sat on the sofa. It felt really genuine.\u201d\nWith her energies split between work and her two young children, West says it was a relief to find that her book club would not be disrupted. \u201cI have confidence that, at least once a month, it\u2019s going to feel like I\u2019ve had a night off, being sociable.\u201d\nThe relaxed formality of book clubs might be a boon as we adjust to the age of the \u201cvideo hang\u201d, lending structure to an unfamiliar and often stilted interaction. Virtual pub quizzes are proving similarly popular right now.\n\u2019s book club, based in Beaconsfield, has moved through several platforms in 15 years \u2013 from email to WhatsApp and now, Zoom. All bar two of the eight active members are over 60; Cottman predicts that their first virtual meeting next Tuesday, to discuss \n, will mostly be given over to tech troubleshooting. But as a former teacher turned resilience coach, she says connection, community and \u201cholding on to a bit of normality\u201d will be crucial to weathering the weeks and months to come.\nBooks themselves can help to inspire resilience, says Cottman \u2013 her group\u2019s last pick, \n, an Auschwitz survivor, is a case in point. \u201cIn so many stories of challenge and trauma, there\u2019s hope and positivity and that mindset shift that enables us to keep going,\u201d she says.\nMacfarlane says that he chose The Living Mountain \u2013 a \u201cmasterpiece of close observation\u201d of the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland, and the book he has given as a gift more than any other \u2013 so as to venture beyond our quarantine confines. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t reach distant landscapes at the moment, but we can read and dream our way into them,\u201d he says.\nShepherd wrote the slender volume during the second world war, and her reflections on love, loss and goodness are set against a backdrop of distant disaster. Macfarlane calls it a \u201cbook of beauty born of crisis\u201d, with echoes of the one that we are currently facing; but, as the first choice for #CoReadingVirus, it is \u201cneither a work of escapism nor a work that confronts\u201d coronavirus head-on.\nHis ambitions for his book club are modest, Macfarlane says, but not frivolous. \u201cI don\u2019t see reading as turning away from what\u2019s happening. Dreaming other places into being, other ways of being \u2013 these are powerful needs.\u201d\nIt is noteworthy that as the 2011 medical-thriller \n and the \n, none of the book clubs I spoke to had themed their reading material around the coronavirus. It suggests, that in connecting over literature, we are seeking to align over a common experience \u2013 other than our shared experience of Covid-19.\n\u201cI think escapism is going to be the way forward,\u201d says West, of her book club. Their current pick, a collection of poetry by Fran Lock, predates the pandemic, but its title? \n.\n \nHow about our very own? On the first Tuesday of each month, we put a theme or author to a public vote and settle on a book chosen by you. Prolific reader and publisher Sam Jordison then hosts an online discussion every Tuesday where he explains the book\u2019s history, researches any questions you ask and even sets up live chats with the author \u2013 while you get on with the serious business of talking.\n \nIt\u2019s been on your to-read list for ever and there has never been a better time to tackle War and Peace than with the guidance of novelist \n, who is leading a virtual book club with the hashtag #TolstoyTogether.\n \nAuthor \n kicks off discussion of Nan Shepherd\u2019s The Living Mountain on Twitter at 7pm GMT on 28 March, using the hashtag \n \nThe live event company is starting its new book club with \n, ahead of a live-streamed Q&A with author Emma Jane Unsworth on 19 April. \n \n\u2019s love of reading shone through in \n of her for Vanity Fair.

The result of a 10-year project with biotech firm Virustatic, the snood has now been hurried into production. Its creators say the fabric coating has a similar formation to the carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of the cells that cover the oesophagus. They created the technology by attaching glycoproteins to carbon cloth, then to other cheaper materials such as cotton.\nTheir tests have shown that it traps 96% of airborne viruses. According to inventor Paul Hope, the snood is more breathable and flexible than a conventional mask, meaning patients can also wear them. \u201cThe biggest spreader of viruses, the people you are treating, can\u2019t wear existing masks,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of issues with breathability. If they could, that would reduce the virus within the hospital environment. Our snood mask moulds to your face, and it\u2019s all the way round, not just your nose and mouth. It fits everyone.\u201d The company hopes to make as many as a million a week, reserving a portion for the NHS.\nOur Robocop future just got one alarming step closer thanks to Chinese tech firm \n. The Shenzhen-based company has developed a \n that can detect people with a fever up to five metres away, sounding an alarm when anyone with a high temperature comes close.\nThe headset, which is already used by police in Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai, features an infrared temperature detector, an augmented-reality visor, a camera that can read QR codes, plus wifi, Bluetooth and 5G so it can beam data to the nearest hospital. Equipped with facial recognition technology, the helmet can also display the subject\u2019s name on the AR visor, as well as their medical history.\nAccording to the developer, it would only take officers two minutes to scan a queue of more than 100 people with the help of the helmets, while one big hospital would only need 10 such helmets to cover every corner of its site. Reassuring in a pandemic, perhaps, but a terrifying prospect the rest of the time.\nAn Italian company came to the rescue after a hospital ran out of crucial valves for its ventilators. The hospital in Chiari, in the Brescia area of northern Italy hit hard by the virus, had 250 coronavirus patients in intensive care, and was short of venturi valves \u2013 which connect the ventilator to a patient\u2019s face mask, and need to be replaced for each patient.\nAfter the original supplier was unable to provide new valves quickly enough, the hospital put out a call for help. \n contacted the manufacturer, \n, but was unable to obtain a digital model of the part, so its team decided to reverse-engineer its structure themselves. The first prototype was ready within six hours, with 100 working valves printed and supplied to the hospital within a day.\nIsinnova CEO Cristian Fracassi \n : \u201cThe valve has very thin holes and tubes, smaller than 0.8m \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to print the pieces \u2026 Plus you have to respect not [contaminating] the product \u2013 really it should be produced in a clinical way.\u201d His team has since developed a 3D-printed adapter to turn a \n into a non-invasive ventilator for coronavirus patients, to help to address the possible shortage of oxygen masks.\nSouth Korea has been \n in testing its citizens for Covid-19, with nearly 20,000 people tested every day, more people per capita than anywhere else in the world. As well as pioneering \n centres, where people with symptoms can check their health status, one hospital in Seoul has introduced new \n that allow medical staff to examine patients from behind the safety of a plastic panel.\nThe phone box-like \nuse negative air pressure to prevent harmful particles from escaping outside. Each patient steps into the booth for a rapid consultation via an intercom, while samples can be safely taken by swabbing their nose and throat using arm-length rubber gloves built into the panel. The whole process takes about seven minutes and the booth is then disinfected and ventilated.\n\u201cWe used to collect samples inside a large negative-pressure room,\u201d says Kim Sang-il, president of the H Plus Yang hospital where the booths are in use. \u201cIt took a long time to disinfect the place. We used to take eight to nine samples per day, but we can now take 70 to 80.\u201d\nTired of pulling your sleeve over your hand to touch the door handle? Belgian 3D printing company \n has designed a hands-free door handle attachment. Under the slogan \u201cDo less harm, use your arm!\u201d, the design, which has been made available to download for free, consists of two simple parts that can be screwed either side of a handle, allowing you to use your arm or elbow to turn the handle.\n\u201cDoor handles are said to be among the most contagious places in a building,\u201d says the company\u2019s CEO, Fried Vancraen. \u201cWe call upon everyone who has access to a 3D printer to print the part and make it available to their local community.\u201d\nLooking like a cluster of lightsabers on wheels, a \n has been developed by a Danish company. It can kill virus cells and sanitise hospital wards without the need for chemicals. The eight bulbs on each roaming robot emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light, which destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can\u2019t multiply.\nThis could reduce dependency on chemical-based disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide, which require rooms to be left empty for several hours during sterilisation, making them impractical for many parts of hospitals.\nThe robot was launched in early 2019, following six years of collaboration between parent firm, Blue Ocean Robotics and Odense University Hospital, but recent demand has seen production accelerate, so it now takes less than a day to make one robot.\nA \n has been developed by Chinese firm YouiBot, which took its existing robot base and added thermal camera and UV-C bulbs. It has supplied factories, offices and an airport, and a hospital in Wuhan. \u201cIt\u2019s running right now in the luggage hall,\u201d says YouiBot\u2019s Keyman Guan, \u201cchecking body temperature in the day, and it goes virus killing during the night.\u201d\nChinese company Winsun has deployed its rapid 3D-printing powers on an architectural scale, manufacturing 15 \n in a single day. The little concrete cabins were originally designed to be used as holiday homes, but the company ramped up production to cope with demand from overcrowded Chinese hospitals at the height of the epidemic.\nThe buildings, which have showers and eco-toilets, were printed through an extrusion process, with a robotic arm mounted on rails, gradually depositing layers of concrete to build the walls. The company says it uses recycled construction rubble in the process and claims its structures are twice as strong as a conventional concrete construction.\nCoders have joined the battle against coronavirus, racing to \n. In South Korea, virus-tracking apps make up six of the most popular 15 downloaded apps, by far the most popular being Corona 100m. Using the wealth of data collected by the government\u2019s testing programme, the app alerts users when they come within 100 metres of a location visited by an infected person.\nIt also allows people to see the date a coronavirus patient was confirmed to have the disease, along with that patient\u2019s nationality, gender, age and the places the patient visited. Launched on 11 February, the app had a million downloads in its first 17 days.\nOther initiatives include the \n website, which shows the travel histories of confirmed Covid-19 patients and \n, which functions like a search engine for information on coronavirus-hit areas. Other states, including Singapore and Israel, have also deployed apps that can help the authorities track who users have come into contact with, to help model the spread of the virus, while Taiwan has introduced an \n system that alerts the local police if a quarantined user leaves their home.\nDiscussions are \n about a tracking app in the UK, sparking a debate about privacy. An \n from a group of \u201cresponsible technologists\u201d highlighted concerns \u201cthat data collected to fight coronavirus could be stored indefinitely or for a disproportionate amount of time, or will be used for unrelated purposes\u201d. They added: \u201cThese are testing times, but they do not call for untested new technologies.\u201d\nCzech company Prusa, which claims to have the largest 3D printing farm in the world, with more than 500 printers, has started mass-producing protective \n, used by medics. It is manufacturing over 800 a day, and has donated 10,000 to the Czech ministry of health.\n\u201cThe materials required to manufacture one unit are less than $1 and that is without any quantity discounts when buying,\u201d says the company\u2019s founder, Josef Pr\u016f\u0161a. \u201cWe literally got materials around Prague during one afternoon.\u201d\nAnother firm, Stratasys, has also developed a 3D-printed face shield and masks. According to its CEO, Yoav Zeif: \u201cThe strengths of \n, be anywhere, print virtually anything, adapt on the fly, make it capable for helping address shortages of parts related to shields, masks, and ventilators, among other things.\u201d\nIn a world where we are forbidden from leaving the house, it looks like drones might finally come into their own. In China, the world leader in drone manufacturing, the mini choppers have been \nfor everything from fever detection in crowds to disinfecting public spaces, to delivering supplies to far-flung locations.\nAgricultural drones, designed to spread fertiliser, have been repurposed to spray disinfectant across pavements and public squares, as well as deliver groceries to remote island communities. Drones have also been used to deliver test samples, dramatically cutting journey times.\nIn France, the police have started using drones to help \n its lockdown, monitoring parks and public spaces to make sure people are not leaving their homes for non-essential trips, while, in the UK, \n are planning to increase their fleet of drones, which will be equipped with speakers to transmit public information messages and tell people to get back indoors. No nipping out to get those non-essential items, now \u2013 the drones are watching.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3dedb9bf6435bc7a4a09334848ea41d31cd0caa/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=21482b4a12105414784caf634933722a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/can-the-houseparty-app-help-us-stay-sane-in-quarantine-i-downloaded-it-to-find-out": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/can-the-houseparty-app-help-us-stay-sane-in-quarantine-i-downloaded-it-to-find-out", "title": "Can the Houseparty app help us stay sane in quarantine?

She pointed her chin at the door, her face a mask of distress. I followed her gaze to see a little boy wholeheartedly licking the doorknob. We watched in horrified fascination.\n\u201cThis is what happens,\u201d Aimee sighed, \u201cWhen you spare the rod.\u201d\nThat was our last \u201cin real life\u201d night together. After we elbowed our way out the door and hugged goodbye, the University of Iowa moved classes online and we tucked ourselves, reluctantly, into our respective homes.\n\u201cWho\u2019s up for a virtual happy hour?\u201d Marisa texted the group a few days later.\n\u201cIn!\u201d we said, thoroughly sick of our own company. After a lot of back and forth about platforms, I suggested we download Houseparty.\nHouseparty had gotten a lot of attention among the under-24 set when it first started back in 2016. Its CEO, Sima Sistani, touted it as the \u201cnext best thing to hanging out in real life\u201d. It had been installed by 35 million users (40% of whom were outside the US.) In subsequent years, however, downloads of the app had declined \u2013 that is, until the pandemic. Downloads in March 2020 were the highest of the year. Twitter confirmed Houseparty\u2019s re-emergence into public consciousness: \u201cEveryone is back on Houseparty. It\u2019s 2017 again.\u201d \u201cMake Houseparty great again!\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s down to get Houseparty again and get this social distancing lit?\u201d\nReady to get literally anything lit, I persuaded everyone to download the app and meet up in an hour. I brought out the wine, sent my new username out and waited. Slowly people started popping up on my phone screen. We broke into smiles and all started speaking at once. The audio immediately became a garbled mess.\n\u201cDammit!\u201d I shouted. \u201cY\u2019all broke Houseparty!\u201d\nThe audio did smooth out shortly after, but kept dropping intermittently, probably due to my slow internet. This might have been a blessing, as I believe I missed a whole section about how Ian didn\u2019t use soap in the shower.\n\u201cJust a vigorous blast on the pits\u201d is all I heard.\n\u201cVox said this is gonna last 18 months,\u201d Jeremy said.\n\u201cWhat we are really finding out from this coronavirus is what everyone\u2019s news source is,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cMine is y\u2019all.\u201d\nJeremy tapped a pair of dice on top of the screen, that launched a trivia game. We all tapped fast and furious on answers to questions like: what was the name of Cady\u2019s high school in Mean Girls (Answer: North Shore.) There was a lot of yelling and laughter and then the game ended. I started thinking about dinner.\n\u201cI ordered a pizza last night,\u201d I said. \u201cWe drove to the pizza place but they didn\u2019t let us in. They asked us to roll down the window and threw the pizza at us.\u201d\nWe laughed and for a brief moment it felt like we were all at the Dandy Lion again, joking over cheeseburgers. Shortly after, we signed off. It was dinnertime, tacos had to be made, soylent consumed.\nSeeing my friends via Houseparty didn\u2019t feel normal \u2013 not by a long shot \u2013 but it did seem to lift, somewhat, the isolation I was feeling. That glass (or two) of wine felt much better when it was shared, even if just on a screen. My friends agreed. (Well, all except the one who doesn\u2019t use soap.) The games were too easy, he thought.\n\u201cYou try being a competitive virtual playground in the age of corona,\u201d Jeremy joked.\nGames notwithstanding, faced with an indefinite period of social distancing, I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll all jump back on to Houseparty in a day or so. If nothing else, it\u2019ll give me a reason to brush my hair.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11ef986f64677af03c53af61f8323185e6510fd/253_0_7446_4472/master/7446.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ff01d41f0ff1a81cc6e4cbdcb6b58b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus", "title": "Mobile phone industry explores worldwide tracking of users", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 12:00:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Talks about global data-sharing to counter coronavirus will raise privacy concerns</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The mobile phone industry has explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track individuals<strong> </strong>around the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>The Guardian has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking individuals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The mobile phone industry has explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track individuals\naround the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19.\nThe Guardian has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking individuals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system.\nAny move to create such a global tracking system would represent a major escalation in efforts to use mobile phone location data to help stem the pandemic, and would be likely to raise concerns among privacy and security experts.\nUntil now the use of mobile phone tracking in the fight against Covid-19 has been restricted to national governments, which are either monitoring data within their borders or in discussions with mobile operators and technology companies about doing so.\nThey include the US, India, Iran, Poland, Singapore, Israel and South Korea. The British government is engaged in talks with BT, the owner of the UK mobile operator EE, about \n to determine the efficacy of isolation orders.\nThe concept of an international mobile tracing scheme would go further, enabling authorities to monitor movements and potentially track the spread of the disease across borders. The GSMA represents the interests of 750 mobile phone operators and vendors across the world and helps set international standards for companies.\nA person familiar with its exploratory talks said they were at an early stage and that decisions had not yet been made about whether to move ahead with the plan. The aim of such a global network would be to enact \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, enabling authorities to use mobile location data to track who a person infected with Covid-19 may have come in contact with.\nA spokesperson for GSMA strenuously denied it was currently involved in any project to create a global tracking system. \u201cWe are not involved in a project of this nature,\u201d the GSMA spokesperson said. However the GSMA also said it would not comment on discussions that had taken place or ideas that were being explored.\n\u201cIn this emergency situation, the GSMA and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Mats Granryd, the director of the GSMA, said in a statement emailed to the Guardian. \u201cWe are engaging with operators, policymakers and international organisations around the world to explore viable mobile big data and AI solutions to fight this pandemic while adhering to principles of privacy and ethics.\u201d\nAdvocates of using mobile phone technology in medical emergencies say accurate and up-to-date information can be a vital tool.\nThe \nthat the US government was in active talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans\u2019 phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus.\nThe emergency measures \n go further, enabling authorities to track individual people suspected or confirmed to have been infected to notify individuals who may have come into contact with them. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules.\nThe proposed UK scheme would involve anonymised mobile phone data being used to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working. It could also be used to send health alerts. While the information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns over the scheme, calling for \n in the way the government uses mobile data.\nOne telecommunications expert, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, said GSMA would be capable of creating a global data-sharing network if mobile operators around the world agreed to share usage information. That data would then be used to help authorities visualise the spread of the disease, or to track individual subscribers to perform \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, using an individual\u2019s location to detect how the disease might spread.\nDavid Kaye, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said it was not necessarily a bad thing for governments to use technology as a means to help control the virus. But he said there were important rule of law standards that had to be taken into account if emergency measures were put in place, including the possible tracking of individuals by mobile phone companies.\nHe said these included alerting individuals whose data was being tracked, being fully transparent about the data collection and subjecting any such initiatives to judicial oversight. He also said there should be sunset provisions in place and continuously reviewed so that emergency measures did not become permanent.\n\u201cWhen I think about how these tools can be helpful, making sure they are adhering to basic standards is really important,\u201d Kaye said.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f85302c178811064904f95b10f4b3f9d83e36181/0_51_3350_2011/master/3350.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b9dc77c5360df13748bbbfc9518174f6"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/12/which-streaming-stick-should-i-buy-for-disney": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/12/which-streaming-stick-should-i-buy-for-disney", "title": "Which streaming stick should I buy for Disney+?", "published": "Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:00:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>Adnan has an old smart TV and Now TV box, so needs something new to stream Disney+ </p><p>My smart TV is old (Samsung, 2014) so I watch BBC iPlayer on my Now TV box (also old and discontinued).

Perhaps Sky does not know. However, I\u2019d assume it means some time this year, not next.\nFor those who have not caught up with \n, the service was promised in 2017 and launched in the US late last year. The company knows it is a decade late to the film-streaming market pioneered by Netflix in 2010. It can make up for that by making its service available across a wide range of geographies and technologies.\nDisney+ will be available via web browsers on PCs, on Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, on Amazon Fire TV and Fire tablets, on Roku streamers, on Apple TV, the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One, and via Google Chromecast.\nIt will also cover almost all the big smart TV platforms: Roku TV, Android TV, LG\u2019s WebOS and Samsung\u2019s Tizen. In the UK, BT and Virgin Media still appear to be missing, but pretty much every Ask Jack reader should be able to get Disney+ on a device they already own.\nDisney is also pricing the service to attract annual signups, with a pre-launch offer of \u00a349.99 (\u00a310 off) if you subscribe on or before 23 March. This includes HD and 4K videos, for which other services may charge extra. It will also let you download movies to watch later.\nDisney+ will not initially have the volume of content you can get from \n or Amazon Prime. However, Disney\u2019s string of takeovers of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), Lucasfilm (2012) and 21st Century Fox (2017) means it makes up in box office appeal what it lacks in depth.\nIt\u2019s got Star Wars plus The Mandalorian, the Toy Story series and the rest of Pixar\u2019s back catalogue, the Marvel movies and Disney\u2019s studio productions, including a vast library covering everything from the original 1928 \n (Mickey Mouse\u2019s first short film) to several versions of Beauty and the Beast. It\u2019s also going to spend something like $1bn a year on new productions.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that Disney+ will be available on every major platform in every country, so you should check before you subscribe. Nonetheless, I expect it will appeal to families with children of all ages. In the long term, it should give Netflix some real competition.\nNow TV boxes are based on Roku technology but don\u2019t provide all of Roku\u2019s services. Instead, they are customised for Sky TV viewers, who want to watch Sky Sports, Sky Cinema, and so on. The platform\u2019s attractions are that the boxes are generally quite cheap, and discount coupons let you buy services for a short time rather than paying for annual subscriptions. \n Sports sells expensive passes that last for a day, a week or a month.\nIf you use Sky\u2019s streaming services, \n is a good choice. You can watch BBC iPlayer and other British catch-up services, plus Netflix and other video services, though not Amazon Prime. If you don\u2019t watch Sky, you\u2019d be better off with a Roku streamer or something similar.\nIt really depends on how keen you are to get Disney+, how keen you are to buy a new gadget and which other services you need. For example, someone who mainly watches Amazon Prime may lean towards a Fire TV, while the odd bod who subscribes to \n may prefer an Apple TV box.\nRoku got started when Netflix decided not to make its own streaming device but gave Roku\u2019s founder \u2013 Anthony Wood, a former Netflix vice-president \u2013 a $6m investment to create one. Since then, Roku has positioned itself as an independent supplier in a somewhat balkanised market.\nIt did deals to provide \u201cchannels\u201d (apps) for Amazon videos and, more recently, Apple TV+. It also provides a free software development kit that enables anyone to create a channel in a Visual Basic-style scripting language called BrightScript.\nIn 2014, Roku launched Roku TV, which enabled TV manufacturers to build its system into smart TV sets. These can be updated in much the same way as Roku streaming sticks, and seem to have become popular in the US. Hisense, a Chinese TV manufacturer, launched \n and Europe in November.\nRoku hardware is usually cheap because the company makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from CTV (connected TV advertising), not sales of devices. It should also get a cut when Roku owners use their device to subscribe to paid-for channels. More users means more money.\nSome Roku devices had voice search and control, and last year Roku launched \n. (Note: needs Roku OS 8.1 or later.) I have not tried it, but if you own an Amazon Echo, Dot or Show etc, your Roku should work with it. However, given that voice commands don\u2019t seem to work all that well on Amazon\u2019s Fire TV, don\u2019t set your expectations too high.\nAs mentioned, many people will choose a device because it\u2019s connected to or promoted with a service from Amazon, Apple, Google, Sky or whatever. For those who want Netflix and a decent range of services, Roku provides a good baseline at an affordable price. An \n is a reasonable alternative. Amazon\u2019s \n is a fork of Android and has \n.\nStreaming sticks are tiny computers complete with a processor, memory and an operating system. If you are willing to pay a bit more, you can get one with a faster processor and more memory, which should deliver better performance. Some can also play quite good games. The leading examples include Nvidia\u2019s Shield TV, based on the Android TV platform, and Apple TV.\nThe basic idea of \n \u2013 successor to the failed Google TV \u2013 is to use Android for streaming. It can be supplied in a set-top box or built into a TV set. Of course, Android apps are designed to work with touch on a smartphone, not with a remote control on a big TV screen, so they must be adapted. Check which apps are available in the Google Play Store for Android TV.\nThe saving grace is that all Android TV devices support Google Cast, so you can set up streaming from another device and use your smartphone as the controller. Once installed, streams are downloaded directly, just as with a Roku. They are not sent from the originating smartphone, tablet or PC. Some devices also support Google Assistant, which can be handy.\nAsus developed the first Android TV in 2014, but the platform has been swamped by \n. It\u2019s impossible to say which one might be best. However, you can check for Android 9 (Pie) plus ethernet, HDMI 2 and USB 3 ports, dual-band wifi, 4K video support with H.265 decoding in hardware, more storage, more memory and other familiar computer features. Most of them cost from about \u00a325 to \u00a355 so it\u2019s not a huge risk.\nThe standout Android TV box is the \n, which comes in standard and Pro versions at \u00a3149.99 and \u00a3199 respectively.

Everyone\u2019s doing it, but no one can quite agree on the social norms. Do you need to be close with someone to share an account? Can that person pass the login on? Does it matter how big or profitable the service is? \n When do you add a new partner\u2019s profile?\nJordan told me he still shares his Netflix and Stan accounts with his ex\u2019s mum \u201cbecause, as she puts it, \u2018it\u2019s not my fault you broke up. I should still get to use them.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t argue with that logic,\u201d he says.\nOne woman told me she used her ex\u2019s Foxtel account for 18 months after breaking up, before he stopped paying his bill: \u201cHe was always terrible with money. Ruining my life once again.\u201d Another says she still shares Netflix with her ex-husband: \u201cHe uses it more than he sees his kids, whom we also \u2018share\u2019.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no mystery why this is happening: getting people to pay for online content has never been easy, especially younger generations who have grown up with either unprecedented access to free streaming and/or \n. A \n from media research firm Magid found that 42% of Gen Z and 35% of millennials share passwords for streaming services, compared to 19% of Gen X and 13% of baby boomers.\nOne millennial told me she thinks of it in the same way \u201cas when one person used to buy a magazine and then pass it on to like four other people to read\u201d. But, for Kate, it\u2019s always a considered decision. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as bad about companies like Netflix who pay \n in Australia, but Stan (under Nine) is a bit different as it supports local content \u2026 I [also] don\u2019t share my news subscription logins as journalism needs as much support as it can get.\u201d\nJack shares Netflix, Spotify and Stan accounts with his girlfriend and her family, and Optus Sport with his girlfriend\u2019s football coach. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed at the chopping off of content onto so many platforms, forcing you to get increasingly specific subs,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay for a sub \nfor football.\u201d\nSo, is this actually allowed? And are companies planning to do anything about it? Those are two very different questions.\nStan \n that \u201cyou must keep your account details private and must not share these details\u201d. Under its premium plan, you can watch on four screens at the same time. Netflix \n that accounts \u201cmay not be shared with individuals beyond your household\u201d. It maintains the right to \u201cterminate or restrict your use\u201d if you violate these terms of use. Both companies were approached for comment, but did not respond.\nNetflix, historically, \n policing this rule. The company is large enough that subscription sharing hasn\u2019t stopped their profits soaring, and they\u2019ve even acknowledged its \n to build more subscribers in the long term. But recently, that tune has changed.\nIn \n, the chief product officer, Greg Peters, said Netflix is monitoring the situation and looking for \u201cconsumer-friendly ways to push on the edges of [it]\u201d. This was around the same time that \n announced a crackdown on family plan users, to ensure they shared a home address. It was also a few weeks before the launch of rival streaming giant Disney+.\nWith increased competition, some \n think it\u2019s just a matter of time before investors pressure companies to chase this \u201cmissing revenue\u201d. But there\u2019s no guarantee it would result in more cash.\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t pay for Optus myself, if I got kicked off,\u201d Jack says. \u201cI\u2019d just watch a lot less football highlights.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ae6e9cfc98aa70fc9d40182b901aa8f1d89d23/28_0_1188_713/master/1188.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3873a280190717df064e5bf3c08f5f35"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2020/mar/10/telling-stories-how-linkedin-took-on-office-banter": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2020/mar/10/telling-stories-how-linkedin-took-on-office-banter", "title": "Telling stories: how LinkedIn took on office banter", "published": "Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:44:37 GMT", "summary": "<p>The professional platform is the latest social media site to offer a service where posts expire after 24 hours.

It is fundamentally different from the early social internet, when blogposts, dating profiles and even Facebook statuses were laboured over and crafted to display your originality or ability, to some extent with posterity in mind.\nNow, as LinkedIn\u2019s Davies notes, \u201cthere\u2019s an entire generation growing up with Stories as a way of speaking\u201d, who prefer to \u201cshare content that lives as a moment in time rather than as an item in a feed\u201d.\nThe expiration feature is often presented as a reprieve from the tyranny of \u201cthe grid\u201d; a more casual, off-the-cuff means of engaging with social media, which relieves some of the pressure to present a perfect, cohesive image online.

If you can\u2019t afford a \n (\u00a31,213.71), for example, get as close to the specification as possible.\nIf you are paying for your own kit, you may want to take an economical approach. But if the company is insisting that you work from home, ask for ergonomic equipment. This often costs more, but is worth it in the long run.\nIf your company has an IT department, then it should either supply or advise you on which equipment and software to use. This may well include a \n and a two-factor authentication system, such as \n.\nOne of the IT department\u2019s jobs is to make choices for tens or even tens of thousands of employees. You may not like their choices \u2013 I usually don\u2019t \u2013 but letting everybody pick their own collaborative software, messaging app or video conferencing system doesn\u2019t work. Of course, this doesn\u2019t prevent people from setting up unofficial groups on WhatsApp or Facebook.\nThe good news is that you may end up being more productive when you don\u2019t spend hours commuting or in meetings, taking long lunches or catching up with the latest gossip.\nThe bad news is that you have to set and stick to office routines without the external pressure to turn up on time, take regular meal breaks, and keep to a reasonable sleep schedule. Every company has early birds and night owls, so their work times are likely to diverge. However, you must overlap during some agreed office hours when everyone is always available.\nSelf-discipline is why much of the advice about working from home includes things such as getting dressed for work, even though you might work just as well in your dressing gown. But if you talk to colleagues or customers over video links, you must keep up appearances. You will be judged.\nIf you will only be working at home for a short time, you won\u2019t need much in the way of extra equipment. If you have your own laptop, you will only need an external USB keyboard and mouse, and you may already have those. After that, you can think about a separate monitor, an external hard drive for backup purposes, and either a \n or a \n to connect them all together.\nLaptops have \n so you should not use them for sustained periods of work. You can solve this problem by making your laptop work like a desktop, by putting it on a commercial \n or a pile of books and plugging in an external keyboard and mouse. Your eyebrows should be roughly level with the top of the screen, so you can work without slouching.\nBuy a docking station if you can. If you plug your laptop and all the peripherals into a docking station, you only need to unplug a single cable from the laptop to be able to take it somewhere else. That makes it easy to get a change of scene by working in another room or in the garden.\nOne major problem with working on a laptop is that most domestic tables and many desks are too high. Your arms should be angled slightly downwards when you are typing, not upwards. You can solve this problem by buying an accessory \n, where the keyboard sits under the table top, or an \n, where seat height is the key dimension. However, both of those are getting into home office territory.\nOtherwise, the supreme law for working from home is \n. Make hitting Ctrl-S (for save) a reflex action. Save files to your local hard drive and to an online drive (OneDrive is built into Windows 10), and back them up to an external hard drive or USB thumb drive. Even if you are saving your work on a company server or in an online office suite \u2013 such as Microsoft, Google or Zoho \u2013 you may need a local copy if your comms link goes down.\nMuch the best way to work at home is to set up a proper office in a spare bedroom, junk room, attic, conservatory, garden shed or David Cameron-style \n. If you have a family, your home office should have a door with a \u201ckeep out\u201d or perhaps an \n. So many people are now making podcasts, video conferencing or appearing on live TV from home offices that studio-style \u201con air\u201d signs \u2013 even neon ones \u2013 are becoming a thing. It helps avoid the spouse/partner and/or kids wandering in, to \n.\nHaving dedicated office space means you can have a proper desk, an adjustable office chair, one or more large monitors and a desktop PC that will deliver more power than a laptop for less cost. You might even be tempted to buy a standing desk or a \u201cdesk riser\u201d such as the \n (British) or the \n. \n has these and many other models.\nFor more advice, see my recent answer: \nThat answer didn\u2019t cover video conferencing, which will be important for many people pushed out of their corporate nests. Even if it\u2019s not essential for meetings, it\u2019s useful for quick video chats with colleagues. This fosters camaraderie, especially if you start to feel lonely working on your own. It\u2019s also easy to do, thanks to software such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, TeamViewer and more.\nYou will look and sound a lot better if you buy a decent webcam with 1080p (Full HD) resolution. In previous answers, I\u2019ve recommended the \n webcam with microphone. It\u2019s still a good buy at \u00a363.99, though there\u2019s a newer \n model at \u00a384.99.\nIf you won\u2019t shell out for a webcam, at least get \n. Gamers love them so there are all kinds of models available at reasonable prices. You can also use them to listen to music, thus eliminating background household and traffic noises.\nBroadband shouldn\u2019t be a problem because peak usage is in the evenings when many people are streaming movies or TV or playing games such as Fortnite. Even if everyone starts video chatting, there is easily enough capacity for home workers during the day. However, you should either have an unlimited business broadband service, like me, or a cellular backup based on \n or tethering a smartphone or whatever.\nEither way, your plan B should include an alternative device \u2013 a smartphone or tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, or a spare laptop \u2013 and an alternative way of connecting to the office, even if it means using a hotspot while parked outside a local coffee shop. Sort out all the log-in and connection details and test it before you actually need it. You probably won\u2019t be able to do much work without an internet connection.\nAlmost every operating system supports multiple users, so set up a separate account for work. Make this account look as much like your office PC as possible, with the same wallpaper and the same icons in much the same places. That way, you won\u2019t be distracted by whatever games, social media or entertainment services you use when not working.\nUsing a separate account eliminates all your personal websites from your browsers and browser tabs. Having PornHub loaded is never a good look, even if you don\u2019t accidentally switch to it.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c6f90b019b09143e73ecfdb41a9eea42462b62/0_350_6192_3717/master/6192.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4d796896fcb3f9cdca71c6920c70b5a5"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/27/can-i-move-my-data-to-the-eu-before-google-shifts-it-to-the-us-brexit": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/27/can-i-move-my-data-to-the-eu-before-google-shifts-it-to-the-us-brexit", "title": "Can I move my data to the EU before Google shifts it to the US?", "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:15:18 GMT", "summary": "<p>Post-Brexit, Sean wants to keep his data protected by the EU\u2019s GDPR rather than laxer US privacy laws</p><p>Given Google\u2019s recent announcement about moving UK users\u2019 data to US jurisdiction, what\u2019s the best way to migrate to EU-based services?

We\u2019ve also \n to make Google LLC the data controller responsible for your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.\u201d\nThis makes sense. There is no reason why two countries that are not in the EU should store data in an EU country. It would be much better, of course, if \n stored UK data in the UK. However, now we are just one of dozens of small countries, it may be hard to justify the cost.\nOther online service providers may well make the same decision, after weighing the financial, commercial and legal costs of storing UK users\u2019 data locally.\nAt the moment, it should be a moot point. UK data is covered by the Data Protection Act 2018, which is the UK\u2019s version of the EU\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). One problem is that the UK may \n, along with our food and other standards, as part of a US trade deal. Another problem is that even if we maintain EU-level regulations, there is no guarantee that the US will observe them. Given Trump\u2019s actions since taking the US presidency, it is hard to imagine that the situation has improved since \n shocked us with his revelations.\nIt is hard to be sure where your data is stored because service providers can and do rent space in other people\u2019s hyperscale data centres. However, as far as I know, only Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft have their own server farms in the UK. Google\u2019s are in Dublin, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Facebook\u2019s are in Dublin and Denmark. Microsoft has a site in Dublin, of course, but it also has data centres in London, Durham and Cardiff.\nAs traffic grows, the major online service providers keep opening new data centres to be closer to their customers. However, outside the US and the EU, coverage can be sparse. \n, for example, has only three data centres \u2013 in Chile, Singapore and Taiwan \u2013 south of New Orleans. It doesn\u2019t have any in Africa, or in Brazil, China, India, Russia or Japan.\nAt the moment, Microsoft is the only major service provider to host UK data in the UK. Presumably, this is a commercial decision based on selling Office 365 and Azure cloud services to the British government and businesses that actually care where their data is stored. However, some less popular Office services are served from overseas. Yammer, Planner and Forms, for example, are still served from \n.\nConsumers who use Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com webmail do not have any control over where their data is stored. As a matter of principle, Microsoft stores it for best performance. Local storage is therefore the most likely option but that could depend on network speeds and whether there is enough local storage available.\nAgain, it should be a moot point. Microsoft has been pushing for higher data protection standards in the US, and it responded to the GDPR by \u201clevelling up\u201d. That is to say, it applies \n standards for all users in all countries, even if the local regulations allow lower standards.\nIf you are determined to switch away from Gmail, then Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com is an option. Both services offer 15GB of free storage and both will import your old emails, which makes for an easy transition. (Microsoft also offers an extra 5GB of storage in OneDrive, which Google doesn\u2019t.) Both services let you reply from your \u201cold\u201d email address if necessary.\nHowever, getting everyone to use a new address takes time and I find Outlook.com\u2019s infinite scrolling pages and broken search/move routine a horrible experience in a browser. If you get a significant amount of email, I would only recommend it with a decent mail program such as Microsoft Outlook (the Office program), eM Client, Mailbird or whatever. Fortunately, the smartphone and Windows 10 apps, which provide a different view of your webmail, are fine.\nYou could also consider \n, the English-language version of the German email service, \n (from Global Mail eXchange). It is a free service that can send encrypted emails and it includes three somewhat primitive office apps. GMX used to have a very limited amount of storage but now offers 65GB \u2013 space for \u201cabout half a million emails\u201d, the company says. The idea is to use GMX\u2019s Mail Collector to pick up mail from your other accounts and consolidate it in one place.\nIt is a couple of decades since I last used GMX but it was very easy to open an account and it sent emails without any problems.\nI have mentioned some other alternatives \u2013 FastMail and ProtonMail \u2013 before. \n is a good, independent email service with 24/7 support at reasonable prices: $3 (\u00a32.30) per month with 2GB of storage and $5 per month with 30GB. While the company is Australian, its servers are in Amsterdam and New York, so your data should be inside the EU. Fastmail encrypts the email on its servers and it supports YubiKey access for extra security.\n is an encrypted GDPR-compliant privacy-focused email service based in Switzerland, which has high data protection standards. Its free service only offers 0.5GB of storage, which isn\u2019t viable for many users. Its Plus plan with 5GB of storage costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.18) per month or \u20ac48 per year.\nYou cannot do anything about where \n, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al store your data. These are all proprietary services and they can do whatever they like. If you do not want them to store your data in the US, you will have to download whatever you need (if that\u2019s possible) then delete your accounts.\nThe same thing is true of most business services until they have grown big enough to start opening data centres overseas, such as Adobe.\nHowever, you do have a choice of online storage services or \u201ccloud drives\u201d, where the technologies are basically interchangeable. I covered some of these services in an earlier answer: \nIf you fancy the Swiss option, \n will store 500GB of data for \u00a347.88 per year or 2TB for \u00a395.88 per year. It will also store 2TB for a lifetime for a one-off payment of \u00a3350. The assumption is that disk space will keep getting cheaper until the cost of storing 2TB is irrelevant.\nWhen I got my first 10MB hard drive in the early 1980s, disk space cost about $500,000 per gigabyte, so 2TB would have cost a cool $1bn. Today, you can buy\n. Sobering thought.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7150f799f7f3e453aa469db1dfc95f5efc67b5d5/352_692_4661_2798/master/4661.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a520578af295fc95ac835e7608374b1b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/20/how-do-i-get-my-name-to-the-top-of-googles-search-results": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/20/how-do-i-get-my-name-to-the-top-of-googles-search-results", "title": "How do I get my name to the top of Google\u2019s search results?

It\u2019s still vitally important to all types of business, to consultants and other professionals, bands and musicians, authors and journalists, politicians and many others. For those who can justify the fees, personal branding and \u201creputation management\u201d companies do it for a living.\nAt this point, all the information you need is online somewhere. The problem is that it takes a significant amount of work, which may or may not be worth it.\nIn your case, I imagine that anybody likely to search for the name of a bright, young academic is not going to confuse you with a drug dealer almost twice your age. They already know that two or, usually, many more people have the same name. The people who could have real problems are the ones who share names and professions. Two journalists spring to mind: \n, a novelist and former Guardian crime reporter, and \n, an investigative reporter and television producer formerly on the staff of the New Statesman. Neither is likely to be confused with \n, the artist who won the Turner prize in 2014, or the \n from the BBC\u2019s Antiques Roadshow, or numerous others.\nHowever, the general advice is correct. You need to displace your namesake by producing content that Google\u2019s search algorithms find more compelling than old newspaper crime reports. You could do this by becoming famous, which would generate vast numbers of links to your name. Failing that, you will have to generate as many links as you can through social media, and by writing popular articles, or blogging.\nIt helps to have a distinctive name, so you are off to a good start. People with common names can use various techniques to distinguish themselves. These include varying their first name (Edward, Ed, Eddy, Eddie, Ted, Teddy, Ned, Neddy etc), adding or dropping a middle initial, or expanding and hyphenating their surnames. Some people have become known by their initials, including the American poet EE Cummings and the English author JRR Tolkien. Entertainers can invent stage names, which can be mononymous. Examples include Cher and Sting.\nUnder English law, you can change your surname to whatever you like, and for convenience, affirm it in a \n. This can make sense if your surname is problematic or you are anglicising a name. It would be extreme for your purposes.\nHowever, the key point is to decide on a fixed nomenclature, adopt it, and stick to it. This could include using the Dr to which your PhD entitles you, and abbreviating your first name. You already get the top hit on Google for this search, so tell people to use it.\nYou should also write yourself an identifying statement. The younger Duncan Campbell, for example, uses \u201cinvestigative journalist & computer forensics expert\u201d, and this appears in his \n. Google search can use statements like this to disambiguate people who have the same name.\nAt the moment, your naming and labelling is inconsistent.\nOnce you have decided on a name and a catchy (if possible) description, you should update your website and Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts so that they all send Google the same unique and distinctive message. The more you can incorporate your chosen nomenclature into your academic life, the better.\nAfter that, it is mainly a question of repetition, repetition, repetition.\nGoogle\u2019s results are influenced by domain names so buying appropriate names is a good branding investment. Obviously, .com is the most powerful \n, but most common names were snapped up ages ago. Alternatives include .co.uk, .org, .net, and .info.\nSome \n are popular, and .ac (Ascension Island) could appeal to academics. Radio and TV stations can buy .am (Armenia), .fm (Federated States of Micronesia), and .tv (Tuvalu) addresses. Technology companies have used .ai (Anguilla), .io (British Indian Ocean Territory), .ly (Libya), and .ws (Western Samoa). The .co (Colombia) and .me (Montenegro) domains have broad appeal. Some countries require a local presence, trademark or registered business address, but many people should be able to find a usable domain name somewhere.\nOnce you have a domain, you need to use it, and you have. But one page of static content is not going to hold Google\u2019s interest for long. Ideally, you should have several pages. You could have a landing page that says what you do and why you care about it. You should have an \u201cabout yourname\u201d page that links to your university page and social media accounts, and ideally, these should link back to your website. You could have a publications page that links to your academic papers, with pr\u00e9cis, and so on.\nGoogle\u2019s founding idea was that you could decide a web page\u2019s importance from the number of links to it, and from the quality of the websites doing the linking. A link from the Guardian or the BBC has a lot more \u201cgoogle juice\u201d than a link from, say, Flickr or YouTube, but they all count.\nGoogle Search tries to detect and punish techniques such as \u201ckeyword stuffing\u201d and \u201clink farming\u201d, so you have to avoid anything that looks deceptive while also trying to reinforce your name and declaration. Links should be natural.\nIdeally, you should update your website regularly, at least once a month. Google has a strong bias towards \u201cfreshness\u201d. The more often you update your website, the more often Google\u2019s spiders will index it, and the better you will score.\nProf Brian Cox did not become a household name by publishing academic papers. You do not have to aim for that level of name recognition, but there are lots of things you can do to make your name more widely known. You are, after all, a recognised expert, and your field is more important to more people than particle physics.\nBlogging became a simple and socially acceptable way to build a reputation online after Blogger was launched in 1999, and it became even more important after Google bought the company in 2003. If you cannot blog on your own website, you can blog at yourname.blogspot.com, while linking to your main site and social media accounts.\nYou can also post short stories about your research topics at \n and LinkedIn, and possibly on \n, and promote them on Twitter. Aim at an audience that will never read your academic papers. If you are successful, your thoughts will be picked up by other publications. If you are not, it\u2019s still worth doing. Your real target audience is Google.\nIt will take a few months, but you should be able to build up a coherent online presence that establishes your identity, your authority and your continuing activity. Those are the three things that will increase your reputation with Google\u2019s search algorithms, and improve your visibility. You can\u2019t make your namesake disappear, but you may yet be able to outrank him.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e04a5591a15a9b4158bc446f86edab61d6b43dc/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13e6efd7cbea359a257e760522fafbeb"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/13/how-can-i-speed-up-a-windows-10-laptop": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/13/how-can-i-speed-up-a-windows-10-laptop", "title": "How can I speed up a Windows 10 laptop?", "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>Matt is resurrecting a 10-year-old laptop with only 4GB of memory.

Often, there are alternatives, such as buying second-hand memory modules, and cannibalising laptops sold on eBay for \u201cspares or repair\u201d.\nIn this case, there are very few second-hand modules for sale. When DDR2 was standard, many laptops had 2GB, but very few had the 8GB that would need two 4GB modules.\nIf your laptop can use \n, then you might be able to buy some of that. ECC memory modules have an extra chip for parity checking, and were used in servers. Even decades ago, servers had lots of memory, so 4GB ECC chips should be easier to find.\nOn the bright side, 4GB laptops have been common for most of the past decade, and some people still buy them. It\u2019s better to have 8GB, but 4GB is usable.\n has spent more than a decade making Windows more memory efficient. A laptop that could run Vista well in January 2007 can probably run Windows 10 well today.\nOf course, Microsoft had ulterior motives. One was to enable PC manufacturers to make cheaper laptops. Another was to enable Windows to run on smartphones and tablets that only had 1GB or 2GB. Probably neither of those is still important thanks to tumbling memory prices and the failure of \n smartphones.\nA couple of years ago, Microsoft experimented with a version of Windows 10 called \n, but it didn\u2019t use less memory. Its main purpose was to fit on tablets and cheap laptops with only 16GB or 32GB of storage. Thankfully, that idea seems to have been abandoned. Nobody should be buying laptops with less than 128GB of SSD, or a bigger hard drive.\nThe simplest speed-up routine is to tell Windows to optimise itself for performance. To do this, type \u201cadjust\u201d in the Start menu\u2019s search box and click \u201cAdjust the appearance and performance of Windows\u201d. This will bring up the Performance Options properties sheet from the Control Panel. Select \u201cAdjust for best performance\u201d and Windows will drop all the fancy graphical effects such as sliding things in and out of view. You can use the Custom settings to retain any features you want to keep, such as \u201cShow window contents while dragging\u201d.\nNext, run the Control Panel, type \u201cpower\u201d into the search box in the top right and select \u201cChoose a power plan\u201d. Most laptops are set to \u201cBalanced\u201d. \u201cPower saver\u201d will reduce performance to extend battery life. \u201cHigh performance\u201d will deliver the best performance but use more energy.\nWhen we were using Windows XP and Vista, geeks could improve on Windows\u2019 use of memory. Those days have more or less gone. Windows 10 makes such good use of memory, its swapfile (pagefile.sys, hidden on your hard drive) and other resources that it is best left to do its thing.\nIn my experience, Windows 10 can use anything from 1.2GB to about 3.5GB or more, depending on how much memory you have. If you have more, it will use more. What happens when it runs out of space? It saves the pages of code it\u2019s not using to the swapfile and reloads them into RAM only when they are needed. That\u2019s one reason why fitting an SSD makes a laptop feel much more responsive: swapfile pages reload much faster.\nIn reality, Windows 10\u2019s memory management is more complicated than that. It distinguishes between many types of memory, depending on whether pages are in use, can be swapped out when necessary, can be overwritten because they are no longer needed, or free. Type resmon into Windows 10\u2019s search box, run the Resource Monitor app, and click the Memory tab for a coloured representation of the RAM used for different purposes, including \u201chardware reserved\u201d.\nSophisticated memory management techniques \u2013 including compression \u2013 make it hard to know how much memory any particular program is using. Should you include pages that are in RAM but not in use, that are in the swapfile, or use shared resources? Windows provides a lot of common code through \n library files, and if six programs are using the same megabytes of shared code, it\u2019s counted six times instead of once.\nThe Task Manager provides a crude but useful guide. To run it, press Ctrl-Alt-Del or right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager. Click on Name to sort apps to the top. The Memory column shows how much each program is using. To make the column easier to understand, right-click in the header area, choose \u201cResource values\u201d from the drop-down menu, then Menu and then Percents. On my PC, two browsers, Opera and Vivaldi, are now using more than 20% each, and nothing else matters. The next highest score is \n, with 2.6%. Word 2010, with six documents open, is consuming 0.6%, and a small Excel spreadsheet 0.4%.\nMicrosoft\u2019s \n provides more details. Double-clicking a program\u2019s name tells you how it\u2019s using memory, how much code is shared, and how much virtual memory (ie swapfile space) it\u2019s using. The Working Set Private number, which excludes shared code and swapfile space, tells you how much real RAM a program is using at the time. Obviously, it can vary. As a general indicator, the Peak Working Set number is probably as good as any.\nOnce your laptop is up and running, a quick check with either utility will tell you if any programs are using more memory than they are worth.\nThe Task Manager has Start-up and Services tabs that tell Windows what to load when it boots. Both are more or less obsolete. It is worth checking for start-up programs and disabling ones you don\u2019t want, but do that from the Apps section of the Settings (cogwheel) app.\nWhen we were using clunky old XP and Vista, disabling services could make a big difference, and some of us swore by Black Viper\u2019s guides. Today, I wouldn\u2019t make the effort, and Black Viper stopped providing service configurations with the \n.\nIf a process or service \u201cgoes rogue\u201d \u2013 which can include a single browser tab \u2013 it\u2019s easier to find it in Process Explorer, right-click it, then suspend, restart or kill it. Task Manager also lets you suspend and kill tasks, which can be handy if malware grabs your browser.\nEvery Windows browser will run in 4GB, but the \u201clightest\u201d common browser is Microsoft Edge. This is partly because it\u2019s low on features and extensions, and partly because it\u2019s a modern Windows Store app. Store apps can be suspended in the background, though this is hidden away in the Privacy section of the Settings app, under \u201cBackground apps\u201d.\nBut Microsoft is now switching to a heavier version of Edge based on open source Chromium code, just like Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave and many others, except Firefox.\nThere\u2019s not much to choose between the Chromium-based browsers: they all consume massive amounts of memory and resources. Opera has generally been the lightest, but \u201cEdgium\u201d could change that. I\u2019ve been using the beta test version and it works well. Also, the code has been \n, which is a plus point for people avoiding Google\u2019s \u201c\n\u201d.\nOtherwise, the keys to managing browser memory are not to install many extensions and not to open too many tabs. If you can\u2019t help having hundreds, use a \u201clazy loading\u201d browser. With lazy loading turned on, the browser will only reload or refresh current tabs when you click on them. I once had more than 600 tabs in Firefox and about 300 in Vivaldi, and both still worked perfectly. Alternatively install a tab suspender such as the \n, which unloads dormant tabs but saves the URL so you can go straight back to it if you want. If the browser does slow down, just close and re-open it to free up some memory.\nThe old advice about turning it off and on again has been replaced by \u201crestart your browser\u201d.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa7f160c7a26ddcf9a433ae15d9f25a091e18ae6/0_0_5388_3233/master/5388.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7787d689714e112f2f321306feacf7d5"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/06/how-can-i-copy-1400-dvds-to-a-new-hard-drive": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/06/how-can-i-copy-1400-dvds-to-a-new-hard-drive", "title": "How can I copy 1,400 DVDs to a new hard drive?", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:33 GMT", "summary": "<p>Harry has data backed up to DVDs, but wants to copy the files to a hard drive.

Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.\nThe CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PC/XT\u2019s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn\u2019t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for \u00a362.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.\nIn theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today\u2019s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.\n says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn\u2019t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it\u2019s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there\u2019s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.\nOver the years, many commercial systems have sported multiple DVD drives, sometimes with \n or \n to feed in the discs. But most were aimed at large corporations or service providers, and \n at home users.\nMulti-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to \n. Products aimed at the second were \n, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create \u201ccold storage\u201d backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute \n.\nMF Digital\u2019s \n CD/DVD/BD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed \u2013 perhaps still need \u2013 to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.\nI\u2019m not sure if MF Digital\u2019s cheaper \n would do the job because you don\u2019t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect \u00a31,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.\nThat leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn\u2019t manage to find one \u2013 the search terms are tricky \u2013 and the price might still be prohibitive. I\u2019d guess it would cost from 25p to \u00a31 per disk, and 50p doesn\u2019t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost \u00a3500. You\u2019d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.\nIf anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.\nIf there\u2019s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it\u2019s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don\u2019t set a target, you might never finish the job.\nPerhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.\nAlternatively, you could buy one or two \n and plug them into USB ports, or into a powered USB hub. (Not every USB port provides enough power to run a DVD that doesn\u2019t have its own power supply.) With two drives, you can load a DVD in one drive while the other drive is copying files.\nAfter that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.\n has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for \u201cCopy a lot of CD/DVDs automatically\u201d and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It\u2019s a small (219K), free program and doesn\u2019t need to be installed, so it\u2019s worth a try.\nI also tried Averk\u2019s free \n, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you \u2013 he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive \u2013 and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation\u2019s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.\nThe first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don\u2019t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.\nOver the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it\u2019s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I\u2019m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.\nI\u2019m converting some videos that were in less popular formats \u2013 such as wmv, mov, flv and rm \u2013 to mp4 with the H.264 codec, which is supported by processors (Intel \n) and most graphics cards. Programs such as \n make this very easy to do. You can also reprocess old videos to remove colour casts, make them look sharper, correct faulty aspect ratios and \u201cupscale\u201d their resolution, though the results from my old VHS-C video camera will never look good by today\u2019s standards.\nEven DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids\u2019 birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on \n, Amazon Prime, \n, YouTube or some other streaming service.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe5a7903e2a8b2157e8e1655884f0cff67176b9/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c495abafa7ccf00003cb719c7633ea"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast", "title": "The rise of facial recognition technology \u2013 podcast", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 03:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the Metropolitan police in London.

What I know for certain is that my boys will have one thing on their mind: video games.\nWhat they\u2019re picturing (and I can almost see the thought bubbles above their heads when we talk to them about the school closure) is three months in front of the TV playing Apex Legends. You may be in a similar situation in your household, and you may already be feeling guilty about the amount of time your children will end up spending in front of screens simply because you have work to do and their options are limited.\nAnd while it\u2019s going to be important to manage screen time, to work out some form of educational routine and to get the children outside once in a while, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty if they\u2019re spending more time than usual playing games. There already seems to be a clamour on social media to outdo one another in self-isolation planning. Frankly, if your kids aren\u2019t making artisan soda bread every morning, followed by YouTube pilates, then two hours of conversational French over Skype to a family in Bordeaux than you\u2019re not cutting it.\nBut you \n cutting it. You still have a job, you still have to provide for your family, and if that means more time for the kids on games, that is okay. It\u2019s okay.\nAs I have spent my career trying to get across, video games aren\u2019t that bad. They\u2019re not all violent. They\u2019re not all anarchic and noisy. Some are highly creative, they teach a variety of skills, and they\u2019re social. Playing Fortnite or Overwatch or Minecraft is a vital element in a lot of friendships. When my sons play online with their friends, they chat about their lives and have a laugh: at this time, when they\u2019re unable to meet up, playing games together is going to be a vital way to stay in touch.\nIt\u2019s also normal. If parents find the current situation scary and bewildering, what must our children think? In this environment of constant rapid change, games offer something familiar and steady \u2013 they offer rules of engagement and involvement that never change. As the parent of an autistic child I have long understood this under-appreciated element of video games \u2013 they are machines of routine; you get out exactly what you put in. How comforting, how reliable.\nSure, do what you can in your community to get children together virtually, through apps such as Skype, Google Hangout and Zoom; do what you can to keep them learning. But don\u2019t fret about games, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. If nothing else, games can be added into a home education plan: the \n site has a wealth of exercises based around a variety of subjects, while Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey has a tour mode that teaches participants about the Peloponnesian War. Your children can learn about architecture and urban planning from City Skylines or about agriculture from Farming Simulator.\nBut really, the value of video games is normality. It\u2019s hanging out with friends and making jokes at each other\u2019s expense. It\u2019s not thinking, for a few moments, about what all this means and where it\u2019s going. You don\u2019t have to indulge in self-isolation oneupmanship, and you don\u2019t have to feel bad for falling short on the ideal that\u2019s forming on Facebook and Twitter. You can just get through it. That\u2019s enough. And if games are a part of that, fine. They certainly will be in our household.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4cc848fe017dbed504d2b5fcb46b016601e6e8/0_184_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a12ec58bf0119cd2613658910944d2a4"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/20/animal-crossing-new-horizons-video-games-nintendo": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/20/animal-crossing-new-horizons-video-games-nintendo", "title": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons \u2013 the video game where we can still be together", "published": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 08:32:03 GMT", "summary": "<p>A new instalment in Nintendo\u2019s social simulation series is out now \u2013 and it offers the sort of optimism we\u2019re very short of</p><p>I am scrolling idly through TikTok when I see her, drag queen Bijou Bentley <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bijoubentley/video/6797560219850263814\">performing her routine</a> to a remix of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj\">Nicki Minaj</a>\u2019s Anaconda.

I am thinking to myself, \u201cYes, Isabelle - work.\u201d\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons marks the fifth game in the franchise, that began in 2001 on the \n 64. In the games, you move into a village populated by a random selection of anthropomorphic animals. You are placed in a small home, and then you just live. You explore, you fish, you grow plants, you chat \u2013 there\u2019s no endgame, no goal. You saunter along at your own pace. There\u2019s no rush.\nThere is also no conflict or tension \u2013 the game gives you a sandbox environment in which to pursue a gentler life. The environment shifts with the console\u2019s internal clock \u2013 in winter, plants shrivel and insects disappear, only to stir alive in green pixels again come spring.\nCentral to much of your daily activity is one character: Tom Nook, an enterprising businessman who not only runs the village shop, but also, the local estate agents. You pay your mortgage to him in cash, in whatever instalments you please. Tom is a cute, wide-eyed raccoon, a disarming form that belies the fact that he is functionally \n of Animal Crossing.\nI\u2019m aware that these gameplay mechanics sound somewhere between eye-wateringly mundane and vaguely threatening. In reality, Animal Crossing is neither. It is charming beyond belief.\nMy first step into this softer life came when I was commuting more than two hours a day to college. My Nintendo DS was a comforting escape from the juddering trains and slow buses, and the tender world of Animal Crossing was the opposite of the heightened drama of being a teenager. Breakups, betrayals, hangovers, balancing classes with jobs, working out who I wanted to be, none of that was in question here. Life in Animal Crossing was distilled into basic tasks, basic pleasures and basic connections.\nRelationships with my neighbours in the game were easy in that they were transactional. Friendship, if you could call it that, progresses around the exchange of gifts. When prompted, you can enter nicknames for your pals that the algorithmically generated dialogue will then integrate in to conversation. It is predictable, but for me it gradually escalated in a way that felt comforting. I fished and gathered fruit which I sold to Tom, for the game\u2019s currency \u2013 bells. I listened to the chippy, tuneless music and was soothed. And because there is no ending to Animal Crossing, no plot, I was never in any danger of heightened emotions of any kind. There was no chaos.\nYears later, my husband and I cohabited in a town in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where I inherited the role of mayor from an elderly tortoise. On reflection, and I say this with my hands up, I was a bad civil servant. I always assumed my assistant Isabelle was, well, working. I was less occupied with town planning than digging up artefacts. Though if I were to sell them to Tom for bells, I would have made quicker work of paying off my mortgage. Instead, I dutifully donated them to the initially barren museum, operated by a solitary owl. He was a reliably friendly face, and always seemed so grateful for my contributions to the local cultural resources.\nThis museum-filling lit up the synapses in my brain that respond to collecting: the same ones that are ripped apart by Pok\u00e9mon. Here, we have that same catch \u2019em all mechanic, albeit without any victory at the end. Or any end at all. Our prize is not legacy, heroism or a trophy, but a place in a small, fictional community \u2013 a sense of a job well done. I\u2019m part of a generation that is feeling our way in the dark: employment models have changed, security is gone, continuous email access and a growing gig economy have shifted the boundaries between work and home. It is so easy to feel as though there will always be something else to do and that every completed task simply makes way for another task. To build something that feels tangible and joyful is an antidote to this, even if it is a pixellated town, your contribution amounts to something: happier neighbours, a full museum, a house with many rooms.\nWhen I spoke to other fans of the series, they had similar tales. \u201cThe thing that I really love about the series is the pace,\u201d says Ian Cummins, 32, who works at Facebook and is the only person I have ever met with a full Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cPicking it up after a long day of working, commuting and reading the news relaxes me. It\u2019s meditative for me to pick my fruit, check in with my neighbours and do some fishing before bed. It also lets me live out my fantasy of abandoning the city to live on an island, while fully acknowledging that I would definitely not flourish if I did that in real life.\u201d\nThere is so much to this fantasy \u2013 tasks are manageable, relationships steady, risk nonexistent. Tom Nook isn\u2019t going to send his boys to break your kneecaps if you\u2019re late with a payment. This is a place where progress and value isn\u2019t contingent on ambition. Our fellow villagers are sweet and quirky \u2013 there are gorillas, cats, hedgehogs, horses, there is a musical dog called KK Slider who plays guitar, there is even a bright red duck called Ketchup. Sure, they can occasionally be oppositional, but you can usually bring them around with the gift of fruit, or by delivering letters to their homes.\n\u201cI think the Animal Crossing community served me the way that Twitter serves me now,\u201d says Dearbh\u00e1il Clarke, 22, taking their final year in animation at IADT. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket friendship, without any of the weirdness or commitment of real life. You just put in gifts and get out affirmation ... even when you run out of new dialogue prompts, the friendships don\u2019t feel hollow. They just take on the same rhythm of an old friend telling you the same banal story and you\u2019ll listen and smile because it\u2019s nice to hear and be heard.\u201d\nClarke nails the essence of Animal Crossing: cosiness, predictability \u2013 the feeling of a home and community gradually rising to meet you. I distinctly remember dropping by the Able Sisters clothing shop every day in New Leaf: not necessarily to spend my hard-earned bells on clothing, but rather to say hello to the quiet hedgehog named Sable, sitting in the back behind a sewing machine. Initially, when I approach her she doesn\u2019t even greet me. But day after day, she grows to recognise me. Eventually she begins to offer information about herself. Technically, the prize for winning her friendship by talking to her for 10 days in a row is a QR feature that expands clothing options, but I know that what I am really gaining are the tiny secrets of her life. There is texture in this fiction. The progress from silence to warmth. The real reward for this mini-game, completed purely by interaction and persistence, is knowing Sable, without any risk of being truly known yourself.\nAnimal Crossing offers the one thing in this strange landscape of 2020 that it feels a generation is sorely lacking: a sense of safety. As New Horizons is released, communities worldwide have begun social distancing or self-isolating due to the spread of Covid-19. But with this game fortuitously timed, these new islands will give us a place to escape to from the endless scroll of frightening news, when all we can do is stay indoors and hope for the best.\nThese safe, fictional landscapes are a balm. There is no danger lurking beyond the trees, no urgency in your loan repayments, no betrayal from selfish neighbours. When I saw Bijou Bentley performing, it made me realise that Animal Crossing has a life beyond the beyond the DS or Switch. The quiet lives we have had inside this world have connected with our reality. The quiet lives we have had inside those screens have connected with our reality: scenes from these places become more than memes, they become modes of expression.\nConfined to our homes in real-life, we will compare the different fruits that grow on our trees (some will have pears, others peaches), we\u2019ll compare our neighbours, visit each other\u2019s islands. We will be together safe in the knowledge that every Saturday night when the internal console calendar hits the right time, a white dog named KK Slider will take his guitar and play a gig in all of our virtual towns. We will be united on the dancefloor as he sings in that strange, familiar digital voice. If I could, I would throw bells at his feet like rain.\n Sarah Maria Griffin is an author from Dublin, Ireland. Her most recent novel is Other Words For Smoke.

System memory will be 16GB. The machine will support advanced visual effects such as real-time ray tracing and will have a solid state drive (SSD).\nThe major news from the Cerny briefing concerned the console\u2019s use of variable frequencies in its CPU and GPU, depending on workload. Usually the heat-generating components of a console or computer are locked at a maximum frequency to ensure the system doesn\u2019t overheat, but the PS5 will allow the GPU and CPU to vary frequency of operation, employing \n technology to lend power to each other when games need it. The Xbox Series X graphics core is locked to 1.825GHz, but the PS5 will be able to reach 2.23GHz, suggesting the possibility of a boost in graphics capabilities in Sony\u2019s machine.\nLike Xbox Series X, the \n 5 will also feature a build in SSD rather than a hard disk drive. This will mean much faster boot and loading times for games, as well as a reduction of loading times within game environments. While the Xbox Series X will include a larger capacity drive at 1tb, the PS5\u2019s 825GB model is promising faster throughput, with 5.5GB/s as opposed to 2.4GB/s on Microsoft\u2019s machine. PS5 will also offer an expansion slot so that users are able to plug in a secondary SSD.\nCerny also reiterated Sony\u2019s support for advanced 3D sound, and revealed PlayStation 5\u2019s Tempest 3D Audio engine, which he claimed should be able to support hundreds of in-game sound sources to boost the player\u2019s sense of presence and locality. An example he gave was that, if a player is caught in the rain, the engine would recreate the sounds of individual raindrops landing around the player, rather than simply playing a stock rain sound effect. The 3D sound system will be implemented for headphones at first, but Sony is working on supporting surround sound and virtual surround sound systems.\nAlthough both PS5 and Xbox Series X have similar innards, with both opting for AMD Zen 2 CPUs and AMD RDNA 2 graphics processors, there are significant differences in approach to architecture and system operations. From this early stage, it looks like Microsoft is going for raw but regulated power with the next Xbox, its GPU offering 12.16Tflops via 52 computer units, compared to PS5\u2019s 36 compute units, at 10.28Tflops. Microsoft also revealed its \n Velocity Architecture for streaming game assets from the SSD to the screen, which promises to make 100GB of game content instantly available at any time to the developer, for richer, more detailed worlds. However, Sony\u2019s variable frequency approach to managing power between the CPU and GPU may reap performance rewards \u2013 as long as developers utilise it in the way Sony plans.\nOne area Xbox Series X definitely seems to be ahead is in backwards compatibility. Microsoft has confirmed the machine will be able to play games from each previous generation of the machine, while Sony is only currently talking about backwards compatibility with PS4 titles, and even then, only a selection of them. It claims to have tested compatibility with the Top 100 PS4 games, getting most to work on the new system, but there was a lack of clarity on whether or not PS3 or earlier games would be made available and whether there would be any boost to visuals or performance. Microsoft, on the other hand, has \n that certain Xbox One games will benefit from new visual features when running on Xbox Series X, including high dynamic range (HDR) lighting effects.\nThe one major omission was any word on what the PlayStation 5 will actually look like. While the form factor of the Xbox Series X has been revealed, Sony is yet to show even a mock-up of the PS5. This is likely to come with another online event later in the year.\n x86-64-AMD Ryzen Zen 2, eight cores, variable frequency, up to 3.5 GHz\n AMD Radeon RDNA 2-based graphics engine, variable frequency, up to 2.23 GHz (10.3 Tflops)\n GDDR6 16GB\n 825GB, 5.5GB/s read bandwidth (uncompressed)\n Ultra HD Blu-ray, up to 100GB/disc\n Support of 4K 120Hz TVs, 8K TVs, VRR (specified by HDMI ver 2.1)\n Tempest 3D AudioTech\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/17/25-best-online-video-games-coronavirus-self-isolating": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/17/25-best-online-video-games-coronavirus-self-isolating", "title": "25 best video games to help you socialise while self-isolating", "published": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 07:00:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>If the coronavirus means you\u2019re facing weeks stuck at home, blasting aliens or exploring oceans together online is a great way to stay in touch with friends</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-culture-arts-films-gigs-festivals-cancellations\">Coronavirus and culture \u2013 a list of major cancellations</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-cdc-events-europe-lockdown-uk-deaths-australia-france-italy-spain-update-latest-news\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a><br></li></ul><p>In this time of quarantine and isolation, we all need to keep up both our social interactions and our spirits.

Playing video games with friends online is the perfect solution. You don\u2019t have to be good at them, that\u2019s not the point \u2013 online games provide a location to meet up, chat and have experiences together that may or may not involve blowing stuff up.\nHere is a range of titles that can be learned and enjoyed by both complete beginners and veteran gamers. Whether you have an old laptop or the latest smartphone, there\u2019s something here you can play with pals even if they\u2019re far away.\nThe Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are excellent machines for playing with and against remote friends. They\u2019re easy to set up online (you\u2019ll need to pay a fee of around \u00a345 a year for access) and they both have very intuitive \u201cParty Chat\u201d functions which let you talk to your friends via \n while playing \u2013 in fact you can chat between games too, or even while watching Netflix on your console. Things are a bit more complicated on Nintendo Switch which requires you to download a mobile phone app in order to chat with friends, but even then only a minority of games support the feature. So all our recommendations are primarily based on Xbox and PlayStation.\n(PC, PS4, Xbox One, \n, smartphone)\nThe most popular video game in the world allows groups of eight players to meet online, explore vast blocky worlds and construct amazing buildings together. Think of it as a cross between a Lego set and a fantasy adventure. You and your friends could collaborate on a project \u2013 such as building a scale model of the Taj Mahal \u2013 or play one of the competitive mini-games. It\u2019ll keep you occupied for months.\n(PC, PS4, \n, Nintendo Switch, smartphone)\nStill a favourite with teens everywhere, Fortnite: Battle Royale thrusts 100 players on to an island and then lets them fight it out to see who survives to the end. You can play alone, but the squad mode lets you take part in teams of four and it\u2019s usually joyous and anarchic. Don\u2019t feel it\u2019s just about fighting either. If you land your team somewhere quiet, you can mess about together for ages, building forts and sailing boats. There\u2019s also an ingenious creative mode where you can build your own levels.\n(PC, Xbox One)\nThis seafaring adventure from veteran developer Rare allows up to four friends to clamber aboard a pirate galleon then set sail looking for treasure and adventure. You\u2019ll encounter other players as well as skeleton ships, islands and quests, and the whole thing is designed to get friends working together. It\u2019s utterly enchanting and often hilarious.\n(Nintendo Switch, \n, PS4, Xbox One)\nStar in your own slasher movie with up to seven friends, as teens desperately try to escape the murderous clutches of Jason Voorhees. One player is randomly selected for each round to play the killer, then everyone else has to work together to escape the camp. There are numerous weapons and items to discover and side missions to fulfil, and it all adds up to a tense, exciting experience. Dead By Daylight offers a similar experience with a wider range of monstrous homicidal enemies.\n(PC, PS4, Xbox One)\nHave you ever thought about what would happen if you and your friends tried to rob a bank? Or a casino? This is probably the safest way to find out. GTA Online is available when you buy Grand Theft Auto V and it allows groups of four friends to plan and execute multi-stage heist missions together, all taking on different roles \u2013 just like an interactive crime movie. At least one of you will need to have played the game before and reached the appropriate skill level, but playing with a mostly amateur and unfamiliar crew offers hours of knockabout slapstick fun. For a more sedate experience, Read Dead Online does similar things, but with more horses and moseying. \n(PC, PS4, Xbox One)\nOkay, the title is pretty grim, but this four-player cooperative survival game is strangely endearing. The idea is to survive in a hostile world as long as possible, gathering natural resources in order to make fires, cook food and craft weapons to fight off the extremely unfriendly indigenous wildlife. A pretty effective way of discovering which of your friends you can rely on in a life-or-death situation.\nThe paradox of \u201cmobile gaming\u201d is that much of it happens when people aren\u2019t mobile at all: they\u2019re sitting on the sofa, lying in bed or (caveat: not recommended) perched on the loo. Most of these games will run happily on a recent (say, from the last three or four years) iPhone or Android smartphone, although a couple of them \u2013 Sociable Soccer and Butter Royale \u2013 are iOS-only and part of Apple\u2019s \u00a34.99-a-month Apple Arcade subscription.\n(\n/\n)\nArmchair golfers who like to play with friends are well-served on mobile: see also Super Stickman Golf 3 and Golf Battle. What I like about Golf Clash is partly the rapid-fire matches: if you come up against someone much better than you, the pain is over fairly quickly. But I also like the sense it gives you of a big community of players out there, including your Facebook friends.\n(\n/\n)\nOne of the oldest mobile games still being actively supported \u2013 it was first released in 2009 \u2013 Words With Friends could be a marvellous tonic for anyone in self-isolation. You can have a bunch of its turn-based Scrabble-like matches going on at once, including in-game chat \u2013 and if your real-life friends aren\u2019t playing, it\u2019ll match you up with strangers.\n(\n/\n)\nThis may be a controversial pick: I was as unsure as many people about Mario Kart Tour when it first came out for smartphones in September 2019. Its freemium model wasn\u2019t super-aggressive by mobile standards, but it still stuck in the craw for Mario Kart. What\u2019s changed my mind, though, is the recent addition of a proper multiplayer mode, including friend-matchmaking. It\u2019s still second-best to playing online on a Switch or even a 3DS, but if you don\u2019t have those available, this may grow on you as it has done on me.\n(\n/\n)\nNow four years old, this is one of the games I\u2019ve tended to play heavily for a while, then drop out of for a year before firing it up again, and spending a week getting royally duffed up while I get to grips with all the new features. I\u2019m firing it up again now, though, because Clash Royale\u2019s blend of card-collecting/deck-building and strategic battles remains magic. But also because its clans system, where you can band together with friends for friendly matches and card-swapping, is one of the better mobile-game recreations of real-world networks.\n(\n/\n)\nWait a second! A game that involves walking lots outside, at a time when we may soon be encouraged to stay inside? Stay with me. Developer Niantic is making some changes designed to make the game fun to play \n. More beasties will be spawning around you, and incense packs (which attract more of them) will be super-discounted, and will last for an hour. Meanwhile, another recent improvement is the \u201cgo battle league\u201d which gets you battling your Pok\u00e9mon against those of other players around the world. If doing it from your living room and garden is easier, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see a big spike in players again.\n(\n)\nYou can guess a football-loving gamer\u2019s age by whether they go misty-eyed at the mention of Sensible Soccer. Some of the team behind that series are back together for Sociable Soccer, an Apple Arcade exclusive. It\u2019s more than just an homage to Sensi\u2019s wonderful pinball-esque gameplay either: there\u2019s an inventive card-based team-building system and a meaty 60-hour campaign mode to keep anyone busy. Plus there\u2019s a new online multiplayer option, which right now is teaching me just how far my standards have slipped since my glory days of Sensible Soccer.\n(\n/\n)\nSomething I gravitated towards for this particular roundup was mobile games that do more than simply let you play against other people online. The latest in Gameloft\u2019s Asphalt racing series is a good example: it has a \u201cclub\u201d feature where you can create your own driving club, add friends, and then challenge one another and run a proper league table. Even if you\u2019re playing alone, there\u2019s a decent career mode and regular new daily \u201cevents\u201d to keep your interest up in this fun arcade racer.\n(\n)\nAnother Apple Arcade exclusive, this is essentially a top-down Fortnite with a dairy obsession. You run around grabbing food-themed weapons and splatting other players in 32-person battle royales, or teaming up with friends in squads of four. The pitch for a \u201cchild-friendly Fortnite\u201d will elicit a massive eyeroll from most children (mine, certainly) but Butter Royale is great as a casual alternative \u2013 especially if you have an Apple TV and a compatible joypad handy.\n(\n/\n)\nThis isn\u2019t a traditional game: it\u2019s a website (and apps) for playing, creating and sharing multiple-choice trivia quizzes about\u2026 well, about pretty much any topic you can think of. Designed to be used by schools as well as by parents and children at home, there are subscription options but you can do a lot with it for free. In my house we\u2019ve been casting a quizmaster\u2019s phone to the TV screen and getting everyone to play on their phones, which works really well. Plus \u2013 not to tempt fate \u2013 it could be a genuinely useful tool for parents if and when schools in the UK close, and we\u2019re all scrabbling around for good home-learning tools.\nIf you don\u2019t usually play many computer games, an easy way to get started is to download the hugely popular platform \n, but you can also buy and download games straight to your computer from online stores such as \n (which has a great collection of classics as well as more modern games) and \n (which specialises in games from independent creators). You can also use the free voice chat app \n to talk to each other as you play and its screen share feature allows you to show each other your screens. Me and my friend, who is stuck out in California, have been using this feature to show each other the houses we\u2019ve been building in The Sims 4.\nWindows/Mac (\n/\n)\nIf you need a good laugh, this is guaranteed to deliver. You and up to three others team up to prepare meals for hungry customers: chopping, cooking, assembling, delivering, and washing up. Sounds easy, but each kitchen features unique and hilarious obstacles, from moving counters to collapsing floors.\nWindows/Mac (\n/\n)\nA soothing game that\u2019ll keep you occupied for dozens of hours. You and up to three others run a farm in a small village, carrying out tasks together or alone. Activities range from planting crops and caring for animals to fighting monsters and courting your favourite villager.\nWindows/Mac (\n/\n)\nTo make the best of a bad situation, try a game that is better when you\u2019re \n in the same place. In Tick Tock: A Tale for Two, you and the other player see different versions of the game\u2019s mystical world and must communicate effectively to solve the puzzles.\nWindows (\n)\nFor a remote movie night experience, Man of Medan\u2019s shared story mode lets two people play through a horror story together by controlling different characters. The story itself isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019ll give you something to talk about, and at about four hours long you can play in an evening.\nWindows/Mac (\n)\nWant to try your hand at ruling the world? In Civilization VI, you try to take your chosen civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age. It looks complex, but there are tutorials for beginners, and it\u2019s turn-based, so you can step away from your PC at any time.\nWindows (\n)\nRocket League is football played with rocket cars, easy to learn but with plenty of room to develop your skills. With multiple modes for different numbers of players, this will easily fit into your schedule.\nWindows/Mac (\n/\n)\nBoard game nights are not easily replaced, but we can try. \n is software that lets you play virtual board games online, but if you want to keep it simple then grab a copy of Ticket to Ride, the classic in which you compete to connect cities by rail.\nPC/Mac (\n)\nSometimes only mindless button-bashing will do. If you want to run around a fantasy land with your friends, taking out hordes of creatures with a giant sword or magic spells, levelling up and collecting loot, all without having to concentrate too hard, Diablo III is for you.\nWindows/Mac (\n)\nTo make your separation part of the game, try Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, in which one of you has to defuse a bomb and one has the manual, but neither of you can see what the other can. It\u2019s frantic, silly, and you only need one copy to play.\nWindows/Mac (\n)\nFor a bit of nostalgia, Worms W.M.D. is a more modern-looking interpretation of the classic turn-based battle between teams of worms, wacky weaponry included, from bazookas to blow torches to banana bombs. And with its cartoon violence, it won\u2019t matter if your kids glance over at your screen.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f7b43fa821d06fe1ab4311e558686529931492/168_84_1060_636/master/1060.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c9d6ad0bf00cb452e055af65aa587fa"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/doom-eternal-review": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/doom-eternal-review", "title": "Doom Eternal review \u2013 no-frills, endless thrills", "published": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:00:03 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, Xbox One; Bethesda<br></strong>The latest addition to the demon-slaying franchise is a gorgeously designed gore fest that delivers relentless fun</p><p>Picking up where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/doom-review-ludicrous-compelling-shooter-reboot-basics-original\">2016 reboot of Doom</a> left off, Doom Eternal offers the merest breath of exposition before you\u2019re handed a shotgun and required to start blasting through demons at breakneck speed.

The game\u2019s heavy-metal soundtrack urges the player onward, while the rest of the sound design offers plenty of gory rips and squelches, but also the sharp smash of a collapsing statue or the echo of the Doom Slayer\u2019s footsteps in a high-ceilinged corridor.\nBut while the previous title felt like it outstayed its welcome in the latter half, Doom Eternal never gets old despite its longer play time. Though the foundation of the fighting might be the same, there\u2019s far more variety to keep it fresh throughout. Some of that is within the combat itself, such as new enemies that require specific techniques to overcome and different kinds of encounters that put imaginative spins on the otherwise formulaic waves of increasing difficulty.\nThere are also multiple upgrade systems for weapons, abilities and suit, gained through ordinary progression as well as completing optional challenges. And Eternal intersperses the familiar scorched red wastelands or gore hives with missions that take place in ivy-wrapped ruins or snowy expanses; it\u2019s just as well that there\u2019s a photo mode to take advantage of them.\nThe game offers many quieter interludes to take in the scenery, too. Hidden secrets and mandatory platforming challenges use all of the Slayer\u2019s additional movement abilities and offer light puzzles to break up the relentless speed, cleverly pacing out the game\u2019s most intense moments.\nCombat and platforming are meticulously tuned. Hitboxes, on both enemies and grabbable walls, are forgiving enough to afford a constant sense of mastery over the building blocks of the Slayer\u2019s kit. And there are other systems in place to keep the player moving along and prevent any frustration. Difficulty modes can be switched on the fly without affecting progression, and any cheat codes found hidden away are also fine to use throughout the campaign. Dying multiple times on a boss fight unlocks the option to take hugely reduced damage. Though it\u2019s possible to crank up the difficulty and play to erase any mistake, doing so isn\u2019t necessary to enjoy the feeling of power it affords.\nFor those who do want to overcome the tougher challenges, the multiplayer \u201cbattlemode\u201d will allow players to face one another as either the Slayer or the demons. (Servers weren\u2019t available during the review period.)\nBut it\u2019s the momentum of the single-player experience that makes Doom Eternal a joy \u2013 both within fights and in the broader pacing. Though the story is vague, it doesn\u2019t matter. The Slayer\u2019s indifference to it is showcased throughout; his desire is clearly only to keep moving to end the demonic invasion. The reaction of other characters to his presence also adds some excellent comedy.\nDoom Eternal is clearly a continuation of the franchise, but it is also a clear improvement on its predecessor. Every design detail serves to propel the player forwards with as little friction as possible, with enough surprises and twists to prevent the formula becoming stale. It\u2019s a real delight to be the Doom Slayer: to put everything else aside and focus on just the problem in front of you. Especially if that problem is a swarm of angry demons.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebd31ded4723e991446ededa9e65c980f988567d/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0d2b2609f0e4489f9ff3488884f8c3a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/18/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-monsters-and-magic-stir-in-the-forest": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/18/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review-monsters-and-magic-stir-in-the-forest", "title": "Ori and the Will of the Wisps review \u2013 monsters and magic stir in the forest", "published": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 11:30:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>The soulful platformer returns to an extraordinarily beautiful world filled with new characters, challenges \u2013 and myriad foes to engage in combat </p><p>More than anything else, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an intoxicating feast for the senses.

A few hours earlier, Anna Kournikova had fallen in the first round of Wimbledon in 2002. She was ranked 55, her career plunging into a spiral as the media lapped up her losses. What followed was a painful, infamous interview. As Kournikova rolled her eyes and laughed away the leading questions, the reporter became so flustered in her presence that he asked her to do his job: \u201cWhat would you think was a good starting question?\u201d\nFew tennis players have ever replicated the frenzy that constantly surrounded Kournikova. Her arrival in the sport was soundtracked by the screams of hysterical fanboys. As she became the world\u2019s highest-paid female athlete, her most lucrative endorsement was a sports bra deal. The infamous tagline said: \u201cOnly the balls should bounce.\u201d\nBack when women in sport received even less respect than today, the discourse around Kournikova was excruciating. She was described as a \u201cteen sexpot\u201d at 16 before the writer noted that he \u201cappear[ed] to be flirting\u201d with her. By 18 she was harrowingly dubbed the \u201cJezebel of Sweat\u201d. The Sun once promised to publish \u201ca photo of Anna every day\u201d. Meanwhile it seemed every last Kournikova article was mandated to use the world \u201cflirt\u201d.\nKournikova could be snotty, rude, and a nightmare for WTA staff but she perfected the art of stirring the pot; by her 18th birthday she had been linked with the Russian hockey stars Pavel Bure, then aged 28, and Sergei Fedorov, aged 30. When informed in Sports Illustrated that some disapproved of the age of her suitors, she doubled down: \u201cEvery country I visit, I have a different boyfriend,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I kiss them all.\u201d\nThis month marks exactly 20 years since Kournikova broke into the world\u2019s top 10, yet people primarily associate her playing career with the gloom reflected in \n and remember her as a terrible player known only for her glamour. Her name is offered as a cautionary tale and her career has slowly morphed into one of the great sporting punchlines. She may have earned all of that money, they say, but she sure couldn\u2019t buy herself a title.\nThe focus on Kournikova\u2019s title count is unhelpful. She was a solid athlete with a crisp all-court game who excelled from modest beginnings in Moscow. She beat Steffi Graf, Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, reached a Wimbledon semi-final in 1997 at 16, and became doubles No 1 in 1999. Kournikova\u2019s popularity may have been rooted in her blond hair and her looks, but she still enjoyed a career that most tennis players dream of.\nIn the years since, Kournikova has influenced much more than just her own career and her rise inspired greater feats. In 2004, a year after Kournikova\u2019s final match, a trio of Russian women \u2013 Anastasia Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova \u2013 won Russia\u2019s first three slam titles consecutively. Since then, women\u2019s tennis has thrived across former Soviet nations.\nThe two greatest Russian players feel her influence deeply. Sharapova spent her youth renouncing the unending comparisons with Kournikova, but Kournikova was still the blueprint. Sharapova followed her lead from Russia to the Bollettieri Academy in Florida, she frequently wore Kournikova\u2019s hand-me-downs, and built a similar portfolio of endorsements: \u201cI knew I needed to get past Kournikova,\u201d Sharapova wrote in her autobiography. \u201cWhen I did that, I\u2019d be judged on my own terms.\u201d\nWhen asked to name the most influential Russian tennis players, Kuznetsova was clear. \u201cAnna Kournikova is No 1 for sure,\u201d she told WTA Insider. \u201cFor me, she brought really big popularity to Russian tennis, women\u2019s tennis. Everyone after her was just after her. For me, she was a big, huge push \u2026 Everybody was saying she never won a tournament, hee hee ha ha. I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, have you been to the top 10? Have you ever held a racket?\u2019\u201d\nIn the mid-90s, women\u2019s tennis was in such a rut that Martina Navratilova called the tour \u201cSteffi and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d. In one heave, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Martina Hingis and Kournikova exploded on to the tour like supernovas and changed the game for good with their combined swagger, marketability and mutual resentment. Women\u2019s tennis has always been an outlier among women\u2019s sports, the one willing to cynically (and successfully) use glamour and sexuality to advance its brand. The way Kournikova marketed herself, attracted attention and was surrounded by agents helped to shape the game as it became increasingly more professional in the 2010s.\nIn the end, Kournikova\u2019s flame burned brightly and swiftly. By 2003, aged only 22, she injured her back and she was done. The question that always accompanied Kournikova was what would happen when she grew older and the cameras had found someone else to permanently train their lenses on.\nPerhaps her greatest achievement, then, is what she didn\u2019t become. Instead of desperately attempting to consolidate her fame in retirement or struggling to adjust in the absence of an adoring crowd, she simply departed on her own route. After commanding the most public-facing career tennis has seen, she lives the most private life today. She recently gave birth to a third child. She seems to be happy. We will probably never know.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4bf20d3b9939853259b775790625f360f8a290b/469_329_2642_1585/master/2642.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f434c20e3c5f68c5ece3c166489730d"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/jimmy-anderson-no-plans-retire-england-cricket-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/jimmy-anderson-no-plans-retire-england-cricket-coronavirus", "title": "Jimmy Anderson has no plans to retire even if England's summer is wiped out", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:00:34 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>\u2018I\u2019ve not thought about never playing again,\u2019 says 37-year-old<br></li><li>Bowler believes starting West Indies Test on 4 June is unrealistic<br></li></ul><p>Jimmy Anderson has given no thought to the prospect of having bowled his last ball in Test cricket and will plough on through to 2021 if that is what the coronavirus pandemic dictates.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/ecb-steve-elworthy-cricket-coronavirus\">Covid-19 checkpoints a possibility as ECB considers staging internationals</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/jimmy-anderson-no-plans-retire-england-cricket-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": " has given no thought to the prospect of having bowled his last ball in Test cricket and will plough on through to 2021 if that is what the coronavirus pandemic dictates.\nEngland\u2019s record wicket-taker turns 38 in July and so could be feeling the indefinite hiatus more than most, not least having played only three Tests in the past 12 months because of injury. However speaking on Thursday, via conference call, Anderson said: \u201cI\u2019ve not actually thought about never playing cricket again. I feel like we will play again and I will play again at some stage.\n\u201cI\u2019m still hungry to play, I\u2019ve still got ambitions to play for England. So I think that\u2019s going to keep me driven at home trying to keep fit, so that whenever it is we play again I\u2019m ready to go. Whether it\u2019s this summer or the winter [England play five Tests in India] my plan is to try and get back into that team.\n\u201cYou need a bit of perspective. People are sacrificing a hell of a lot to try and keep us healthy. Us sacrificing some of \u2013 maybe all of \u2013 the cricket season and staying inside for a bit, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s huge. When I do get to play again I\u2019m really going to cherish it and enjoy every single moment.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s first Test of the summer against West Indies is slated to begin on 4 June although with no cricket before 28 May \u2013 a date likely to be pushed back \u2013 Anderson thinks going straight into an international match is unrealistic, not least for seam bowlers short on overs.\nThough fully recovered from the \n early \u2013 after taking his 28th Test five-wicket haul in Cape Town at the start of the year \u2013 Anderson is unable to bowl off his full run-up during the current lockdown because of a lack of garden space. Instead he has been working on bowling-specific exercises and getting the competitive juices flowing by racing Stuart Broad and Mark Wood on Peloton bikes via an online link-up.\nAnderson added: \u201cWorking out can be difficult. Generally when we\u2019re training we always have a goal in mind. Without that it can be quite difficult to find drive and motivation. I have been walking around the last couple of days just going through my action in the living room \u2013 it\u2019s sort of ingrained. When you don\u2019t do it for a while you miss it and subconsciously your body just wants to do it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely need some kind of buildup. You can\u2019t expect to just start the season after a couple of weeks\u2019 notice. Guys who have been sat around for a long time \u2013 and some players might have been ill as well \u2013 need some sort of buildup. You can\u2019t go from not bowling at all to then having to bowl in a Test match at short notice. Obviously the powers that be will sort that out if and when that happens.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0c0ab26521fa7652d54fc6650821f88c34ccca6/0_127_2096_1257/master/2096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7a857b8ff9a7952fded1f29e4676758"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/wage-cut-row-intensifies-as-premiership-players-take-legal-advice": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/wage-cut-row-intensifies-as-premiership-players-take-legal-advice", "title": "Wage cut row intensifies as Premiership players take legal advice", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:43:39 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Players object to 25% reduction in salary</li><li>RPA union giving guidance to members</li></ul><p>Premiership players have been given legal advice on how to challenge the blanket 25% pay cuts imposed by the clubs as domestic rugby\u2019s row over wage reductions intensified on Thursday.</p><p>In the Championship, Newcastle Falcons have been plunged into turmoil with their players expected to reject their proposed swingeing pay cuts.

In the Premiership the Guardian also understands the entire \n Tigers squad is strongly considering rejecting the 25% reduction after the Rugby Players\u2019 Association provided legal guidance to its 700+ members.\n, currently top of the Championship but still unsure if they will be promoted next season, on Thursday asked all their players and staff to agree to be put on furlough \u2013 unpaid leave save for the \u00a32,500 a month available as part of the government\u2019s bailout \u2013 and a deadline of midday on Friday to respond.\nIt is understood the squad was then offered wage top-ups meaning those earning over \u00a375,000 a year would receive 50% of their wages while those on \u00a337,500 to \u00a375,000 would get the equivalent of \u00a337,500. It is believed that without further improvements it will be rejected however, potentially leaving the Falcons in considerable financial strife after the RFU announced last week that all of this season\u2019s competitions below the Premiership would be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn a letter sent by the Newcastle director of rugby, Dean Richards, and seen by the Guardian, staff are told they are expected to agree to the measures and warned that redundancies may be necessary if they do not.\nIn the Premiership meanwhile, an increasing number of players are set to challenge the 25% cuts imposed across the league. As reported by the Guardian, there is growing unrest, particularly among players whose contracts expire over the summer, and a sense of dismay that individual circumstances and varying salaries were not being taken into account.\nIn a letter seen by the Guardian, the RPA has provided players with guidance on how to \u201creserve your position\u201d in order to strengthen future claims for unlawful deduction of wages if pay is withheld. The RPA also acknowledges that some clubs have \u201csimply told players the cut is happening\u201d rather than undertaking a consultation process and it is believed that, now armed with legal guidance, an increasing number of players will not accept the 25% reduction.\nThe RPA\u2019s lawyers advise the union\u2019s members who do not want to accept the reduction to write to their clubs, informing them that the imposed cuts are \u201c a breach of contract and I reserve my rights in full to claim my full contractual entitlements. I will continue to honour my playing contract duties and will make a decision in due course, when I have sufficient information to allow me to make an informed decision.\n\u201cMy continued performance of my playing contract longer term should not be considered to amount to any implied acceptance of any reduction in my pay, and I reserve my rights to claim my entitlements that I initially accepted under my contract if this proves necessary.\u201d\nThe guidance goes on to add that \u201cregardless of this approach, the club will most likely go ahead and still apply a pay reduction but you will have reserved your right to claim your contractual entitlements at a later date should you wish.\u201d\nMeanwhile, \n has agreed a pay cut in excess of 25% to his \u00a3750,000 salary, after the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, revealed he and the rest of the union\u2019s five-strong executive team would be doing so.\nJones, who is currently in Japan, immediately agreed to the cut \u2013 which amounts to more than \u00a3187,500 a year \u2013 with the RFU estimating it will lose up to \u00a350m in the next 18 months. \u201cEddie is overseas at present and when I contacted him regarding our executive pay reduction proposals he immediately agreed,\u201d said Sweeney.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee82c095261ff86954f448a744eade57b649d0cd/0_133_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=303f34213657a843ee1bf5535ea6df0a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/ecb-steve-elworthy-cricket-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/ecb-steve-elworthy-cricket-coronavirus", "title": "Covid-19 checkpoints a possibility as ECB considers staging internationals", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Isolation units could be a feature at grounds this summer</li><li>ECB\u2019s Steve Elworthy looking into behind-closed-doors matches</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Coronavirus testing checkpoints and isolation units could become features at grounds around the country this summer as English cricket explores the possibility of staging major matches behind closed doors.</p><p>As it stands there will be no professional cricket in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\" title=\"\">before 28 May at the earliest</a>, and the England and Wales Cricket Board is drafting possible schedules while it waits for the government to give sporting events the green light.

There is no guarantee that crowds will be allowed in to grounds when this comes, however. When announcing the delay last week the ECB revealed it was looking into \u201cstarting the season behind closed doors\u201d and \u201cgiving sports fans the opportunity to watch live broadcast action\u201d.\nSteve Elworthy, the tournament director for last year\u2019s World Cup who has since become the ECB\u2019s director of events, is charged with exploring the logistics of this and has outlined the challenge. \u201cWe\u2019re mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors,\u201d Elworthy says.\n\u201cThe advice around mass gatherings [before the current period of lockdown] was 500 people or fewer. That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.\n\u201cYou would likely have to work within that number, which includes teams, match officials, support staff, broadcasters and media, commercial partners, safety and security teams, third-party suppliers, replay screen operators, [the teams that control] the LED boards, ground staff, catering and more. \n\u201cThen you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear. So it\u2019s how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are all the considerations we are thinking about.\u201d\nThe ECB\u2019s medical team is devising a protocol for how testing would work, as well as possible isolation booths for temporary use while anyone testing positive for Covid-19 waits to leave the ground. There can be around 1,500 people working on a normal major matchday, but it is believed this headcount can be shrunk to some 350 with no spectators, aided by the reduction in stewards and catering.\nHowever, Elworthy\u2019s events team must also consider transport and accommodation logistics for players, staff and officials in a way that ensures the desired \u201csterile\u201d bubble is not only upon arrival at the stadium. While operational manuals for staging domestic cricket behind closed doors will also be produced, internationals have the added complication of travel for the touring teams. Much hinges on the resumption of flights and the lifting of travel restrictions, such as quarantine periods.\nThere are four sets of visitors scheduled in the men\u2019s game this year \u2013 West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland \u2013 each with scheduling issues to consider should fixtures need moving, while England\u2019s women are due to host South Africa and India.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now thinking of all these things, the risks posed, and it just gets bigger and wider,\u201d Elworthy says. \u201cBut if that is the situation we are faced with then we will deliver on absolutely every single one of those to make sure it does happen.\u201d\nThe \n, at the start of a new \u00a31.1bn rights deal and with cash reserves greatly diminished, is clearly desperate to get cricket back on for its broadcast partners and sponsors, but Elworthy insists the decision to stage matches will not be blinded by the economic need.\n\u201cOne thing you have to consider is the national mood. You might be able to deliver a match but would it be the right thing? Operationally we believe we can deliver anything but we have to have an eye on that. You don\u2019t just operate in a bubble, you need peripheral vision.\n\u201c[And] making sure everyone is in a safe environment is front and centre of the discussions. We have had good conversations with the new chief exec of the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association, Tony Irish, as well as county directors of cricket. Player and official safety and comfort is paramount.\u201d\nA veteran of six global tournaments stretching back to the 2007 World T20 in South Africa, and awarded an MBE in 2018, Elworthy says the current situation is \u201cwithout a shadow of a doubt\u201d the most challenging he has faced, not least because the start date and length of the 2020 season remain unknown.\nHis team was not totally blindsided, at least, with the subject of a global pandemic arising during contingency planning for last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup \u2013 \u201cthe issue of bird flu came up, as an example\u201d \u2013 even though terrorism was considered the greatest threat to the tournament at the time.\nUnlike a global event that has a rigid window in the international calendar, a home summer at least provides scope for flexibility (barring a fully cancelled season). There are, however, four domestic competitions to be staged: the County Championship, the T20 Blast, the One-Day Cup and the Hundred.\nOne or more may be forced to lie fallow for a year as the ECB prioritises the money-spinning white-ball formats but the viability of the Hundred\u2019s inaugural season is about more than its ability to generate cash. Intended to inject fresh impetus into the sport, the 100-ball competition may yet be better served by a 12-month delay given the potential crowd restrictions and loss of overseas stars.\nElworthy, who will oversee its delivery, is not blind to the challenges here but is reluctant to be drawn on its immediate future. \u201cNo one has a crystal ball. We know what the Hundred is intended for and the power of what it can deliver. There will be considerations for all competitions and a process to go through but I would be hesitant to write off anything at this stage.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll get the green light to get back on and playing. You must make sure you have done all your critical thinking and planning so when you reach that point and know how much season is left, you deliver as much cricket as possible and as coherently as possible.\n\u201cOne thing you can guarantee is that sport is one of the greatest unifiers. We will come out of this and it will be front and centre of pulling the country together. That\u2019s the power of sport and cricket has a huge role to play in that.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db43b64d2c6ee7a9761639969564f47d07227ab4/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=516c153c26b2d9e4fe89f122fcc2b3db"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/mar/26/sid-lowe-on-sid-lowe-football-weekly-extra": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/mar/26/sid-lowe-on-sid-lowe-football-weekly-extra", "title": "Sid Lowe on Sid Lowe \u2013 Football Weekly Extra", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:12:08 GMT", "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxrushden\">Max Rushden</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe\">Sid Lowe</a> discuss...

The issue will then be discussed when the 20 top-flight clubs hold their next video conference on 3 April and while there is an acceptance that players will balk at taking permanent wage cuts, it is expected that they will agree to have their pay deferred.\nClubs are expected to adopt the measures as a collective instead of taking unilateral action. There is a desire to make major savings while games are suspended, with one source saying that clubs are concerned about running into cashflow problems. Clubs are missing out on gate receipts and other match revenue and they also expect to make significantly less money if games resume behind closed doors.\nAn executive at one club has told the Guardian that laying off people in non-playing departments would barely scratch the surface when so much is spent on paying players. Although sources have said that some players will not be happy about not getting their full wage, it has also been pointed out that Premier League players earn enough not to encounter short-term financial difficulties. Several agents believe the move is inevitable.\nPremier League owners have seen players in the Football League take cuts. Leeds United, who are top of the Championship, have announced that their players, coaching staff and senior management have volunteered to take a wage deferral to ensure non-football staff can continue to be paid. Leeds hope that the savings will also allow them to pay their casual staff and the move comes after Birmingham City asked their players to defer half of their salaries for the next four months.\nThe impact of Covid-19 is not only being felt in England. Barcelona, top of the Spanish league, remain in talks with their players about taking 70% pay cuts.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2197aaf2ae6aa59a8ce444cf7c7f31181b703514/0_43_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57dbe874ddc4d71584473209314403a4"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/chess-candidates-stopped-after-russia-suspends-air-traffic": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/chess-candidates-stopped-after-russia-suspends-air-traffic", "title": "Chess: Candidates stopped at midway point after Russia suspends air traffic", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:08:23 GMT", "summary": "France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave led after seven of the planned 14 rounds, as global body Fide plans a later resumption with points already scored still counting<p>The world championship Candidates in Ekaterinburg was abruptly stopped on Thursday morning, with seven of 14 rounds played, after the Russian government announced that international air traffic would be suspended from Friday.

Whether coronavirus will permit this schedule remains to be seen.\nThe Candidates had been the only global sports event to continue under the threat of the virus. The eight GMs had daily medical checks, and the games were played behind closed doors. They could still be watched online, and with no competition from other sports chess sites reported a surge in viewers.\nSeven of the 14 rounds have been completed, and these scores will stand when it becomes possible to resume the postponed tournament. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) led with 4.5/7, ahead of Fabiano Caruana (US), Anish Giri (Netherlands), Alexander Grischuk (Russia) and Wang Hao (China) all 3.5/7, Kirill Alekseenko (Russia) and Ding Liren (China) 2.5/7.\nVachier-Lagrave was a late substitute after Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan withdrew, but the Frenchman played well and scored a \n over Nepomniachtchi in the seventh round,especially as head-to-head is the first criterion in a tie-break situation.\nThe Winawer French 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Bb4 is rare nowadays in top-class tournaments, but Vachier-Lagrave was ready for it as his opponent had already used it earlier in the tournament and might be tempted to use the French Defence against a Frenchman.\nSeventy years ago the French was the staple weapon for Mikhail Botvinnik in his title matches against Vassily Smyslov,and the patriarch also used it against lesser lights, even against myself at Hastings 1961-62. Most present day grandmasters distrust the French as too passive, and reasons for this emerged in the game. White\u2019s AlphaZero-inspired advance of Harry the h pawn was met by an ugly defensive front of Kf8/Rg8, while Black\u2019s central lock c5-c4 was mistimed.White took advantage by opening up the f file and infiltrating via the strong 35 Qa1!\nDing and Caruana were the pre-tournament favourites, but China\u2019s No 1 is too far behind to recover. The weeks of lockdown in his home city of Wenzhou followed by two weeks quarantine in Moscow took their psychological toll. Ding lost three games, contrasting with the 2018 Candidates where he was unbeaten and his record, later surpassed by Carlsen, of 100 elite games unbeaten\nCaruana was also subdued despite appearing with a full repertoire of planned opening surprises. The world No 2 so is still only one point behind the leaders, and has the favourable white pieces against Vachier-Lagrave in round eight. If round eight ever happens.\n 1 Rhe8 g5 2 Rd2!

After hearing Roberts preach at Kenfig Hill, one player announced to the congregation: \u201cI used to play full-back for the Devil but now I am forward for God.\u201d\nMorristown, Penygroes, Crynant, Ammanford and Senghenydd were among the clubs who suspended playing, prompting a visiting Frenchman, Jacques Rogues de Fursac, who had been commissioned by his government to report on the revival, to conclude that the Welsh temperament swung wildly from one extreme to another, a view Graham Henry was to echo more than 90 years later.\nBefore the revival, Wales had come under pressure from some of its Four Nations rivals for conniving at professionalism. Ireland especially felt the Welsh had an advantage over the rest because many of their players were working class, gaining fitness and strength through their occupations.\nWales won the triple crown in Dublin that year and Smith and Williams quote from a subsequent meeting of the Irish Rugby Football Union in Cork when a rise in admission prices was proposed to keep out the roughs.\n\u201cLast year, the Welsh fellows broke in all over the ground and smashed up everything they could lay their hands upon,\u201d said the union\u2019s treasurer, who pointed out \u00a350 had been paid for a dinner in Scotland\u2019s honour but only \u00a330 for Wales. \u201cThe reason for this was that champagne was given to the Scotsmen and beer only (but plenty of it) to the Welshmen. The Scotsmen were gentlemen and appreciated a dinner when it was given to them. Not so the Welshmen.\u201d\nThe revival changed behaviour. Convictions for drunkenness fell by 50%, several pubs went bankrupt and the historian J Edwin Orr noted: \u201cCrime was so diminished that judges were presented with white gloves signifying there were no cases of murder, assault, rape or robbery to consider. The police became unemployed in many districts and stoppages occurred in coal mines not because of any unpleasantness between management and workers but because so many foul-mouthed miners became converted and stopped (swearing) that the horses which handled the coal trucks in the mines could no longer understand what was being said to them.\u201d\nThirteen months after the revival started, Wales beat New Zealand at Cardiff Arms Park. The 3-0 defeat was the only setback on the All Blacks\u2019 35-match tour of the four home unions and France that ended five months after it had started with two romps in California. Rugby developed a religious fervour in the country, a \u201ccollective bid for Paradise rather than an individual dash for heaven was what came,\u201d as Smith and Williams put it.\n\u201cThere was a semi-religious, almost fanatical invocation in the fervour when the great assembly (prompted by the Wales team who sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau after the haka) it was not the country\u2019s national anthem then but soon was) took up the strain: the Land of My fathers, the Land of the Free,\u201d wrote a reporter at the match. The singing, said the New Zealand captain Dave Gallagher, had more to do with his side\u2019s defeat than anything else that happened.\u201d\nBy the end of the decade, wrote Williams, \u201crugby football, along with coal, hymns (Cwm Rhondda was adopted as a battle-hymn of Welsh rugby crowds during Roberts\u2019s revival) and Lloyd George signalled the full blown arrival of Wales into the modern world.\u201d By 1911, Wales had won 35 of their past 43 internationals, securing the triple crown six times, taking off along with the country\u2019s economy but suffering when there was a downturn in the 1920s and 20% of the population left the country to find work elsewhere.\nThe revival may have shut down some clubs rather than the game itself but it opened eyes and minds. The current position is far different but sport, at some point, will resume. If it can capture the collective spirit that was Roberts\u2019s legacy, with the various strands that make up rugby working together rather than pre-occupied with self-interest, it will be the stronger for it.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be5d7906a4d1085c1b09c54fb771439f64c2d8da/0_241_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=965b04979ca1e530dedf233b8b8bb18b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/how-you-staying-active-keeping-fit-during-lockdown-coronavirus-football": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/how-you-staying-active-keeping-fit-during-lockdown-coronavirus-football", "title": "How are you staying active and keeping fit during lockdown?", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:35:58 GMT", "summary": "<p>The great outdoors is off limits for many us during the pandemic, so how are you getting your fix of activity?</p><p>It takes some ingenuity to keep fit and healthy while gyms are closed, sporting events are cancelled and there are limits on how long we can spend outdoors.

And as a result, unfortunately three of our team have now tested positive.\u201d\nThe Olympic boxing qualifying tournament in London \u2013 which featured around 350 fighters from 40 countries \u2013 was suspended after three days owing to concerns over the virus and the impact on athletes\u2019 travel arrangements. But even while it was taking place, Franco Falcinelli, the European Boxing Confederation president, warned that the risk of a boxer contracting the virus was \u201cvery high\u201d.\nGozgec, who is also the vice-president of the European Boxing Confederation, said he would be writing to the IOC to make a complaint, adding there was not enough medical precautions either at the venue or the hotel where the fighters stayed. He has also sent a letter to other federations, seen by the Guardian, in which he makes his frustrations clear.\n\u201cUnfortunately, two of our athletes and our Turkish head coach have tested positive for the new type Covid-19 coronavirus after returning to Turkey from London,\u201d he writes. \u201cAll of them are in treatment now and thankfully they are in good condition. This is the disastrous result of the irresponsibility of the IOC taskforce.\n\u201cThis virus has been around since December 2019. Therefore, it is inevitable to ask why the European qualification event was not postponed before it even took place? They did not consider anyone\u2019s health, which led them to organise this horrible event.\u201d\nGozgec also claimed the event had left the countries involved out of pocket. \u201cWhile they requested a full upfront payment from all of us boxing federations in Europe for 15 days, they cancelled the events after three days.

The club have said they are waiting on one last result for a member of the backroom team.\nAll five of the \n personnel to test positive have been players \u2013 Sean Raggett, James Bolton, Ross McCrorie, Haji Mnoga and Andy Cannon \u2013 and it means the club have become the first in British football to confirm multiple members of their squad have the virus.\nThere is a sliver of good news, and goodness knows we need it. Gallen says the players, who are in isolation, are not suffering. \u201cThey are all feeling reasonably good,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of them said that he\u2019d lost his sense of smell, which has been mentioned now as a symptom, and two of the others \u2026 you could call them as having a cold or a cough. They were all surprised to hear they had it \u2013 very surprised. Symptoms-wise, there weren\u2019t many flowing around our squad at all.\u201d\nIt is nevertheless impossible to shake the slightly unreal feeling that has enveloped the club. Two weeks ago they were in the thick of it, having just played their 50th game of the season \u2013 the 2-2 home draw with Fleetwood in the league. It was their sixth match in 18 days and left them fourth in the division, two points off automatic promotion.\nAfter a slow start to the season \u2013 Portsmouth were fourth from bottom at the end of September \u2013 they have won 16 of 30 league games, drawing six \u2013 and also reached the EFL Trophy final for the second season in succession. \n. The run to the fifth round of the FA Cup and that tie against Arsenal, which they lost 2-0, was a further source of pride. But now the virus has gripped and uncertainty reigns.\n\u201cWhen we were told we were going to shut down on 13 March, it was a huge disappointment,\u201d Gallen says. \u201cBut after a bit of sober reflection, you do start to think that football does seem a bit irrelevant. It\u2019s such a difference to wanting to be successful and win to, oh, hang on a minute, there\u2019s other things going on that are miles more important.\u201d\nLike everybody in the game, Gallen is kicking his heels at home, following the news and just waiting. \u201cI was trying to think of a way of doing training and keeping everyone two metres apart [for social distancing],\u201d he says, with a smile. \u201cHow does that work on set pieces? It would be very difficult to train. How do you do it? Basically, you can\u2019t.\u201d\nWhen will Portsmouth train again? Gallen does not know. But what does look increasingly clear to him is that the proposed return-to-competition date of 1 May is fanciful. How can it be anything else when Boris Johnson announced at least three weeks of lockdown on Monday?\n\u201cEveryone is thinking that\u2019s not going to be the date,\u201d Gallen says. \u201cIf it is, then we\u2019ll prepare accordingly, but I\u2019m pretty sure that we won\u2019t be playing games on that date.\u201d\nGallen\u2019s thoughts have turned towards his players\u2019 fitness and their readiness to resume after the hiatus. He believes it would not take them as long as many people think.\n\u201cWhen you finish in May, you normally get six to eight weeks off,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as soon as the players start to come back, they are usually into a certain shape after two and a half weeks. The players are keeping themselves fit at the moment and the thing to say is that players do look after themselves, even during the off-season. Invariably, most come back fit. They just do \u2013 at every level. It\u2019s their job to stay fit. So my opinion, based on 20 years [as a coach], is that the players will be up to speed in two or two and a half weeks.\u201d\nThere is the caveat of match fitness. \u201cMost coaches, managers and players would say that if we were to do 10 days of fitness work, on that first game, most players would be blowing out of their proverbials after 20 minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to get match fit is to play competitive matches. It\u2019s pretty obvious but you\u2019d be amazed how some people think it\u2019s anything but that.\u201d\nFootball faces tough choices and one of them could be whether to attempt to finish the season with games behind closed doors. Gallen says it would be a nightmare for supporters but, if the alternative were to be voiding the leagues, he would give it his blessing.\n\u201cIf this season doesn\u2019t restart and Liverpool don\u2019t get the Premier League trophy, that would be heartbreaking,\u201d Gallen says. \u201cIf there was any opportunity to get the season done and dusted, that would be better than just leaving it and I\u2019d say that with a heavy heart if the fans were not allowed to attend. It would stop a lot of arguments, a lot of lawyers.\n\u201cThe thing I would also say is if we all do right by the government and follow their instructions, we\u2019ll be able to get our football season back quicker than if we don\u2019t. If everyone just carries on going about their business, it\u2019s going to be longer.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06429d4e427e6843bc58548ae4bd5becdab5b811/0_286_5189_3114/master/5189.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=65d2597bce3ecbc4f6c8cabe85b67b50"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/25/eddie-jones-to-be-asked-to-take-pay-cut-with-rfu-set-for-50m-losses": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/25/eddie-jones-to-be-asked-to-take-pay-cut-with-rfu-set-for-50m-losses", "title": "Eddie Jones to be asked to take pay cut with RFU set for \u00a350m losses", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 20:15:04 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Coronavirus having massive financial impact on RFU</li><li>Cuts may affect Jones\u2019s contract extension talks</li></ul><p>Eddie Jones will be asked to take a pay cut after the Rugby Football Union revealed it is set to lose up to \u00a350m owing to the disruption caused by coronavirus.

When we do not stage matches and events we do not generate revenue.\u201d\nThe RFU has announced measures to support grassroots clubs whose seasons have been cancelled.

The sun always seemed to shine at Wembley, the two finalists generally rose to the challenge of presenting the game in its best light given space and a billiard table surface, and the happy memories would last all summer until it was time to visit places such as Odsal and Wilderspool again.\nThe 1985 final between Hull and Wigan certainly delivered on happy memories. Frank Keating on these very pages described it as the most voluptuous exhibition of running rugby he had ever witnessed. Note: not rugby league. He just said rugby. It was the 50th final staged at Wembley, and a procession on the pitch before kick-off featured players or representatives from each winning side down the years. All the old-timers agreed afterwards that the final was one of the most exciting and memorable contests the sport had produced.\nWigan won, though another five minutes and Hull\u2019s magnificent fightback might have secured victory. The peerless Wigan stand-off Brett Kenny was a deserving Lance Todd trophy winner as man of the match \u2013 though, had the votes been counted at the end of the game rather than 15 minutes before its conclusion, his equally deserving Parramatta and Australia teammate Peter Sterling would have been in with a shout.\nSterling led the Hull comeback, Kenny was the inspiration behind most of the spectacular tries that propelled Wigan towards taking a seemingly commanding 28-12 lead. The pair had made their names in this country three years earlier as half-back partners for the invincible Kangaroo tourists, now they had been eagerly snapped up on short contracts by adventurous English clubs keen to import their dazzling brand of youth and vigour.\nIt could be argued the 1985 final was merely the first to be thus enlivened after the relaxing of an international transfer ban a couple of years earlier, though few occasions in the era of free movement since have managed to be as colourful or pulsating. Nor was the Kenny-Sterling rivalry the only thing to admire.\nOn one Wigan wing was the incredible John Ferguson, a hitherto unknown Indigenous Australian whose prodigious talent was only recognised by international selectors in his homeland after the two typically improbable tries he scored at Wembley. On the other was Henderson Gill, a muscular and elusive runner from Huddersfield who had endured a miserable time in the final defeat by Widnes the previous year.\nFor this was not the Wigan who would sweep all before them a few years later, winning the Challenge Cup eight years on the trot. Far from it, at this point in their history Wigan had not won at Wembley since 1965, when Billy Boston and Brian McTigue were still playing. Hull, with a young Garry Schofield and Lee Crooks in their side, were considered narrow favourites beforehand, although keeping Schofield under wraps until the second half was probably a mistake.\nGill scored arguably the try of the afternoon, hurtling half the length of the left touchline before lighting up the stadium with a radiant grin, though Kenny\u2019s exquisitely controlled glide for his first-half score was just as stunning. The goal-kicking was poor throughout, indeed some Hull supporters still claim the final was lost for want of a specialist kicker, though it is also true that Wigan forced Hull out wide for their tries and were never opened up through the middle as was the case when Shaun Edwards scored.\nWhile neither he nor his teammate Mike Ford would have had any inkling that their futures lay in rugby union, the most decorated player in rugby league history will always have a soft spot for 1985. Of the record 37 medals Edwards amassed, this was the first.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0b003889754cccfe5eea8ad281480ac0cf1f9c/464_111_3536_2520/master/3536.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=547f132fef8514842894eecfcd45ffda"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/marching-on-together-bielsa-and-leeds-show-team-spirit-as-wait-goes-on": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/marching-on-together-bielsa-and-leeds-show-team-spirit-as-wait-goes-on", "title": "Marching on together: Bielsa and Leeds show team spirit as wait goes on", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>The manager, squad and coaching staff have accepted wage deferrals to help others as football takes a back seat</p><p>The plinth supporting the landmark statue of Billy Bremner outside Elland Road bears a simple, yet evocative, message. \u201cSide before self, every time,\u201d it declares, reminding everyone of the former Leeds United captain\u2019s personal mantra.</p><p>In a very different way and a very different context, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds are now showing they are every bit as big on teamwork as the trophy-hoarding, no-quarter-given Don Revie side Bremner led with such a memorable mixture of finesse and ferocity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/marching-on-together-bielsa-and-leeds-show-team-spirit-as-wait-goes-on\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "he plinth supporting the landmark statue of Billy Bremner outside Elland Road bears a simple, yet evocative, message. \u201cSide before self, every time,\u201d it declares, reminding everyone of the former \n captain\u2019s personal mantra.\nIn a very different way and a very different context, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds are now showing they are every bit as big on teamwork as the trophy-hoarding, no-quarter-given Don Revie side Bremner led with such a memorable mixture of finesse and ferocity.\nThe \n leaders\u2019 reaction to being stuck in a coronavirus emergency-induced holding pattern with the Premier League clearly visible on the horizon has been impressively mature and measured. On Thursday Bielsa, his players, senior coaching staff and club executives accepted a wage deferral in order to protect the jobs and incomes of 272 less well remunerated members of the club\u2019s backroom staff and its army of casual workers. Other teams are now expected to follow suit.\nBremner was, aptly described as \u201c10 stone of barbed wire\u201d on the pitch but he would surely have approved of the current Leeds captain Liam Cooper\u2019s role in negotiating an arrangement designed to prevent the loss of homes and livelihoods. In the absence of the customary 35,000 matchday crowds at Elland Road Leeds are, according to their chief executive, Angus Kinnear, losing \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d per month.\nWith a \u00a340m annual wage bill becoming unsustainable, first-teamers have agreed to their wages being temporarily capped \u2013 a reduction to a sum in the region of \u00a36,000 a week was discussed in recent days \u2013 leaving the balance to come when normality is finally restored. While the average Championship salary is around \u00a312,000 per week, Bielsa\u2019s top earners, Patrick Bamford and Kiko Casilla, command around \u00a330,000.\nNever in Leeds\u2019s 16-year top-flight exile has it been more imperative to secure a Premier League return, with its attendant, \u00a3100m broadcast revenue-funded cash infusion. However, given the lives being lost and the economic crash, the club is not about to feel sorry for itself.\nTop of the second tier and seven points clear of the play-off places with nine games to go, the players could be forgiven for feeling like weary travellers left circling their destination in thick cloud. An awful lot of hard work \u2013 mental as well as physical \u2013 has gone into reaching this position but the bigger picture has been grasped.\nAlready Bielsa\u2019s squad have donated sufficient money to prevent the largely matchday-funded Leeds fans\u2019 food bank from folding, while individual players, most notably Cooper and Stuart Dallas, have gone into role-model mode, using social media to promote social distancing. Holbeck Together, a local charity helping the elderly, has received the club\u2019s entire food stocks.\nCooper and company can only hope the Elland Road larders will be refilled and the season eventually concluded with the team still in the top two. No one wants the current campaign to be voided, with promotion and relegation either suspended for a year or Leeds and second-placed West Brom becoming part of a temporarily extended 22-club top tier. Not playing is bad but the uncertainty about what happens next is worse.\nOr at least so it initially seemed. Daniel Chapman, co-editor of the Square Ball fanzine, encapsulates a now almost unimaginably altered mood among the fans.\n\u201cTwo weeks ago the idea of calling off the season had everyone saying \u2018Typical Leeds\u2019,\u201d wrote Chapman in the Yorkshire Evening Post. \u201cThat\u2019s gone. Any defiance the mirror now shows is mostly wide-eyed fear as I think less often of promotion. The death tolls from Italy are of a scale that can be mapped on to blocks of seating at Elland Road. The notion of the virus being \u2018typically Leeds\u2019 seems absurd now that we can appreciate its global impact on our increasingly local lives.\u201d\nIf and when the Championship campaign resumes Leeds must regain the momentum that was serving them so well. Given the likelihood of playing behind closed doors, they will surely have to do this without their adrenaline-supplying supporters and their incessant \u201cMarching on Together\u201d soundtrack. What effect might that have? And how might a layoff involving players training alone at home influence a team whose high-intensity style demands unusually hard, highly intricate daily training-ground drilling.\nBielsa\u2019s squad went into lockdown with personalised exercise plans, sleep monitoring devices and diet sheets complementing deliveries of exercise bikes and other gym equipment to players\u2019 homes. Daily weigh-ins and body fat monitoring are now undertaken electronically, with the results taken on trust.\nAll head coaches are control freaks to varying extents but for a micro-manager as obsessive as the Argentinian to suddenly be forced into taking such a hands-off approach at a time like this must be particularly disorientating. As his squad cycle and run along Yorkshire\u2019s country roads \u2013 especially those surrounding the footballers\u2019 mecca of Linton, near the market town of Wetherby \u2013 what on earth does Bielsa do? How does he fill the time normally occupied by his famous daily dust inspection at the club\u2019s Thorp Arch training ground.\nDespite his family remaining in Argentina, he has opted to stay on at his modest flat in Wetherby. Bielsa now has little option but to indulge his passions for reading, taking long walks through the adjacent fields he has come to love and, above all, playing an active role in WhatsApp groups created by the players, coaches and medical staff. \u201cThis club\u2019s communication has been second to none,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot from Marcelo on WhatsApp telling us to stay safe.\u201d\nLeeds fans cannot wait to once more see Bielsa drinking coffee in Wetherby, posing for selfies in Morrisons and listening to music on his headphones as he makes the hour-long walk to Thorp Arch. For the moment though, they can rest assured he and his squad really are all about \u201cside before self\u201d.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/510c5b118ccad0428b24fe2ff50e66e0021023a0/0_4_5304_3185/master/5304.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da533d27678ea58f076a2e5160628519"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/the-russian-dolls-have-transformed-figure-skating-but-at-what-cost": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/the-russian-dolls-have-transformed-figure-skating-but-at-what-cost", "title": "The Russian Dolls have transformed figure skating.

Unintentionally, it may have shifted the landscape of women\u2019s figure skating in the process.\nBarring a minor miracle, three Russian teenagers would have battled it out for the podium places: 16-year-old Alena Kostornaia and a pair of 15-year-olds, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. The trio have revolutionized figure skating. They only made their senior debuts last year but blitzed through the sport, ensuring a multitude of headlines. In the Grand Prix final last December, Kostornaia claimed gold while Shcherbakova and Trusova rounded out the medals. They repeated the trick at the European championships the following month; their opponents left dumbstruck by their dominance.\nWhat makes them so good? Well, owing to their remarkable jumps, they maximize the technical points on offer. Trusova and Shcherbakova have both mastered skating\u2019s holy grail: the quad, an exhaustive element \u2013 and up until recently an unheard-of feat for ladies, which is four full rotations in the air.\nHowever, there are concerns. First, rather than a skating competition for women, are we now dealing with a jumping competition for girls? Second, and much more importantly, what\u2019s the cost of success \u2013 physically, emotionally and psychologically \u2013 for this collection of raw, developing children?\n\u201cThe worst aspect to this is that most of the time, in skating and gymnastics and maybe other sports, you grow up in a culture that\u2019s very authoritarian,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cYou grow up to believe if you get injured it\u2019s because you\u2019re weak. Or if your body or psychological state fails it\u2019s because you are weak. But why does the body of a teenager break?\n\u201cObviously, the athlete has responsibility but we never really question if there\u2019s something wrong with the coaching. Has there been a lot of over-training? I hear from doctors about 12-year-olds in America, Finland and Sweden \u2013 and I\u2019m sure in Russia it starts even earlier \u2013 coming to clinics with stress fractures and things which shouldn\u2019t happen at that age. It points to the fact the training has been too much. And how do they deal with that when they\u2019re so young?\u201d\nAll three Russian teenagers boast the same coach: Eteri Tutberidze, who has built a stable of female talent. She is a divisive figure, though not much is known about her \u2013 unusual for a skating community that can border on the incestuous. She made her name as a coach in 2014 when a 15-year-old girl in a red dress named Yulia Lipnitskaya cast a spell in Sochi and was crucial to Russia winning gold in the team event. She became a star. The following month, she finished second at the world championships but was quickly discarded as her body began to develop. By the end of 2016, she was done with the sport altogether. Drained and disillusioned, the following year she revealed a long-running battle with anorexia. \u201cI\u2019m no longer drawn to the ice,\u201d she said, damningly.\nBy that stage, Tutberidze had moved on and guided another prodigy, Evgenia Medvedeva, to back-to-back European and world titles. But at the 2018 Olympics, Medvedeva \n, 15-year-old Alina Zagitova, three years her junior. Tutberidze had a new favorite and within months, Medvedeva made a startling and unprecedented move. She left Russia altogether, deciding to continue her skating career in Canada. \u201cI feel more adult here,\u201d Medvedeva said later in 2018.\nAnd then there\u2019s Zagitova, the reigning Olympic and world champion. Still just 17, she announced in December that she was taking a break from skating for an indefinite period. The previous month, she had admitted finding it difficult to keep up with younger competitors, who she still trained alongside in Moscow. Most worryingly of all, she described how even attempting a quad jump was unrealistic for her until she got slimmer.\n\u201cQuads are too dangerous for me for the time being,\u201d she said. \u201cI will need to prepare for them physically and mentally. I will also need to lose some weight, something like 3kg, to decrease the risk of injuries.\u201d\nAnd this is a cornerstone of the debate surrounding the jumping phenomenon in women\u2019s skating and the rise of the so-called Russian Dolls: the female body.\nPuberty can vastly change how a skater performs. They grow taller, and heavier. It\u2019s expected. Most critically of all, it\u2019s natural. But in some skating quarters it\u2019s seen as an unwanted development and detrimental to skills such as the quad jump. Physical changes mean tweaking of techniques. And sometimes, coaches don\u2019t have the interest or patience. They\u2019ll merely find a younger skater to shape instead. Somebody who is prepubescent and weighs less. So, it\u2019s a genuine possibility that skaters on the edge of adolescence are buying into a fear and suspicion of puberty. And in a society where body image and the messaging surrounding it is such a hot topic, it seems skating has aligned itself with a deeply unsettling pattern.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cI was never educated on the effects of not getting your period. The expectation was that it was a good thing. Nobody was talking about the symptoms it can create, the psychological problems, the stress fractures that can happen due to the fact you don\u2019t get enough energy and your hormonal function not working. So we need to call out the community for sending these unhealthy messages. This notion you should always restrict your food and always lose weight and no matter what you must restrict, restrict. That kind of messaging is so concerning.\n\u201cI know many athletes who are emotionally and physically broken because the system doesn\u2019t care how much goes to waste as long as there are a few who make it. But what\u2019s worrying is that those who make it are only there for a few years and then they\u2019re broken too: they\u2019re \u2018too old\u2019 or can\u2019t sustain their careers.\u201d\nKorpi has a particular academic interest in the abuse of children and sees such behaviour as commonplace within skating circles.\n\u201cThere can be serious emotional abuse in training and coaching,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cMaybe skating is specifically vulnerable to child abuse because of the way the sport has developed and the way we value those crazy jumps and how it\u2019s easier to do them when you don\u2019t have an adult body yet. So the more robotic you can treat your mind and body the better. The coach is the one that holds the key to success. But if their coaching is emotionally abusive it can have very drastic consequences and has been compared a lot to the abuse between children and parents.\u201d\nSome say it\u2019s an overreaction. That skating has always produced exceptional, young talent. And it\u2019s worth mentioning that coaches such as Tutberidze are working within the ISU\u2019s age-limit rules. Ultimately, her job is to develop champions and she would certainly argue that everything else \u2013 regardless of the moral implications \u2013 is not a coach\u2019s concern.\n\u201cSkating has had child stars \u2013 Tara Lipinski, Michelle Kwan, Sarah Hughes \u2013 but they weren\u2019t pushed out of the sport because they couldn\u2019t keep up with the technical demands,\u201d Korpi says.\nBecause of the postponed world championships, the trio of Russian teenagers may not compete again competitively until the end of the year. By that stage, their bodies may have changed dramatically and Tutberidze may have moved on to her next project.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Eteri\u2019s child factory is the biggest problem in skating,\u201d Korpi says. \u201cThe problem is the sick culture that\u2019s been created. Eteri\u2019s factory is a symptom of this inhumane direction and culture our sport is taking. She\u2019s not the cause. There are many other coaches who work in a similar manner to her and many federations that support this kind of coaching.\u201d\nSo, it seems like skating has a decision to make: keep the facade in place or start to ask itself some tough questions.\n\u201cFor many people, it\u2019s not interesting anymore,\u201d says Korpi. \u201cPeople miss watching emotionally mature women skate instead of girls. It\u2019s almost \u2013 and I feel this too \u2013 difficult to watch some of these very, very young child stars. Because you can\u2019t help and think of what\u2019s behind that kind of performance and success.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17433da05f3b5bfe2c4a354d3cbb4722a042d371/254_66_1861_1117/master/1861.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8b38a228d85e8c77708ac17b16c8860"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/08/the-forgotten-story-of-the-pie-and-pints-match": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/08/the-forgotten-story-of-the-pie-and-pints-match", "title": "The forgotten story of ... the Pie and Pints match | Rob Smyth", "published": "Tue, 08 Nov 2016 12:00:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>In 1986 Northwich Victoria drew with Conference leaders Maidstone despite including three fans in their starting XI \u2013 one of whom had spent the afternoon in the pub</p><p>On 8 November 1986, Northwich Victoria drew 1-1 with Maidstone in the GM Vauxhall Conference.

That bald information does not suggest an urgent need for an anniversary article, but there was a little more to the story. Northwich were so short of players that their XI included three supporters, rounded up desperately in the hour before kick-off. One of them had already engaged in a different kind of warm-up: he\u2019d been in the pub.\nThis was not a bit of a laugh during a pre-season friendly, as when \n. It was a match against the league leaders. \u201cIt was a tremendous thing but it was a serious thing,\u201d said Derek Nuttall, the chairman of Northwich in 1986. \u201cThe club would have been censured if we hadn\u2019t put out a full team.\u201d\nIn the week before the game, the Northwich manager, Stuart Pearson, the former Manchester United and England forward, tried to get the game postponed because of injury and flu. \u201cAs it happened, the chairman of the league was Jim Thompson, and he was the chairman of Maidstone, so it would have been a bit of an embarrassment to him if the game had been called off,\u201d said Nuttall. \u201cThat made it more complicated. They wouldn\u2019t call it off.\u201d Pearson tried again on the Friday night, calling the league secretary. \u201cI think,\u201d said Nuttall, \u201cit was a fiery conversation.\u201d\nWhether in a fit of pique or as a more considered protest, Pearson planned to start the game with eight players. Nuttall did not find this out until 2pm, an hour before kick-off. \u201cThat would have been a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went into the social club, into the lounge area where they were all having a drink and a pie and so on, and said: \u2018Would anybody like a game of football?\u2019 They all looked at me like I was mad.\u201d\nNuttall explained that he was serious, and soon had three takers. \u201cOne of them had to go home for his boots. One had them in the boot of his car. And the other man was the boy who normally did the Tannoy. He fancied himself as a centre-forward, so he played up front.\u201d\nThe secretary, Ian Merrell, urgently faxed off the necessary paperwork \u2013 in those days you could register a player up to half an hour before kick-off \u2013 and the match went ahead. The three were Steve Garnett, Mark Fogg and Rick Parkin. One of them had already enjoyed two pints and a pork pie, the worst preparation for a professional match since \n.\n\u201cThe team played tremendously,\u201d said Nuttall. \u201cWe had Gordon Hill, the former Manchester United winger, playing for us. The instructions to the three new lads were: \u2018When you get the ball, give it to Gordon Hill.\u2019 He controlled the game. He was at the end of his career but he was a brilliant player, and a tremendous character \u2013 he used to do an excellent impression of Bruce Forsyth.\u201d\nGarnett, Fogg and Parkin did a decent impression of professional footballers. \u201cThey played OK,\u201d said Nuttall. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really have known that they weren\u2019t professionals. A couple of them had played amateur football. They were so happy to be playing for the team they support and they raised their game.\u201d\nThe match ended 1-1, and nobody was in any doubt who claimed the moral victory. \u201cIt was very embarrassing for Maidstone, and we were called before the league and had to explain the situation,\u201d said Nuttall. \u201cIt was called the Pie and Pints match. We had interest from all over the world, even New Zealand. It was so funny \u2013 funny but serious.\u201d It was even reported in the Los Angeles Times.\nThe Guardian spoke to Derek Nuttall on Tuesday 18 October. The following day, he died suddenly. He was 89 and had been involved with Northwich for 81 years \u2013 first as a fan, then board member, chairman and secretary. Mike Talbot-Butler, the former sports editor of the Northwich Guardian, described Nuttall\u2019s death as an \u201cincalculable loss \u2026 If ever there was a one-club man it was he and I dread to think what might have happened to The Vics without his foresight, leadership and example.\u201d\nNuttall had been fighting to save Northwich, \n: they have no ground and have suffered forced relegations, their former owner Jim Rushe was sent to prison this year for conspiring to supply cocaine, and in 2012 members of their supporters\u2019 trust broke away to form 1874 Northwich. \u201cWhatever the problems in 1986-87, they are nothing to what confronts them today,\u201d says Talbot-Butler. \u201cThere may be no NVFC in a year\u2019s time and they have been operating without a break since 1874. We veered off in separate directions a couple of seasons ago with the breakaway of 1874 Northwich FC, because it was felt the old club was being taken down the wrong path by successive owners. Yet Derek remained loyal to the end and never wavered in his belief that to keep NVFC going was paramount. I was proud that 1874 Northwich remembered Derek with a well-observed two minutes\u2019 silence before their FA Vase game against Billingham Synthonia.\u201d\nUntil he died, Nuttall was working to secure the club\u2019s future. \u201cThe best tribute to him would be the club\u2019s survival, which he had fought for over many years,\u201d \n. \u201cI hope the town of Northwich, and Vics fans everywhere, can show a level of support to keep them going. That could be as simple as going to a game and cheering them on when Saturday comes.\u201d\nIdeally with a pie in one hand and a pint in the other.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c73192c86f823cd7e8963f76d330e50f8afc71/0_286_5540_3326/master/5540.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75cb6b2f78f69501b90707f27992348e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2020/mar/25/super-league-challenge-cup-england-coronavirus-pandemic-rugby-league": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2020/mar/25/super-league-challenge-cup-england-coronavirus-pandemic-rugby-league", "title": "What next for the Super League, Challenge Cup and England fixtures?", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:04:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>The coronavirus pandemic could lead to a complete reboot of how rugby league is organised \u2013 starting next year<br></p><p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy\">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook\">No Helmets Required</a><br></p><p>When the time comes that rugby league can shape a fixture list for the rest of 2020, they will have to follow cricket\u2019s lead by prioritising the events that bring in the most money.

And that could lead to permanent changes to the game\u2019s structure.\nIn Super League\u2019s case, they need sufficient fixtures to satisfy Sky and play the Grand Final; for the RFL the essential revenue-generating events are the \n Final and England games \u2013 without that matchday income and broadcast fees, the governing body would face a cataclysmic scenario. No wonder they have already lodged a request for financial support from the government.\nSuper League has to be played to secure the TV revenue. For example, if life returns to whatever normal will be on 1 June, there will be 22 weekends until November. Given that some clubs have already played seven league games, a substantial season could still happen. And it needs to happen. With so many clubs reliant on the wealth of generous individual owners, whose businesses could be decimated by the pandemic, most are at serious risk. Hull FC lost more than \u00a3250,000 in 2019. What will they lose in 2020? All Super League clubs have already decided to introduce furloughing, mothballing operations during \n.\nAs long as Sky keep paying their stipend \u2013 just under \u00a3150,000 per Super League club per month \u2013 players and staff should get their money \u2013 eventually. But Sky will demand the content in exchange for their millions, even if it is spread out over the next couple of years. Giving them around 90 live games in 2020 is still possible: instead of the daft scenario of three or four clubs clashing with the TV game on Friday night, \n could spread five live TV matches from Thursday night to Sunday tea-time every week from June to November, a flatscreen smorgasbord for us league tragics.\nSome things will have to go. Magic Weekend at Newcastle seems highly unlikely to go ahead in late May, but it could be pushed back into the summer and used as part of a 22-round home-and-away fixture list, with the six \u201cloop\u201d fixtures abolished. Many clubs have played three of their loop fixtures already, Wakefield, Catalans and Hull just one. A wizard administrator could rearrange fixtures for the weekends when those clubs would now be free. For example, Castleford have already hosted Wigan, so would only need to play them once more, freeing up either round 16 or 25 to play one of the games missed during this break. St Helens would be free in rounds 13, 19 and 27.\nThe Challenge Cup offers problems and opportunities. Huddersfield are the only SL team knocked out, so the sixth round ties should be the first games played when sport returns. Three more top-flight clubs will go out, possibly more, enabling at least two league games to be played on quarter-final weekend. Alternatively, the next two rounds could be midweek affairs with weakened teams. With luck, flexible attitudes and good planning, between six and nine more Super League games could be played over the semi-final and final weekends, too.\nAnother couple of weeks could be shaved off the season by the Super League play-offs reverting to top four semi-finals, the winners heading straight to Old Trafford. With the NRL suspended, the Ashes is almost certain to be cancelled. That could allow Super League to run even later although the RFL will surely insist on securing some games for Shaun Wane\u2019s new England team. If the Super League is complete but the NRL is not, England could revitalise the European Championship.\nThis hiatus could actually help the Super League reshape the competition as they are rumoured to desire: a 14-team league, backed by a 16-team Championship, and the remaining clubs going into a newly aligned third tier. The suggestion of no relegation from the Super League 2020 would trigger the Championship to do the same, meaning the \n, and the Championship would go up to 15. Repeat that in 2021 and a 14-16 setup would be reached naturally in time for the new TV deal in 2022. What a turn-up!\nThe only losers would be League 1, where the likes of Newcastle, Barrow and Workington would have two years to get themselves out, Ottawa Aces just one, while New York City \u2013 like Ottawa, launched in a blaze of publicity just a few days before the whole show fell apart, would be left out, along with at least seven other League 1 clubs \u2013 that\u2019s if every club survives the pandemic.\nThe sport now has an opportunity to really consider if a national semi-professional third division, stretching from Newcastle to Llanelli, Workington to London, is a sensible thing. A new third tier could end the anachronistic divide between the amateur and professional game. The best National Conference League teams already challenge the weaker League 1 teams on the pitch and many are vastly stronger off it: many amateur clubs run dozens of teams, have hundreds of members, better facilities, bigger crowds and had flourishing income streams.\nThey also benefit from not spending more than \u00a3100,000 a year paying players and transporting them on ludicrous schleps around the country. Regionalised conferences with national play-offs seem a far better idea, perhaps playing from autumn to spring, leaving the summer to the pros again.\nWith Super League and the Championship potentially starting later in 2021, we could see a permanent shift to the shortened March to October season preferred by so many. Whatever happens, as \n: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of changes coming You\u2019ve best be payin\u2019 them some mind\u201d\nAnother major hurdle in shaping a new fixture list will be fitting in Catalans and Toronto: travel restrictions to and from France and Canada are unlikely to match those in the UK. Group training is banned in France until the middle of April at least, while non-Canadians cannot enter Canada and all flights are grounded until late May. Being based in Rochdale until spring breaks in Ontario could be a major bonus: the Wolfpack may have to play nearly all of their games in England. Given that the Dragons have only played four Super League games, they may struggle to get through their fixture list, whatever that ends up looking like.\nSome of our game\u2019s smallest clubs may actually benefit from being tadpoles among the tench. Those who only pay players when they play and do not have major outgoings, such as League 1 side Coventry Bears, could ride out the coronavirus storm better than expected.\n\u201cOur model is actually well prepared for this because we only pay players as they play,\u201d Coventry owner Alan Robinson told \n. \u201cAll our coaches are paid on a sessional basis and I\u2019m the only full-time employee. We only rent the facilities and if we don\u2019t use them we don\u2019t pay for them. We can just down our operation and open again when we need to. We run the club on a very lean basis. Some people think it\u2019s a miracle we survive, but I believe we\u2019re the most sustainable club in the whole of rugby league right now. If we weren\u2019t, we would cease to exist in the next few weeks.\u201d\nWhen Scotland Student international Hector McNeil arrived in London in the mid 1990s and couldn\u2019t find a team to play for, he just started one up. Having already been among the founding members of Scotland Rugby League, he was used to building something from scratch. Student Rugby League Old Boys launched in Hackney and changed their named to London Skolars in 1997 as part of a proposed sponsorship deal with Skol lager that fell through!\nThey worked their way from the London League to the National Conference to the semi-pro ranks in six whirlwind years, with McNeil moving from hooker to director to CEO. A successful asset manager in the City of London, McNeil brought his 25-year reign to an end on Monday, leaving the club along with octogenarian chairman Terry Browne, a similarly loyal servant. McNeil had been planning to withdraw for a while, but the hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic has hurried that decision. \n in London and the south, and the communities of Haringey and Enfield in particular \u2013 and in Ghana, where he has supported the game nascent roots \u2013 have an awful look to thank him for.\nWhile Italy remains in total lockdown with a horrific death toll, playing sport there seems a total irrelevance. The country is worst affected in the north-east, where many Italian rugby league players live and where most of the amateur clubs have been in recent years: Milan, Vicenza, Asti, Padova,Treviso, and their neighbours. Many Italy internationals are holed up now in those villages, towns and cities, unable to leave their homes other than to buy food. No Helmets will bring news from them soon. Meanwhile, our thoughts are with them.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19a256745c8c53160823d37cd10d52e8be1723a6/0_35_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb78571ccc0ed151bb48f405893e28dd"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fifa-suggests-player-contracts-and-transfer-windows-be-changed": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fifa-suggests-player-contracts-and-transfer-windows-be-changed", "title": "Fifa suggests player contracts and transfer windows be changed", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:15:53 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Internal document says contracts should end when season does</li><li>Fifa also urges clubs to find solutions to salary payments</li></ul><p>Current contracts for players and coaches should be extended until the end of the delayed domestic football seasons, according to an internal Fifa document presented to its Coronavirus Working Group.</p><p>The confidential document, seen by Reuters, also recommends allowing transfer windows to be changed in accordance with new season dates and urges clubs and players to work together to find solutions to salary payments during stoppages.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fifa-suggests-player-contracts-and-transfer-windows-be-changed\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Current contracts for players and coaches should be extended until the end of the delayed domestic football seasons, according to an internal \n document presented to its Coronavirus Working Group.\nThe confidential document, seen by Reuters, also recommends allowing transfer windows to be changed in accordance with new season dates and urges clubs and players to work together to find solutions to salary payments during stoppages.\nThe document is due to be discussed by members of Fifa\u2019s Working Group later on Thursday. No decision on the issues has yet been taken by, which set up the working group on 18 March and said in a statement that it will \u201cassess the need for amendments or temporary dispensations to the Fifa Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players\u201d to protect contracts for both players and clubs and adjusting player registration periods.\n\u201cThis work has already started and will be conducted in consultation with all key stakeholders, including confederations, member associations, clubs, leagues and players,\u201d Fifa added.\nMost domestic and international football competitions around the world have been suspended because of the pandemic and national team tournaments such as Euro 2020 and the Copa Am\u00e9rica have been postponed.\nWhile domestic leagues are hoping to resume when the threat from the virus has receded, concrete start dates have yet to be fixed. That leaves the issue of expiring player contracts, which are usually timed to finish at the end of a given season, as a potential headache.\nThe key suggestion to the working group in the document seen by Reuters is that \u201cwhere an agreement is due to expire at the original end date of a season, such expiry be extended until the new end date of the season\u201d.\nThe same approach would apply to deals for next season, with their start date delayed in accordance with the shifting calendar. The risk of some domestic divisions starting and finishing earlier or some national leagues having a different start date to other countries is also tackled in the document.\n\u201cIn case of overlapping seasons and/or registration periods, and unless all parties agree otherwise, priority be given to the former club to complete their season with their original squad, in order to safeguard the integrity of a domestic league championship\u201d.\nTransfer payments between clubs, scheduled around league start and end dates should also be delayed until the new start date of a season or its first registration period, the document states.\nThe working group will also examine the issue of clubs\u2019 responsibilities to pay their staff when leagues are suspended. The document states that clubs, players and coaches should be encouraged to work together to agree on salary reductions and deferrals.\nYet they should consider the alternative, where possible, that agreements between clubs and employees are suspended when teams are not playing or training. It is also recommended that Fifa uses its newly-created \u2018Fund for Professional Players\u2019 to help ease any difficulties that clubs are facing.\nTransfer windows, fixed around the end and start of the seasons, will also need to be adjusted to fit in with altered season dates and the document suggests such changes should be allowed, so long as they do not exceed the maximum 16-week period.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c996fd4b2fe4d806643885722f14f4a49ea6fd/16_0_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=283c7bf1a31bd99002e2fca484940bed"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/englische-woche/2020/mar/26/raul-bundesliga-football-fans-schalke-real-madrid": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/englische-woche/2020/mar/26/raul-bundesliga-football-fans-schalke-real-madrid", "title": "When Ra\u00fal moved to the Bundesliga and charmed a nation of football fans", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 11:59:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>Ra\u00fal was 33 when he left Real Madrid for Schalke but he had not lost his competitive streak or his goalscoring touch</p><p>By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/englische_woche\">Jason Humphreys</a> for <a href=\"http://englischewoche.com/writing/\">Englische Woche</a><br></p><p>In the closing minutes of Schalke\u2019s pre-season friendly against Qatari club Al Sadd, a 13-year-old boy held up the fourth official\u2019s board.

The crowd duly obliged and the name \u201cRauuuul\u201d rung around the ground. The 36-year-old left the field, saluted the crowd and embraced the young boy on the sideline \u2013 his eldest son, Jorge.\nThis was Ra\u00fal\u2019s last game for \n, played against the team he had agreed to join next. He played a half for each team, scoring two goals against his new employers in the process. This was his final farewell to a club that had taken him to their hearts, and one that had found a place in his.\nThe match against Al Sadd was watched by a capacity crowd of 60,000 \u2013 unheard of for a friendly. Schalke could have sold out the stadium almost two times over. More than 100,000 fans inquired about tickets, leaving many disappointed. To compensate, the club erected large screens around the ground, creating a unique atmosphere for the occasion.\nFelix Magath had caught many off-guard when he signed Ra\u00fal \u2013 then the record goalscorer in the Champions League \u2013 to Schalke in 2010. Even though Ra\u00fal was in the twilight of his career, persuading him to leave Madrid for the industrial heartland of Germany was still something of a coup. Ra\u00fal reportedly turned down lucrative moves to Russia, Qatar and the US, citing Schalke\u2019s involvement in the \n as a deciding factor \u2013 a sign that his competitive ambition had not abated.\nRa\u00fal\u2019s first game for Schalke came against Louis van Gaal\u2019s defending champions, Bayern Munich, in a pre-season tournament. The entire German football-watching public was excited to see him step out for the \n, yet there were also lingering doubts. How would he adapt to a new league and footballing culture? Was he a spent force? Despite being a club legend at \n, Ra\u00fal had been slowly nudged to the periphery.\nThe doubts disappeared quickly. He scored his first goal in the 25th minute, pouncing on a rebound to prod in from close range. He had not lost an ounce of his poacher\u2019s instinct. It was a dream start but what followed nine minutes later was something \n. Ra\u00fal ghosted away from his marker to pick up a short pass 25 yards from goal. He controlled the ball, took another touch to evade three Bayern defenders and then he lifted the ball over the goalkeeper, whose despairing dive made the goal look even sweeter.\nRa\u00fal had not needed to look up before he shot; he had already sized up the situation before the pass came. His run made the pass, which in turn made the chance. He had seen it all before it had happened. He knew the keeper had strayed too far forward and would not have time to get back on his line. Those three touches on his left foot had taken out the entire Bayern backline.\nRa\u00fal had arrived in Germany. It was to be the beginning of a love story. Despite starting with a bang against Bayern, he did not set the \n alight from the offset. His team struggled early on \u2013 winning just one of his first 10 games \u2013 and it took Ra\u00fal until late September to get off the mark. However, once he scored that first goal, he never looked back. A brace against St Pauli was followed by two hat-tricks before the winter break.\nRa\u00fal had been paired with fellow new recruit Klaas Jan Huntelaar up front, yet Schalke continued to underperform and Magath was relieved of his duties in March. The team finished the season 14th in the table, six points above the relegation zone, after picking up just one point from their last five league games.\nDespite their blundering in the Bundesliga\n Schalke found solace in the cup competitions. Ra\u00fal helped the club reach their first ever Champions League semi-final, scoring five goals in the competition before their run came to an abrupt end against defending champions Manchester United.\nIn the DFB Pokal, however, Ra\u00fal and his team went one step further. The iconic No 7 made the difference in the semi-final, scoring the only goal in a narrow win over Bayern Munich, setting up a final against Duisburg from the second division. Schalke had decent pedigree in the cup, but they had not reached the final since 2005 and had not lifted the trophy for almost a decade. Incidentally, for all his honours in Spain and Europe, Ra\u00fal had never won a domestic cup. That changed at Olympiastadion. Schalke controlled the match from the beginning and \n.\nRa\u00fal\u2019s second and final season with Schalke began with the Supercup, the traditional pre-season game between the league and cup holders. Across town, J\u00fcrgen Klopp had started something special with Schalke\u2019s arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund, winning the league for the first time in nine years. However, it was the \n who triumphed in the Supercup, \n.\nDespite losing their coach Ralf Rangnick early in the season, Schalke had become a better team than the season before, establishing themselves in the top four. As for Ra\u00fal, he continued to do what he did best \u2013 scoring and making goals. He had become an influential member of the squad so, when Benedikt H\u00f6wedes missed a game through injury, Ra\u00fal was given the captain\u2019s armband. He scored one goal and made another in a 4-0 win.\nThe goals continued throughout the winter. He hit a hat-trick Werder Bremen in the league; he scored his 400th career goal in February; and he scored his 77th \u2013 and final \u2013 goal in European competition against Athletic Bilbao in the\nEuropa League. However, on 19 April, Ra\u00fal announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season. Schalke reportedly offered him \u20ac4m to stay for another year, but he had made up his mind. His career in Europe was over.\nRa\u00fal\u2019s last match for Schalke was a comprehensive 4-0 win over Hertha Berlin. Needless to say, he scored in that game too. After the final whistle blew, he walked around the pitch with his children, applauding the fans and wiping tears from his eyes. There was a real sense that the curtain was coming down on something special. Ra\u00fal was finally getting the send-off he deserved \u2013 albeit from Schalke fans in Gelsenkirchen rather than Real fans in Madrid.\nHe was only in Germany for two seasons but his impact on Schalke \u2013 and the Bundesliga as a whole \u2013 cannot be underestimated. Aside from his obvious talent, his commitment, professionalism and behaviour were an example to all. He understood and embraced the fiercely passionate fans in a part of Germany noted for its love of the game. His class and humility won admirers throughout the country, while his qualities on the pitch sprinkled a touch of glamour on the league.\nFrom his first match on, Ra\u00fal showed he could not only score goals, but score beautiful goals. He won the \n award four times and the \n in 2011 and 2013, the latter in tandem with Julian Draxler. All in all, he scored 40 times in 98 appearances, including 28 league goals in 66 matches.\nOn the pitch after the Hertha Berlin game, Ra\u00fal was awarded a framed No 7 shirt, signed by all of his teammates. As a sign of respect, the shirt was retired \u2013 and although it is now back in rotation, the man who wore it for those two seasons will never be replaced.\n", "pic":

It would also apply to staff working with those teams.\nBarcelona are the only \n club to admit they are looking at ways to alleviate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, although the league announced it would support its members in any measures they deem necessary. More clubs are expected to follow suit.\nLabour legislation in Spain allows companies to apply temporary measures to lay off staff or reduce wages in exceptional circumstances but Barcelona would prefer to reach a negotiated settlement. Staff in non-football departments are resigned to the probability they will be affected.\nThe TV company that owns the rights to La Liga in Spain has announced it will apply temporary measures to more than 1,000 staff.\nBarcelona held remote meetings late last week and again on Tuesday. They had a positive response from the club captains. The proposal was for the reduction to last as long as the lockdown after which players would go back to earning 100% of their salary, even if competition does not return and the league remains unfinished. Spain\u2019s state of alarm was announced on 11 March and is set to continue until at least 11 April.\nMost Spanish football players earn a monthly salary, referred to as the \n, plus two larger annual payments six months apart known as the \n. It is not clear whether the reduction would apply only to the \n or to the \n as well. Four monthly payments remain outstanding this season.\nBarcelona\u2019s economic situation is precarious and there are concerns the club may not be able to meet some of their payments if the season is not completed. Of an annual budget of \u20ac1.047bn (\u00a3970m), 66% was spent on wages last season, down from 70% the season before but considered too high. The projection was 61% this season but that target is now unlikely to be met.\nMeanwhile the English Football League is working with the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association to determine a solution to financial matters, notably player wages. An outcome is being sought that will ease clubs through the coming months, with football suspended until at least 30 April.\nLeeds are among several Championship clubs to have held discussions with players about deferring wages. The Leeds director of football, Victor Orta, and the chief executive, Angus Kinnear, discussed it with players on Tuesday and, in the event such a measure is enforced, it is understood the wages of the manager, Marcelo Bielsa, and his backroom staff would also be deferred. Leeds have five remaining home fixtures, each of which earns around \u00a3700,000 in matchday revenue.\nIt is understood discussions with the PFA stemmed from a conference call between Championship clubs last week when they talked about potential strategies for lessening the strain of player wages on finances at a time when there is little to no income.\nSome clubs operate with significantly higher wage bills than others and, for some, the short-term financial hole created by the absence of matchday revenue is bearable. Birmingham have requested their players who earn more than \u00a36,000 a week \n, and many other second-tier clubs are believed to exploring similar solutions.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d669b20d624957c41e7cca8c5c825082026f62f/0_78_3899_2339/master/3899.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b439af06ca6582de3984d9c86817bf2"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/awards-of-the-premier-league-season-so-far-sadio-mane-danny-ings": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/awards-of-the-premier-league-season-so-far-sadio-mane-danny-ings", "title": "From Man\u00e9 to Ings: awards of the Premier League season so far", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>With football on hold we select some of the highlights of the top-flight campaign until now \u2013 and the biggest flop</p><p>Jordan Henderson\u2019s influence deserves acclaim but Sadio Man\u00e9 is remarkably consistent and reaches heights that his captain cannot.

Having the athleticism and skill to play as he does is rare; having the presence of mind to use those gifts with such effectively and selflessly is rarer still.\nAlthough he was only 23 when the season started, lots of people had abandoned hope of this Spaniard becoming a reliable presence in the \n. But now he is its most thrilling player, getting viewers out of their seats as often as he puts opponents on their backsides. His improvement has been a joy to watch. He used to be accused of being rash with his crosses and tactically clueless, but now he is a regular supplier of clever passes and goals and can torment opponents from any of the three positions in which Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has played him this season. From being a player who looked to be going nowhere extremely fast, he has matured into an unstoppable force.\nKevin De Bruyne wields his right foot like a mean judge wields his gavel \u2013 when he draws it back, you know a pitiless sentence is about to be imposed. The Belgian was never likely to be lenient when a headed clearance fell towards him at the edge of Newcastle\u2019s area in November and, sure enough, he chested it down and leapt to lash the bouncing ball into the net via the underside of the bar with a strike so pure it felt like justice even though \n had not put up much of a case for their title defence before that.\nWithout diminishing J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s inspirational work at Anfield, it is fair to say that no manager has surpassed expectations this season as much as Wilder, whose team were almost universally tipped to stay stuck to the bottom of the table like a schoolboy\u2019s chewing gum. Instead \n are challenging for European qualification, teaching a lesson to everyone who dismissed them before the start of the campaign. Even opponents who have studied them closely have struggled to find a way of disrupting a slick, remorseless and inventive team filled mostly with players who had previously failed to make the grade at this level. Top marks.\nBruno Fernandes looks set to become a hero for Manchester United but has played only five league matches since arriving at the club in January. Wolves\u2019 Pedro Neto and Watford\u2019s Isma\u00efla Sarr are exciting youngsters who have been spectacular in patches and can be expected to make even bigger splashes next season, as can Allan Saint-Maximin at Newcastle. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez has proved to be one of the best strikers in the world at Wolves but it took no great insight to know that would be the case, since he had thrived there on loan before making his deal permanent last summer. Danny Ings, by contrast, was beset by injuries after joining \n on loan in 2018 so there was a degree of risk in spending nearly \u00a320m to tie him to the club last summer. But the striker has proven to be an excellent acquisition, scoring 43% of his team\u2019s league goals and orchestrating their attacks.\nLast season Spurs were Champions League finalists, had a beautiful new stadium and one of the brightest managers around. Less than a year later they are out of realistic contention for European qualification, have jilted Mauricio Pochettino and most of the people in their lovely home seem unhappy, including their new manager, who, among other woes, seems to be struggling to figure out how to inspire the club\u2019s record signing, Tanguy Ndombele. It has been unseemly dwindling by anyone\u2019s standards. Except maybe Danny Drinkwater\u2019s.\nIt was a Friday night under the Molineux floodlights and you could have got drunk on the atmosphere alone. But that was no excuse for Ederson, who got himself sent off after 12 minutes for clattering into Diogo Jota outside the area. At the other end Rui Patr\u00edcio saved Raheem Sterling\u2019s penalty \u2013 twice, owing to intervention by VAR \u2013 but could not stop the forward from putting City in front from the rebound. In a contest of exhilarating intensity and rarefied quality Sterling put City 2-0 up with a cute dink. Then Wolves, for whom Traor\u00e9 was phenomenal, came storming back, with Matt Doherty plundering a rousing victory in the 89\n minute and effectively ending City\u2019s title defence.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8afb36fc7a92804b3aea47d4149699748e28e2/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36d429227381d54559c754f761986614"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/which-teams-have-played-in-front-of-fake-fans-or-pumped-in-atmosphere": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/which-teams-have-played-in-front-of-fake-fans-or-pumped-in-atmosphere", "title": "Which teams have played in front of fake fans or pumped-in atmosphere? | The Knowledge", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 10:00:55 GMT", "summary": "<p>Plus: prolific single-season penalty scorers, unusual ways to decide a tournament and more</p><ul><li><a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">Mail us</a> your questions or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">@TheKnowledge_GU</a></li></ul><p><strong>\u201cWith the increase in games with no spectators because of the coronavirus outbreak, have there been instances in the past of teams using loudspeakers, cardboard cutouts of fans, or similar effects to try and replicate the atmosphere of a full stadium?\u201d</strong> wonders Christopher Sato.</p><p>\u201cSadly, my lot (Boro) tried this during Steve McClaren\u2019s race to try to pep up the atmosphere for our Uefa Cup run,\u201d writes Garry Brogden. \u201cThey put out a casting call for people to go down and record a few chants one day \u2013 about 12 people turned up, including an acquaintance from a Middlesbrough online forum.

There was laughter round the ground. A few minutes later, the Gregorian monks started again, \u2018Come on Boro\u2019. This time there was laughter and a few obscenities flying. After one more go, with about the same reaction, the experiment was binned. We came back to win in one of the greatest Boro nights ever. I wonder whether they still have the tapes?\u201d\nA number of readers flagged up the \u2018Highbury Mural\u2019, painted to hide construction works on the North Bank in 1992. \u201cIt caused a lot of controversy,\u201d writes Elliot Leaver. \u201cThe underrepresentation of people of colour and women was pointed out and children\u2019s charities were not happy that kids were next to people who didn\u2019t appear to be their parents. It was repainted several times to make it more diverse, including the addition of four nuns in the top left hand corner; one was hit in the face by a Lee Dixon clearance.\u201d\nSteve Bould didn\u2019t get far enough forward to take aim at a nun but he did speak in 2006 about the experience. \u201cThe mural at that end was weird: all those silent, painted faces staring at you,\u201d he remembered. \u201cFirst game with it there, we led Norwich 2-0 and lost 3-2, which summed up how it felt to play in front of it.\u201d\nThe mural season was a disastrous one for the Gunners. When a parachutist almost crashed into the wooden construction on the opening day of the Premier League season it set the tone. They limped to 10th place.\nArsenal were involved in another attempt to replicate a lack of atmosphere. The 2019 Europa League final with Chelsea in Baku was a farce that only around 12,000 genuine Arsenal and Chelsea fans could attend. Amy Lawrence stumbled upon organisers testing out speakers intended to add atmosphere to a match that was largely attended by bemused locals who were bussed in and were about as active and noisy as the painted faces on the North Bank in 1992.\nIn 2010 Serie B side Triestina came up with a creative way to deal with their disappointing crowds. Struggling to get anywhere near the Stadio Nereo Rocco\u2019s capacity of 32,454, owners took the decision to close an entire stand along one side of the pitch. To avoid having rows of empty seats on display on the rare occasions they appeared on TV, the seats were covered with giant vinyl posters of fake fans, making it look like a crowd from an old computer game. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have a full stadium with real supporters and we\u2019ve done everything we can to get people through the gates, but the reality is that we can\u2019t,\u201d said colourful owner, Maurizio Zamperini. \u201cThis way at least we create a bit of atmosphere, a bit of theatre.\u201d\n writes Bas Vlaming. \nThey certainly have, Bas. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to mention the English record holder Franny Lee,\u201d suggests Navin Patel. \u201cLee scored 15 penalties for Manchester City in the 1971-72 season. He \u2018earned\u2019 many of those penalties himself, but there have been suggestions that many of them wouldn\u2019t stand up to current VAR scrutiny. City could do with such a successful penalty taker these days, given that they seem to be pretty useless in that department at the moment, but perhaps even more useful in our current predicament would be his ability to make toilet rolls, a business that made him a millionaire.\u201d\nIndeed it did. He was in the paper-recycling business and toilet rolls were made in a factory he owned on Parrott Street in his hometown, Bolton. \u201cWhen I finished at Derby the company had between 80-100 employees in 1978,\u201d Lee said in 2015.\n writes Andrew Burrows. \nPaul Nash winds the clock back to early in the 1992-93 season and the curiosity that was the Anglo-Italian Cup. \u201cBristol Rovers lost to West Ham on a referee\u2019s coin toss!\u201d yelps Paul. \u201cThey had finished the English group stage on the same points and same goal difference. Rovers were a heads away from a European tournament with some relatively big names \u2013 Reggiana and Pisa (who had David Platt playing for them the season before) \u2013 and it was made even worse that neighbours Bristol City qualified. Everyone I\u2019ve told in the intervening 30 years doesn\u2019t seem to grasp the magnitude of it.\u201d\n asked Peregrine Roscorla in March 2006.\nWe haven\u2019t been able to find anything more miserable than that, Peregrine, but were amused to find that Europe\u2019s least appealing club competition may well be the InterToto Cup. The 2003 first-round clash between Olympiakos Nicosia and ZTS Dubnica (Slovakia) attracted an impressive 71 punters, while a far more respectable 80 turned up two years later as Olympiakos Nicosia hosted Gloria Bistrita (Romania), again in the first round. On the international front, the record low for Uefa competitions remains the Euro 96 qualifier between Azerbaijan and Poland in Trabzon (Turkey), when precisely 200 hardy souls went out of their way to watch a 0-0 draw.\n\u201cMarlon Pickett made his AFL debut for Richmond against Greater Western Sydney in the 2019 Grand Final before a crowd of 100,014. His second career game this weekend, against Carlton, was played in an empty stadium due to the coronavirus outbreak. What is the greatest differential in crowd size for a footballer playing in consecutive matches?\u201d asks Graham Clayton.\n\u201cWhat is the latest in a season that a team has won a league title?\u201d asks Richard Smith.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba9bd05ef2f72c309fda80ab9a6014b8334297d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41c69d5ca6733a27d5763ca287b13063"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2020/mar/25/footballers-already-agreed-switch-clubs-summer-transfer-window": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2020/mar/25/footballers-already-agreed-switch-clubs-summer-transfer-window", "title": "The footballers who have already agreed to switch clubs this summer", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 17:30:46 GMT", "summary": "<p>Chelsea, Barcelona, Ajax, Benfica and Bayern Munich are all expecting to welcome new players onboard this summer<br></p><p>By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlaurence7\">Martin Laurence</a> for <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\">WhoScored</a></p><p>With football quite rightly postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic, there is so much up in the air.

Leagues will need to be restructured drastically when the 2019-20 season resumes. There is also the issue of expiring contracts, with clubs potentially offering short-term extensions to players who would otherwise leave before the season concludes. Some players have already signed pre-contract deals with other clubs and are due to make their moves in June.\nWhatever happens, with so much uncertainty over the summer transfer window, those teams who had secured new signatures in preparation for the next campaign will be pleased to have done so. Here are five notable signings and the roles they will play for their new clubs when football eventually returns.\nHakim Ziyech is perhaps the most significant signing to be wrapped up before the transfer window opens. \n fans will be eagerly anticipating the first sight of Ziyech in blue. The Moroccan has been a star turn for Ajax in the Eredivisie for years now, earning our highest rating in each of the last four seasons.\nThe question has been why it has taken so long for a top club in Europe\u2019s elite leagues to sign the playmaker, now 27. Chelsea have finally taken the plunge and they can expect moments of real brilliance from Ziyech. He is comparable to Bruno Fernandes in many ways. He is extremely confident in the final third, although he does not score that many goals given the number of shots he attempts. However, there is no denying his technical ability. He has registered double figures for assists in the last six league seasons. His ability to play at No 8, No 10 or from wide will be a huge asset to Frank Lampard.\nMany will not have witnessed Trinc\u00e3o at his twinkle-toed best, but rest assured \n have signed a real gem. The slight winger is only 20 and has only been on the pitch for 1,064 minutes this season for Braga \u2013 in the Primeira Liga and Europa League \u2013 but he has had a direct hand in 12 goals. That\u2019s one every 89 minutes on average, having scored seven and set up five more.\nThe Portugal Under-21 international predominantly plays from Lionel Messi\u2019s favoured right flank, but he has been deployed in a more central role this season and impressed. Averages of 3.3 shots, 2.5 key passes and four dribbles per 90 minutes are pretty exceptional. Trinc\u00e3o will give Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann \u2013 both of whom have underwhelmed at Camp Nou for different reasons \u2013 some food for thought.\nAjax\u2019s ability to make a lot of money on their prized assets while replacing them with cheaper alternatives has been impressive of late and they will be hoping for another success story when Antony arrives from S\u00e3o Paulo. The 20-year-old Brazilian has the unenviable task of stepping into Ziyech\u2019s boots.\nLike the Moroccan he played from the right wing in the Brasileirao last season and certainly caught the eye, earning our second highest rating (7.14) for players aged 21 and under. Despite his youth, Antony was a mainstay for S\u00e3o Paulo. He had a direct hand in 10 goals, scoring four and setting up six. He is similar to Ziyech in the sense that he takes a lot of shots for a modest goal return. He also has superb trickery, (completing 2.6 dribbles per 90 minutes).\nOnly one player aged 21 or under had a higher rating than Antony in the Brazilian top flight last season and that was his fellow winger Pedrinho (7.24), who has made the move from Corinthians to \n. The 21-year-old also plays from the right and is in a similar mould to the Ajax-bound winger. He has scored a modest five goals from 28 appearances, setting up another four.\nAnother strong dribbler, Pedrinho is a real creator from wide areas too, having set up 50 chances from open play in 2019 \u2013 only five players managed more in the Brasileiro. It will be interesting to see where he fits in at Benfica. Their star player, Pizzi, has operated from the right this season but he could move into the central playmaker role \u2013 as could Pedrinho for that matter \u2013 currently occupied by Adel Taarabt.\nAlexander N\u00fcbel is being talked up as the new Manuel Neuer and he has followed in the Germany goalkeeper\u2019s footsteps by making the move from Schalke to \n on a free transfer. N\u00fcbel captained Schalke this season before losing his place amid the speculation of his defection to Munich. Schalke have played five games without him in goal, winning just one of them.\nThe 23-year-old may be expected to fill in as Neuer\u2019s backup at Bayern but he is a colossal figure between the posts and will have other ideas. After all, since Neuer returned from a serious injury last season, he has been far from his imperious best. He has improved this season after a pretty dismal 2018-19 campaign, but Neuer will need to be sharp once N\u00fcbel arrives. The new kid on the block will be waiting for another slip-up.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ff25e68e4a00b0f75f402f9ecd2c800527a308/11_7_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=046d3d430e3bcb8cd4861a882761579f"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/football-quiz-stadiums-of-yore": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/football-quiz-stadiums-of-yore", "title": "Football quiz: stadiums of yore", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 13:18:30 GMT", "summary": "<p>Who flew The Nest?

Maybe that\u2019s because Football People, usually so easy to hold up and lampoon, are showing their capacity to do very nice things.\nWhere better place to start than Ashley Young, the world leader we never knew we needed. \u201cJust wanted to share my thoughts given I\u2019m currently in Italy, the epicentre of the virus,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday night, and how refreshingly cogent those thoughts were. If you thought footballers never set foot in Sainsbury\u2019s, Waitrose or their Italian equivalents then think again: Young\u2019s insights into shopping etiquette in the time of Covid-19, and plenty more besides, were genuinely useful and well-informed. It\u2019s probably time to get him a move to Major League Soccer for the final five years of his career and naturalise him to run for president.\nElsewhere, \n. \u201cOur proximity as a football club next door to a hospital puts us in a unique position to offer help,\u201d explained Watford chief suit Scott Duxbury. Vicarage Road could be used for training, inductions, childcare facilities and warehouse space; and there we were thinking Isma\u00efla Sarr\u2019s brace against Liverpool was going to be the most heroic act carried out there this season.\nWatching the football is not exactly a priority for NHS staff at the moment but Brighton are leading an initiative to offer them 1,000 tickets whenever things do get back under way. They\u2019ve suggested an approach whereby clubs nominate one another to do the same; it could be the kind of drinking game too much self-isolation might cook up but in reality it\u2019s just a lovely idea for some of the most deserving people in society.\nCommunity initiatives such as those devised by Arsenal, whose many pledges include using club cars and staff volunteers to help frontline NHS staff, are legion from top to bottom. The game\u2019s heaviest hitters are chipping in too. \n towards efforts to combat the terrible coronavirus situation in Spain, while stories are emerging of various players and squads agreeing to defer or even forego their wages.\nNo amount of help can be too much and, of course, many \u2013 but far from all \u2013 of those in the football industry are exceptionally privileged. We\u2019ll take another pop at them again, don\u2019t know where, don\u2019t know when. But for today we\u2019ll skulk back under the covers with the comforting thought that there are some pretty good eggs in football after all.\n\u201cHe could get emotional and was crying sometimes, when he was speaking about important matters.

Yup, I\u2019m now a Dockers fan just because of a truck trip\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner (in the USA! USA!!

Carew, a second-change off-spinner who would be lucky to get on most Saturdays in league cricket, was allowed to bowl 13 overs, of which 12 were maidens, for one run and one wicket. The leg-breaks of Rodriguez were a distant approximation of that mystic art which Wright or O\u2019Reilly would have disdained to own, so high was the proportion of full tosses and long hops and even no-balls. From 35 overs, 35 runs were struck.\u201d\nTwo days later: \u201cEngland defeated the West Indies in the fourth Test today in one of the most stirring finishes ever to thrill a cricket crowd.\u201d\nIn between: the declaration, an act of cricketing alchemy that turned what was ghastly into gold.\nWest Indies were 92 for two, 215 runs ahead with a draw apparently guaranteed, when Garry Sobers called them in, giving England 53 overs to knock off the required runs. This was, to be fair, an England team that rarely scored anything but slugglishly, and had almost capitulated when Sobers \n, but this time they clicked into gear. The finish line was crossed \n, and Sobers took the blame. That night an effigy of the West Indies captain was hanged and burned in Port of Spain, and his reputation never recovered. \u201cThat declaration and result followed me for the remainder of my career,\u201d he grumbled.\nMuch of the most interesting moments in that series happened, like the declaration, off the field of play. During the fifth day of the second Test a riot erupted in protest at Basil Butcher\u2019s dismissal, leading to an 80-minute delay and the plentiful if imprecise use of tear gas. \u201cThe police threw their gas bombs straight in the path of the prevailing north-east winds,\u201d Alan Ross wrote in the Observer. \u201cAs a result, those whom they wished to flush out escaped almost scot-free while the players, the TV cameramen, the cowering members and their friends in the pavilion were obliged to undergo the mild equivalent of a Somme gas attack. Tear gas is a very unpleasant business, scorching both eyes and lungs, and I don\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\nAfter that game, like the first, was drawn England moved to Barbados, where during preparations for the third Test the vice-captain and best all-rounder, Fred Titmus, lost four toes in a swimming accident. \u201cTwo were cut off by the propeller of a small speedboat around which Titmus and several teammates were cavorting as carefree as dolphins near the shore,\u201d the Guardian reported, \u201cand two others had to be amputated.\u201d Astonishingly Titmus returned to action within two months but would play only four more Tests, and none for six and a half years.\nAnd then the declaration, which prompted the only positive result in a series that otherwise featured four draws.\nThat this series is seen as some kind of nadir for Sobers is puzzling. He scored more runs than anyone else on either side, averaging 90.83; only the spinner Lance Gibbs bowled more than his 232.5 overs; and among the West Indies players he ranked No 2 for wickets and No 1 for catches. Also confusing is the divergence between his extremely negative view of the series, and other observers\u2019 more positive spins.\n\u201cThat series was so boring,\u201d Sobers wrote. \u201cEngland were bowling something like 12 or 13 overs an hour operating with two spinners for much of the time and eight men on the offside, bowling on the off stump. I got so sick of it. I was so fed up. I was there to play cricket and this wasn\u2019t what I thought of as cricket.\u201d The former England player Reg Simpson said England\u2019s slow over-rate was \u201cnegative and dull, and the sort of thing that is killing cricket\u201d, adding: \u201cI applaud Sobers all the way and am quite disgusted at England\u2019s bowling only 22 overs in two hours. There was no justification for it and people have a right to be incensed by it.\u201d\nMeanwhile in the Guardian, Bruce Barber gushed of the series that \u201cBarbados in the third Test afforded respite from almost unbearable thrills\u201d. In the Observer, Ross was equally effusive: \u201cFour thrillers out of five is something no one can complain about, though most of the Tests took a long time to get under way, keeping up a predictable steady rhythm until the weekend and then, on the verge of drifting into stalemate, accelerating into high drama. \n as a spectacle in the West Indies tends to be disappointing but each match, often surprisingly, acquired a dramatic intensity of its own and the series as a whole was an astonishing one.\u201d\nWithout the Sobers declaration, none of those words would have been written. It was a gamble that lost his side the Test and the series, and himself a reputation, but it also turned the mundane into the memorable, and as such was surely a noble act of self-sacrifice in the causes of sport and entertainment. \u201cI wanted to make a game of it rather than letting the game die,\u201d Sobers said. \u201cWhen things pay off you are great and when they don\u2019t you are a darn idiot.\u201d The truth is that this one \npay off, and handsomely.

Dupont is not a typical French scrum-half in that he prefers to run and probe rather than box-kick, \n, against a defence that stopped powerful ball-carriers behind the gainline, he struggled to make an impact, but at 23 can put it down to experience. The flanker Charles Ollivon has been almost as influential, growing as a player having been made captain, while for England Maro Itoje stood out after the \n, backed up by Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry with Ellis Genge providing cameos from the bench. The Scotland prop Rory Sutherland has anchored a previously troublesome set-piece and Jordan Larmour has had his moments for Ireland.\nSutherland can be counted as one: his only previous appearance in the championship was in 2016 when he came off the bench for 14 minutes against Ireland. A first start followed in Japan, but then a serious injury threatened to end his career. \n has made an impact with Wales after surprising most of the rugby world before the tournament by revealing he was qualified to play for the land of his grandmother. He has endured some testing moments, targeted defensively in Dublin and conceding an \n, but he has revelled in the more open approach under Wayne Pivac, able to step out of contact and make the ball available, deceptively strong and the catalyst for a side trying to make the crossing from the past to the present. France\u2019s full-back Anthony Bouthier was playing second-division rugby a year ago, but even in Scotland showed his attacking threat.\nIt would have been Galthi\u00e9 before the last round but France struggled to find a solution to Scotland stopping their attacks at source and lost their discipline. A new, young side need time and there was ample evidence over the first three weekends that the fickle, careless side who since 2010 have left only a faint footprint on the Six Nations, is a serious contender again. Their first-half display against England was impressive in defence and attack, while their victory in Cardiff showed they had found the means to win a big match on the road.\nIf England look the favourites if the tournament resumes, it has been a weird couple of months for Eddie Jones, who made a series of headline-grabbing remarks that reflected poorly on someone normally so sure-footed with the media. That the Rugby Football Union had to be nudged into making a response to \n, who refereed the victory over Wales, which contained an ill-disguised implication of bias, reflected badly on a governing body that has become rudderless and offers no leadership at a time when the game is desperate for some.\nScotland\u2019s defence has been a highlight of the tournament, four tries conceded by a team who had averaged nearly 14 against in a campaign in the past six tournaments and 12.5 since it started in 2000. It is overseen by \n, who was sacked as the Ospreys coach in 2018 and spent a year with the Waratahs before arriving in Scotland. Shades of Shaun Edwards in his approach.\nJonny May\u2019s second in Paris, Romain Ntamack\u2019s solo effort against France, the off-loading that led to Tomos Williams crossing the line \n and Stuart Hogg finding \n were notable, but Wales\u2019s counterattack at the start of the second half against England, sparked by Tompkins and finished by \nwas exceptional.\nItaly continue to struggle, failing to score a point in two of their three matches, the absence of Finn Russell meant the loss of one of the sport\u2019s remaining mavericks, although Scotland found an inner resolve, and Jones\u2019s remarks about O\u2019Keeffe were below the belt, but four years after the Six Nations failed to act \n, the tournament\u2019s disciplinary system remains slow at times to respond.\nIt did nothing about Jones\u2019s remarks and, after the match officials failed to spot Marler tweaking Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s privates, used a sledgehammer to crack a nut, as it were, by charging the prop with a serious act of foul play \n when a misconduct rap and a couple of weeks to think about it would have delivered the message.\nIt is time that the disciplinary system for all major international tournaments came under the auspices of World Rugby, which all too often is not allowed to be the game\u2019s governing body. It is the way to ensure greater consistency.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae8869b60a802496e92ed83dce03c5e5c560fb78/64_99_3718_2231/master/3718.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14dd863c47b573689102409bfb0812f3"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/19/forgotten-story-english-football-suspension-dilemma-1947-first-division-june-finish": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/19/forgotten-story-english-football-suspension-dilemma-1947-first-division-june-finish", "title": "The forgotten story of ...

The government was determined to drive up productivity in British factories as the country tried to get back on its feet after the second world war, and felt that eliminating the distraction of midweek sport would help in that endeavour (cricket was left out because it didn\u2019t distract many people of working age).\nThe problem from football\u2019s perspective was it had been a uniquely vicious winter, with snow still swirling around the country towards the start of spring. On 10 March, the weekend before the government summons, 17 of the 44 scheduled league games were called off; 16 March, the day before executives from the Football League and FA met to discuss the issue, was the seventh consecutive Saturday league fixtures were postponed.\n\u201cMany grounds are flooded, some are still frozen and others are covered with varying amounts of ice, water and snow,\u201d reported the Guardian. First Division Blackpool had played 34 league games; Sheffield United 26. There was an unprecedented amount of football still to squeeze into the season, and only a few weekends remaining.\nThere was some dissent to the government\u2019s proposals. \u201cThe percentage of the British public who attend midweek sport is infinitesimal,\u201d said the chairman of the Rugby League Council, WH Hughes, who was refused permission to play midweek games after 6pm. Greyhound fans protested outside the Home Office, without success. \u201cThe moral effect on the people [could] be disastrous,\u201d said Will Cearns, the chairman of West Ham and director of Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium. \u201cThe whole idea is incredible. I believe that opinion against a midweek sports ban will be so strong that it will never come into force.\u201d\nThe government held firm, and sport fell into line. Two of the great fixtures on the horse racing calendar \u2013 the Grand National and the Epsom Derby \u2013 moved from their traditional Friday slots to Saturday. The National has stayed there ever since, while the Derby had an extended flirtation with Wednesdays before moving back to the weekend.\n\u201cAssociated with the problem of completing the fixture list \u2013 which seems insoluble in the circumstances \u2013 is the question of whether to call the big issues of the season \u2013 promotion and relegation \u2013 off, or whether to award the prizes and hand out the penalties despite the differing number of fixtures fulfilled,\u201d wrote JT Bolton in the Observer. \u201cThe null and void line is the one likely to receive the greatest volume of support.\u201d\nThey decided instead to extend the season to 14 June, though in fact only two league fixtures were scheduled for June: Sheffield United\u2019s home games against Arsenal, on the seventh, and Stoke a week later. \u201cIt is understood that the possibility of matches behind closed doors was not discussed, and that the meeting did not consider any alternative scheme to the one adopted, which met with unanimous approval,\u201d wrote the Guardian.\nAnd so they played on. At the time the decision was made Wolves were four points clear at the top having played a game fewer than Liverpool and four fewer than Blackpool, their nearest challengers, who were divided by goal average. Middlesbrough, Manchester United and Stoke lingered just below.\nThe following weekend the leaders visited the Blades and lost. Over Easter they lost another two games in three days, and for one night dropped to second (albeit one point behind Blackpool with an improbable five games in hand). Other teams were finding form: over Easter Stoke played three games in four days, won them all and kept going. Liverpool lost to Blackpool that Saturday, but then won six of their next seven. By mid-May Wolves led only on goal average, from Manchester United. One point behind them sat Liverpool and Stoke, who had not lost since the decision to extend the season.\nBut the Potters had suffered one significant blow. On 10 May a Great Britain v Rest of Europe match was played at Hampden Park. On the morning of the game Stoke agreed to sell Stanley Matthews to Blackpool \u2013 the papers were signed in the player\u2019s hotel room that evening \u2013 and Stoke went into the most important run of fixtures in their history without their greatest player. The relationship between Matthews and the board had collapsed, and the 32-year-old felt unwanted by the manager, Bob McGrory, who was building a new, young team. Though the original plan had been for him to remain at Stoke until the end of the season \u201cwhen hopefully we would win the championship and negotiations for my move could begin\u201d it unravelled when the press got wind of it.\nGoing into the last day of the month Wolves, Stoke and Liverpool had a game to play, were separated by only a point, and any of them could win the league, while United were second on goal average but had completed their fixtures and were out of the race. Wolves knew victory at home to Liverpool would secure them the title, but any other result would blow the race open. Stoke just had to watch, with their final fixture still a fortnight away. Liverpool were 2-0 up at half-time and held on to win 2-1. Wolves, four points clear on Christmas Day and only once and fleetingly off the top since, were toppled at the last, and Stoke had a fortnight to prepare for the most important game in their history.\nTwo days before the match the players and directors, in their infinite wisdom, travelled to Buxton for the annual \n. \u201cAfter lunch the party visited the Pavilion Gardens and pleasantly whiled away the afternoon at bowls, tennis and putting,\u201d reported the Staffordshire Sentinel. \u201cSupporters can rest assured that all the boys will do their utmost to win this most vital match,\u201d said Jock Kirton, the captain, presumably during a short break between unrelated leisure pursuits. Still, Stoke were fully fit while the Blades were without three of their best players and ended up picking Jack Pickering, the 38-year-old club captain, for the only time that season. Pickering set up the final goal in a 2-1 win and instead of taking the title Stoke finished fourth, still their highest league finish.\nThe match ball was spirited to Merseyside, where it was presented to Liverpool\u2019s hospitalised chairman, William McConnell. England\u2019s longest league campaign was finally over, won by a club that first topped the table when the final whistle blew on the final fixture; the Liverpool Echo concluded that \u201cno side mixes glorious uncertainty with uncertain glory more than Liverpool\u201d. A new season kicked off 70 days later, midweek fixtures restored.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e39457e551d4760c1e1c0a9c789bd911158ab9/0_0_2805_1682/master/2805.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a034860182b0bed8fb0cb2d1bddffc1b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/19/liga-mx-gold-the-best-of-the-xfl-and-absentee-handshakes": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/19/liga-mx-gold-the-best-of-the-xfl-and-absentee-handshakes", "title": "Liga MX gold, the best of the XFL and absentee handshakes | Classic YouTube", "published": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 10:00:50 GMT", "summary": "<p>This week\u2019s roundup also features Ronaldinho\u2019s prison kickabout and a tribute to Martin Fourcade</p><p>1) Whilst the rest of the sporting world is shutting down, the relatively low spread of coronavirus in Mexico means that Liga MX was one of the few major global football leagues still playing matches last weekend.

La Maquina\u2019s last title was secured in almost equally dramatic and certainly more violent circumstances than their aforementioned loss.

But as I\u2019ve had to remind myself so many times over the past couple of weeks: you\u2019re not an epidemiologist, Marina. Listen to the experts; in this case, the vice-chair of West Ham.\nIn many ways it feels unfair to single out any particular master or mistress of the footballing universe for mild sarcasm. From Brady\u2019s bunch of arse to de\u2011facto virus\u2011modelling from Uefa, who seem to be speculating that Istanbul could well be fine in June, Big Sport is struggling to pivot to its new position of immense irrelevance.\nNot that a form of lip service isn\u2019t being paid. Arguably the most unintentionally comic pose is that of the sporting big cheese taking magisterial care to explain to you there are more important things than sport right now. Is that a fact? Like me, you probably had no idea there were, until a member of Her Majesty\u2019s Sports Press enlightened you.\nBut of course the self-importance goes much higher. In this vein, it is absolutely no surprise to receive a lengthy statement from the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in which he informed the planet: \u201cCooperation, mutual respect and understanding must be the guiding principles for all decision-makers to have in mind at this crucial moment in time.\u201d Something for the director-general of the World Health Organization to take on board, there. I\u2019m sure it means so much more to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, coming from one Swiss\u2011headquartered chief executive to another.\nEven well-meaning gestures seem like acts of absurdist theatre. On Tuesday, Sky Sports made a public announcement that pubs will not be charged for their Sky Sports accounts during this period of no sport. And, indeed, this period of no pubs.\nAgainst this backdrop of wild malfunction and warp-speed recalibration, then, comes the Breaking! News! that \n, or at least it will on current estimates. The decision was reached in Uefa\u2019s Tuesday conference call, a telephonic fixture trailed slightly more portentously than a second-tier Champions League tie. The announcement would have seemed unthinkable once upon a time (ie two weeks ago). But this week it was largely met with the sort of seismic shock you\u2019d expect to greet the news that your club\u2019s second-choice right-back was likely to be out this weekend with a thigh strain.\nThe Premier League will be next out of the traps, of course, with their \u201ccrunch talks\u201d scheduled for Thursday. I note from football dispatches that \n will be \u201cworst hit\u201d by the mounting fixture backlog and there is a \u201cgenuine fear\u201d the season may not be able to be played out. Which does feel like it should place maybe three or four on the list of \u201cgenuine fears\u201d doing the rounds.\nIn some ways the most fascinating reaction to the implication of the postponement is those who have retreated into the familiar comfort of simply assessing where the England team may be in terms of development one year after scheduled kick-off. If your way of dealing with existential stress is to say, look: it\u2019s going to give Phil Foden a whole extra year to be brought on \u2026 then, you know, fine. Whatever gets you through it. But I would be failing in my duties as a human if I didn\u2019t say: are you OK? Do you want me to get some shopping in for you?\nWe\u2019re in the relatively early stages of a deadly pandemic and the leader of the free world is Donald Actual Trump, while our prime minister is Boris Actual Johnson. I feel like wondering if Dean Henderson will be pushing Jordan Pickford for the England goalkeeper spot is at best a slight swerve of the main point and at worst not quite the swings\u2011and\u2011roundabouts positive it\u2019s being billed as. Though your footballing fundamentals are doubtless sound, even working through them out loud feels considerably less rational than even the Twitter user I saw react to the \n postponement with the deathless analysis \u201cfuck the person who ate the fucking bat\u201d.\nThen again, why cavil? There is a strong displacement activity feel to a lot of these high-level discussions and which of us can say we aren\u2019t in need of a bit of that right now? If you, me, or anyone else can even momentarily distract themselves with the ins and outs of how Uefa may reach this or that decision that will almost certainly be overtaken by events infinitely bigger than it, then let\u2019s have it. Social goods come in many forms and we\u2019ll have plenty of time to be surprised by some of the more recherch\u00e9 ones in the months ahead.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc77593047edc5c23cf62f383339649a90824aee/0_22_5185_3111/master/5185.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f615abc9b64b260e1464d07973d8b15a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/amateur-junior-cricket-coronavirus-crisis-ecb-hundred": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/amateur-junior-cricket-coronavirus-crisis-ecb-hundred", "title": "How will club cricket survive the coronavirus crisis? | Barney Ronay", "published": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 18:04:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>The decision to suspend all levels of cricket is the right one in the escalating coronavirus crisis - but it leaves clubs in grave danger while the Hundred\u2019s debut season looks in doubt</p><p>The doomsday clock ticked a little closer to midnight for cricket\u2019s summer of 2020 when the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Wednesday that all recreational cricket should be suspended indefinitely.</p><p>A letter from the chief executive, Tom Harrison, to county boards, clubs and leagues said the decision was based on medical guidance.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/amateur-junior-cricket-coronavirus-crisis-ecb-hundred\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "he doomsday clock ticked a little closer to midnight for cricket\u2019s summer of 2020 when the England and Wales \n Board announced on Wednesday that all recreational cricket should be suspended indefinitely.\nA letter from the chief executive, Tom Harrison, to county boards, clubs and leagues said the decision was based on medical guidance.\n\u201cFollowing the Government\u2019s latest advice around social distancing, it is with sadness and reluctance that we recommend that all forms of recreational cricket are for now suspended.\u201d\nThis will come as no surprise given the staged lockdown of all public activities. Earlier this week the Football Association advised that all levels of the amateur game be suspended. The Rugby Football Union has advised similar suspension in amateur and junior rugby. The ECB\u2019s move is just further confirmation of the potentially disastrous state of amateur and grassroots sport in coming months.\nThe crisis is a visitation that extends far beyond sport, just as the decision to suspend non-professional cricket is unarguably the right course. The MCC\u2019s 1901 touring party to South Africa may have played a Test series during a local outbreak of bubonic plague but the Covid-19 pandemic requires industrial scale micromanagement.\nThe question remains, though: what will be left when it passes? Club cricket in particular finds itself in considerable peril, placed directly in the path of the coming lockdown. This is a sport where the annual revenue stream runs from April to September, where mid-season will coincide with the expected peak-infection period in England.\nMuch of the hand-wringing over sporting cancellations has focused on how industries that are essentially drowning in money will fulfil their televised fixtures. In the shadow of this, community sports clubs that fill the role of social hub, physical activity centre and entry point to children\u2019s sport are set to lose their sole source of income.\nIt is extremely likely many will be forced to close if no alternative can be found. Most clubs rely on the standard input of match fees, fundraisers, annual membership and the club bar, with junior cricket in particular a regular source of cash and new members.\nAt the same time iIt seems inevitable school sport will also now be suspended. Following the ECB\u2019s advice would mean the English Schools Cricket Association\u2019s entire summer fixture list is affected. All county age group, borough and district cricket is in peril. The Bunbury festival must be looking on anxiously.\nThe potential loss should be judged not just in revenue to clubs but in those who will support, play and watch the game in the future. One club committee member said: \u201cSince the \n announcement I have been inundated with concerned messages from clubs and community facilities used by clubs. They all face financial ruin without cricket income. These are pillars of the community and we cannot forget those low-income seasonal workers who rely entirely on the income from coaching and ground work over the summer.\u201d\n\u201cClubs were telling me they were planning on doing numerous one-to-one and small group coaching activities. With the message to cease all cricket-related activities, all bets are off. What troubles me most is that junior cricket, the financial lifeblood of the game, could be salvaged with some imagination.\u201d\nWho will stand against this? The obvious first port of call is the ECB, whose articles of association state that its role is to \u201cbe responsible for the organisation, promotion and fostering of cricket\u201d and \u201cto support and assist the recreational game\u201d.\nThe ECB acknowledged the importance of clubs in its statement on Wednesday and announced some understandably vague plans to \u201csupport some levels of physical activity in communities \u2013 particularly at junior levels.\u201d\n\u201cWe understand that countless hours of work from thousands of volunteers have already gone into getting ready for the 2020 season and we know how disappointing this will be. We are thankful for the huge role that volunteers play in local cricket, to ensure the game remains at the heart of communities.\n\u201cWe know that you and your clubs can play an important role in bringing your community together once we get past this period of time.\u201d\nNotably absent from these warm words is any promise of financial support in the form of emergency grants or loans. More worryingly still, this is also understandable.\nThe ECB has made much of its commitment to investing in grassroots cricket. To date its most profound investment has been in the Hundred, a new competition designed for an as-yet undiscovered audience, which now finds itself threatened with a disastrous cancellation in its first season.\nThe ECB was criticised by some for accumulating large reserves of cash and sitting on them. It was criticised by others for spending that cash on the gaudy new investment. As clubs up and down the country contemplate a future with no obvious income source, that expense starts to look like a doomed high-stakes gamble at the most unfortunate of times.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f76a7938a6e3f7a5ed9377c8761c588222789c/0_26_6444_3867/master/6444.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1fc64ac408dfdc8c9137908afb4f1883"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/new-england-patriots-tom-brady-leaves-nfl-football-boston": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/new-england-patriots-tom-brady-leaves-nfl-football-boston", "title": "Hated by Them, loved by Us.

There was a pandemic to slow down, after all, and there was no time for fun and games. Literally, in fact, as the Celtics, Bruins and Red Sox had all suspended play for the foreseeable future. So things were already set to be bleak on Tuesday morning even before New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady made the announcement that \n he has ever played for. In a few sentences, Brady effectively closed the book on his Patriots tenure and an entire era of Boston sports.\nNobody expected anything from Brady when the Patriots drafted him out of the University of Michigan with the 199\n pick of the 2000 NFL draft. It was inconceivable that he would develop into one of the greatest players \u2013 many will tell you \n best \u2013 in \n history. Brady began his rookie season as the fourth-string quarterback, a role that barely exists in the modern game. Head coach Bill Belichick seemed to have an idea of what he had early in Brady\u2019s second season when he made the fateful decision to turn to him to replace an injured Drew Bledsoe, then the face of the franchise. Brady would go on to win 11 of the 14 games he started in the 2001 season, eventually leading the team to victory over the St Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. New England would clear up any further quarterback controversy by trading Bledsoe to Buffalo Bills over the offseason. From that moment on, Brady was the Patriots.\nBrady\u2019s emergence marked the start of the Patriots dynasty, as the team would go on to be the most consistently successful team in the NFL. Under Belichick\u2019s guidance, Brady would eventually appear in a record nine Super Bowls, winning six of them and being named MVP in four. The Patriots\u2019 success ended up being contagious. Following the Patriots\u2019 second Super Bowl in 2004, the Boston Red Sox reversed 86 years of agony by winning the 2004 World Series, the first of what would be four championships in the 21\n century. The Boston Celtics and \n Bruins, after substantial title droughts, became perennial postseason threats, winning titles in 2008 and 2011 respectively.\nIn the midst of all this success and \n, it was inevitable that Brady\u2019s public image would transform. It soon became difficult to remember that Brady\u2019s career began as the all-time underdog story, the sixth-round draft pick who replaced the star quarterback and led his team to an unlikely Super Bowl victory. The one-time David soon became the league\u2019s ultimate Goliath, as the constant winning transformed the team into the most hated team in the league. A run at \n, memorably shut down by Eli Manning and the New York Giants in the first of their two upset Super Bowl victories over the Pats, cemented New England\u2019s role as heels. That role was exacerbated \n that called into question the legitimacy of the Patriots dynasty. Brady\u2019s career has not remained untainted as \n at the start of the 2016 season for using improperly inflated footballs.\nOutside of New England, there will probably always be something of a black mark on Brady\u2019s career. Inside of New England, the main thing fans took away from the \u201cDeflategate\u201d scandal was that the quarterback \n by coming back from his suspension to win his fifth Super Bowl, adding a sixth just two years later. If anything, the negative press caused fans to rally around Brady even harder. As popular opinion built against the Patriots over the years, an \u201cUs v Them\u201d narrative began to form among Boston fans. \u201cThey hate us because they ain\u2019t us,\u201d \n and Tom Brady was very much Us.\nUntil now, that is. Brady leaving the Patriots marks the decisive end of an era, one that would be shocking if the writing hadn\u2019t been on the wall over the course of the 2019 season. After years of holding off Father Time, the 42-year-old Brady was starting to show his age over the last year \u2013 for one of the few times in his career he wasn\u2019t even chosen for the Pro Bowl \u2013 and his disappointing offensive year was a key reason why the Patriots ended up \n. Something that had worked so well for so long just couldn\u2019t function anymore, and now free agency has torn Brady and the team apart.\nSo where do the Patriots go from here? It\u2019s possible that losing Brady could end up forcing the Patriots to move onto a brand new era of success. Bill Belichick has won six championships with the team \u2013 and has established himself as one of the greatest head coaches in NFL history, despite his sometimes ethically dubious methods \u2013 so one would think that there would be no trails left for him to blaze. Yet, one thing has \n in New England: how much of it was because of his \u201cgenius\u201d and how much was it was that he had Brady. If he could win one last Super Bowl with a new quarterback, it would go a long way towards settling that argument. Maybe it will turn out that the Patriots dynasty wasn\u2019t as much about Brady as it seemed.\nBut another title in the near future feels highly unlikely. Brady and Belichick represented a perfect football marriage where the sum was ultimately greater than the parts. Even a declining Brady will prove nearly impossible to replace. The Patriots should still be competitive going forward, but it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling that a golden age of Boston sports has come to a sudden end.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc744f13cde1e07e4a7dc997d63c3b25ec1cb20c/0_440_5024_3013/master/5024.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70c66cd33407bddf56cfc55d3cc273a5"}}, "Entertaniment & Arts": {"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/the-perfect-time-to-start-how-book-clubs-are-enduring-and-flourishing-during-covid-19", "title": "'The perfect time to start': how book clubs are enduring and flourishing during Covid-19", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:45:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the world goes into lockdown, reading groups are moving to Zoom, Twitter and Instagram to bring readers together</p><p>\u2022 Scroll down for a list of book clubs you can join</p><p>My book club was the first to concede defeat.

We had not even settled on our next book yet, such was our preemptive commitment to self-isolation. As our host said, the book club had already been in quarantine for months.\nAs the Covid-19 crisis has confined us to our homes, a sliver of a silver lining (entirely inadequate, of course, but we look for them all the same) is that it has provided a chance to catch up on our reading. Being mostly solitary and indoors, it is one of the few pursuits that remain unchanged in this new world, while affording us access to others. With every connected device a potential portal for anxiety, it may never have felt so necessary to escape into the printed word.\n People have started sharing pictures of books they have stockpiled for self-isolation under the hashtag #CoronavirusReadingStack. \u201cPanic buying,\u201d \n. \u201cDo I have enough books to last?\u201d \n as though her library choices were toilet paper.\nThe internet has allowed new book clubs to form, in spite of self-isolation and lockdowns.

Some participants have even purchased extra copies of the book for those who cannot afford them.\n\u201cLiterature has always done such an extraordinary job of provoking community and conversation \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise to me that it should be doing so, so powerfully now,\u201d says Macfarlane.\nLondoner Tania Hardcastle had been meaning to start a book club for a while before coronavirus cleared her schedule: \u201cI thought it would be the perfect time to start.\u201d\nShe and her friends Sharlene Gandhi and Priya Shah received such a response to\n \u2013 including from \n, the author of the first book they chose, \n \u2013 that they had to cap membership at 15 people. Their planned Google hangout \u201cmight become unmanageable otherwise,\u201d says Hardcastle.\nCommunities have not just formed online; they have migrated there. \u201cReal life\u201d book clubs more disciplined than mine have already relocated to virtual meeting rooms such as Google Hangouts, or the suddenly ubiquitous video-conferencing platform \n.\nSarah West, an academic based in York, has hosted her seven-person book club around her dining table each month, for three years. Last Monday, they gathered to discuss \n on Zoom. After initial hellos \u2013 \u201cso that we could see each other\u2019s setup: \u2018Here I am sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea\u2019, \u2018Here I am at my table with a glass of wine\u2019\u201d \u2013 cameras were turned off to save on bandwidth and batteries.\nWithout cues from body language, and with only one person able to speak at a time, the discussion required \u201cmore active management\u201d than usual, says West. But \u201cit went really well \u2013 so well that I woke up the next day and thought, \u2018God, I haven\u2019t cleaned up after book club last night.\u2019 It was quite a long time before I went downstairs and realised it had just been me, sat on the sofa. It felt really genuine.\u201d\nWith her energies split between work and her two young children, West says it was a relief to find that her book club would not be disrupted. \u201cI have confidence that, at least once a month, it\u2019s going to feel like I\u2019ve had a night off, being sociable.\u201d\nThe relaxed formality of book clubs might be a boon as we adjust to the age of the \u201cvideo hang\u201d, lending structure to an unfamiliar and often stilted interaction. Virtual pub quizzes are proving similarly popular right now.\n\u2019s book club, based in Beaconsfield, has moved through several platforms in 15 years \u2013 from email to WhatsApp and now, Zoom.

In a way, that\u2019s good.\nIt\u2019s hard not to [\n] be constantly thinking about, you know, rather more pressing matters. The cleanliness of door handles, for example. The intensity of other people\u2019s coughs, or how far to veer away from each other on the pavements while out on your government-mandated walk.

How desperate for entertainment we will have to be to plunge ourselves into going on YouTube and watching a vlog. Right now, these are my worries. It\u2019s nice of Kim Kardashian to try to distract me with something totally and utterly facile and pointless at a time of global crisis.\nOn the other hand, come on. To help you catch up, this all truly started \n, when Swift was 20 and Kardashian was three years away from even dating Kanye, in fact was still at the \u201cCarl\u2019s Jr advert and a guest appearance at WrestleMania\u201d level of fame. In 2016, Kanye released the song Famous, featuring the eternally controversial lyric: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift rightly took exception to having her career as one of the most successful singer-songwriters in global history getting reduced down to \u201cthat bitch\u201d.\nAt which point Kardashian \u2013 now an ascendent, royalty-level celebrity, married in a palace \u2013 released a Snapchat video of Kanye on the phone to Swift before the song was even recorded, openly discussing the lyrical content. The intimation was: Swift knew about the lyric, she fully had the heads up, she can\u2019t be mad at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in one of the biggest songs of 2016, and by being in any way upset at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d she is somehow Playing The Game. This is the natural starting point of our feud.\nI have gone through some changing feelings about Swift over the years, because I don\u2019t really like her music \u2013 which is a fine and normal opinion to have. But something about the hugeness of Swift, and her ubiquity, makes \u201cnot really liking the sounds she makes\u201d become something close to political. Here\u2019s a rough Marmite analogy for you. Swift is the semi-popular yeast spread Marmite, in that if you love her, you love her with an intensity that blocks out the sun; if you don\u2019t, she leaves you utterly cold. But because her songs constantly loop on the A-list of society, you cannot escape Marmite, and now you\u2019re starting to really get rubbed up the wrong way by Marmite.\nEvery Friday afternoon, all the people in the office take control of the shared kitchen and make you eat a slice of bread and Marmite. At every wedding you are at, there is a tangible point in the evening when everyone, fuzzy drunk and joyful, kicks their shoes off and loudly heaps an entire spoon of Marmite into your mouth. Every time you tell someone you don\u2019t like Marmite, they bore on at you for ages about how much umami her new album adds to stews and bologneses. At this point, you cannot avoid Marmite, because every advert is for Marmite and every time Marmite releases a new jar, every headline is about Marmite, and how Marmite \u201cdid that\u201d. Despite not even liking Marmite, you somehow know about Marmite\u2019s thing with Tom Hiddleston where he wore that vest.\nAnd now your feelings about Marmite aren\u2019t about Marmite any more. They are fixed towards the celebratory Marmite culture that has been built around it, one you are constantly on the outside of, looking in. \nAnyway, this week the full and explicit 25-minute video of Kanye\u2019s call to Taylor in 2016 \n. It went a fair way to vindicating Swift and making it clear she was unprepared to be called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in the song. And Swift reacted to the leak \n on Instagram: \u201cInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that \n edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years) \u2026 SWIPE up to see what really matters.\u201d And she added a link to various charity organisations supporting those on low income in the whole global pandemic thing. Kardashian responded by going on \n.\nIt\u2019s actually quite fascinating how badly Kardashian has played this one, because normally the dynasty is so good at upselling bad news in a way that just makes them richer and more adored. In the past few years they have managed to turn secret pregnancies, cheating scandals, Kanye\u2019s personal debt and the Kendall Jenner Pepsi advert into major PR wins. Each time, Kardashian somehow comes out of each one more regal and elegant and more on the cover of Vogue. \nBut her feud with Swift has been a bum note from the off. What is it that Swift has been doing wrong, again? Being slightly too earnest in a hard-edged industry that clomps her around like a pair of shoes in a tumble dryer? Being gracefully tight-lipped in the face of years of provocation? Linking to a charity organisation on Instagram? Not liking being called a bitch? At this point, whatever your feelings about Marmite, it\u2019s really hard not to take its side in the face of relentless attempts by Nutella to reignite a feud with it.\nA word on Comrade Britney, now, to whose revolution I offer humbly my hands and heart. While Kim Kardashian has been holed up in a Calabasas mansion going on about arguments that happened an entire World Cup cycle ago, Britney Spears has been a sunbeam of support to her fans throughout this pandemic, offering aid to those who are struggling and reaching out to her via DM. And, in really quite an unexpected zig, she has amplified an artist\u2019s call for a general strike and a \n. All right, Britney, let\u2019s \u2026 all right man. Let\u2019s do this. Drag them out by their hair.\nOn Instagram, Britney \n a quote from the writer Mimi Zhu, saying: \u201cDuring this time of isolation, we need connection now more than ever [\u2026] We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay. Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.\u201d\nPersonally, I\u2019m a little unsure how much of that Britney actually meant. Over the course of her long career, she has only touched on politics once or twice, endorsing the Iraq war, being registered in Louisiana as a Republican (in 2001) and, in 2017, encouraging her followers to support the Dream Act, which would have offered legal status to undocumented immigrants who went to school in the US. So, \u201ca mixed bag\u201d. But then, in a nice font and on an orange background, and talking so charmingly about reaching out to friends and family \u2026 it does sort of look like a generically wholesome Instagram quote, if you squint and look at it.\nLike \u2026 you really have to read down to see the bit about taking the wealth and striking hard. I still back her pivot to communism to the hilt. And who among us hasn\u2019t accidentally called for a revolution by sharing a meme they liked on Instagram? If she comes out of this with a Vegas show that calls for us to bring society crumbling down and rebuild it again from the rubble up, cool. And if she doesn\u2019t? That is also OK. Stay safe, \n. Stay golden.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51e9871f92321546e0364325ade19312b1aecc64/1_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c6075bd659dcf36bc864f9a3f38f9ba"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/alice-coltrane-jazz-spiritual-back-catalogue": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/alice-coltrane-jazz-spiritual-back-catalogue", "title": "Alice Coltrane: where to start in her back catalogue", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:40:13 GMT", "summary": "<p>In Listener\u2019s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. In this instalment, how to navigate the wildly esoteric recordings of jazz pioneer Alice Coltrane</p><p><strong>Journey in Satchidananda (1971)</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/alice-coltrane-jazz-spiritual-back-catalogue\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The first thing to understand about composer and musician Alice Coltrane\u2019s catalogue is that there are no duds. Jump in anywhere and you\u2019ll find variations on the signature sound that developed from her beginnings in bebop jazz, through the spiritual free compositions of the Coltranes as a romantic and spiritual unit (\n died of liver cancer in 1967, four years after they met), to the transcendental sounds of her later divine music.\nBut you have to start somewhere, so make it Journey in Satchidananda, a mid-point between the modal and meditative,\nwhere all the parts of her musical being and biography are present. In its opening (title) track, there are all the aspects of Alice Coltrane\u2019s music \u2013 jazz player Cecil McBee lays down a double bass motif, joined by a sharp drone from an Indian tamboura, then Coltrane\u2019s sparkling harp pours in like cool water as Pharoah Sanders\u2019s saxophone dances over the top. It is an audaciously lush theme for her guru, Swami Satchidananda, and like so much of Coltrane\u2019s composition it is positively cinematic, suggesting the opening of luxurious drapes on a panoramic vista. It ought strictly to be called fusion music, with elements taken from Indian music and combined with western traditions, but in Coltrane\u2019s music there are no visible joins \u2013 all is bound in cosmic opulence.\nThere is a sub-catalogue to this primer, which is the music of John and Alice. They met in 1963 when Alice was on tour as a member of the Terry Gibbs Quartet. After John\u2019s divorce they married and she joined his band, playing on albums including Infinity and Expression. They made one duo album, Cosmic Music. John died suddenly, leaving Alice as a single mother with four children, but she continued to work on the music they had been developing. World Galaxy\nincludes Alice\u2019s renderings of two of John\u2019s signature tunes \u2013 it was not the first or the last time she did this, but there is a ferocious power and emotion in these versions of A Love Supreme and My Favorite Things.\nRecorded over two days with a 16-piece string orchestra, World Galaxy features Alice playing piano, harp and organ. My Favorite Things starts sweetly but descends into a chaotic breakdown as her organ flares in anxious bursts. The album closes with the salvation of A Love Supreme, which is soothingly narrated by Swami Satchidananda before she lets loose a rude funk upon the standard\u2019s signature motif.\nColtrane\u2019s own music was always about collaboration, whether with other players or other cultures \u2013 this entry could equally have been Ptah the El Daoud, with Pharoah Sanders. The Elements, based on the four elements and recorded with saxophonist Joe Henderson (who also plays on Ptah), is a triumph of concept. Variously credited to Joe Henderson, or Joe Henderson with Alice Coltrane, its first track, Fire, opens with Charlie Haden\u2019s burning bassline, a lick setting up a suite that moves through Air, Water and Earth. It is an immaculately conceived and executed project and Alice\u2019s sound looms large. The pieces all sound like their titles, from the light and ephemeral Air to the fluid and rippling delay deployed on Water and the grounded groove on Earth.\nColtrane later took the spiritual name Turiyasangitananda, which roughly means \u201cthe Lord\u2019s highest song of bliss\u201d. By the mid-80s she was recording spiritual music and releasing it as private press tapes on her own Avatar Book Institute. \n gathering selections from the albums Divine Songs, Infinite Chants and Glorious Chants (but missing out Turiya Sings, which is also essential).\nDivine Songs is the best, a mind-blowing psychedelic vision of what transcendence might sound like. Its lavish string sections and sung chants combine with luminous synths whose pitch arches upwards as if in salutation. It\u2019s an unbeatable cosmic power-up. Coltrane is not often considered the creator of synthesiser masterpieces, but this album demands a reassessment in that respect.\nWhether she is taking a section of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and making it a journey through the clouds (Going Home), or playing wild free jazz on Wurlitzer organ and harp, much of Coltrane\u2019s astral wonderland is arguably one for the heads. So rather than sending you to a lost cut, an \n or a track from her Ashram cassettes that nobody can find unless they\u2019re pro online diggers, here\u2019s Spiritual Eternal, from her one of her most \u201cmainstream\u201d albums, Eternity.\nEternity never gets much credit in her catalogue. It is short and lacks the coherence of her other releases. However, this opening track is wildly underrated, the huge Wurlitzer solo swaddled in strings, like the theme tune to someone parading down a palatial staircase in a silken gown (AKA the perfect soundtrack for waltzing down your own stairs in a dressing gown). What swing! What elegance!\nIn 2002 Edwin Pouncey interviewed Coltrane for Wire magazine at her California ashram, which burned down in the 2018 wildfires. Pouncey\u2019s portrait (with beautiful photography by Jake Walters) places her in a historical context while illuminating her uniqueness and awe-inspiring presence. His statement that \u201cthe music of Alice Coltrane is more relevant today than when it was first recorded between 1968-78\u201d is followed by speculation that \u201cperhaps the need for spiritual salvation is that much greater in a world apparently bent on self destruction\u201d \u2013 a sentiment that rings as true today.\nThere is a wealth of great reading about Coltrane, but she also wrote about her spiritual life herself, including this small pamphlet recounting the revelations and trials she underwent in the late 60s. Monument Eternal is not an autobiography, but a hallucinatory, esoteric text that she introduces as \u201ca book about my true spiritual experiences and spiritual suffering which has never ceased even unto this present day\u201d.\nFor Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, \n.\n What\u2019s your favourite Alice Coltrane album?

He was told he had basically eaten his last cookie: that he was never going to have a relationship again. He thought that life was over for him but then out of that came this incredibly hopeful play about love after there is no hope of love. Even though you see the pair of them in this raw, sexual act, completely nude at the beginning of the show, they are really at their most closed off.\nThe play follows the journey that Frankie and Johnny take to becoming vulnerable with each other. Frankie is a wonderful character. She is so closed off and damaged, she has PTSD as a victim of domestic violence, and she protects herself with her sense of humour and by remaining alone. Then Johnny comes in and blows that to smithereens. Frankie\u2019s struggle is one of opening up, then shutting down and being frightened about it, then finally giving up all resistance.\nTerrence was not only a colleague and a collaborator but a mentor and a very dear friend, someone I leaned on. So this is a hard loss for me. He was the kindest man, wickedly funny, and still so jovial and innocent and wide-eyed about what we do for a living, the magic of theatre and of actors and writers.

Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. \u201cI know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.\u201d She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. \u201cFor younger professional women, it\u2019s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.\u201d\nAl-Mansour is Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, \n, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (\u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. \u2018Do that!\u2019 \u2018Pull the camera back!\u2019\u201d) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (\u201cOne of them told me they had a coffin ready for me\u201d). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy.\nThe new film is another inspiring story of female resistance, this time about a young female doctor who runs, almost by accident, for office in local elections. This time around, following the easing of restrictions segregating men and women, Al-Mansour could work in public. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the van this time,\u201d she grins. \u201cI was shouting at all my crew in person!\u201d\nWe meet in London on International Women\u2019s Day, when social distancing is still a novelty. Walking into the cafe, 5ft-nothing in her Converse, she shakes my hand and then, mindful of the breach of etiquette, reaches into her handbag for a bottle of hand sanitiser and squirts me a dollop. The exchange smacks of her mix of warmth and no-nonsense.\n Four years ago, Al-Mansour moved from Bahrain to Los Angeles with her American husband Bradley Neimann, a diplomat, and their son, Adam, 12, and daughter, Hailey, 10. (\u201cThey are very American,\u201d she says of her kids. \u201cThey say \u2018dude\u2019 with an American accent.\u201d) But she missed home and so she wrote The Perfect Candidate, which stars the impossibly beautiful TV actor Mila Al Zahrani as Dr Maryam, a supremely capable young medic working in a rundown hospital (healthcare is a major employer of women). The film catches society in the midst of a transformation, at a moment when women have more freedom, but society is slow to embrace them. When Maryam holds an all-female fundraiser, the response is depressing: \u201cMy husband will kill me if I vote for you.\u201d \u201cI hope you win, but I don\u2019t vote.\u201d I\u2019m not giving anything away to say that Maryam has a tough time of it on the campaign trail \u2013 laughed at, patronised by a TV presenter, criticised as shrill and unfeminine.\nWas Al-Mansour making a more universal point? \u201cYeah, they are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton. But seeing women in leadership positions is something people need to get used to.\u201d\nAt the start of the film Maryam wears the niqab; as she grows more confident in her identity it comes off. What did Al-Mansour want to say about the veil? \u201cAt the beginning Maryam wants to fit in. And what does society expect of women? To cover up. But at the end she understands what defiance means. It\u2019s about respect. A human being\u2019s identity is in their face. I think face covering is one of the most dangerous things that ever happened to the Muslim culture.\u201d For the first time in our conversation Al-Mansour is deadly serious. \u201cWe need female Muslim scholars who can deconstruct a lot of the literature about a woman\u2019s body and the veil. Like, for example, when I was a kid I was, I was told: \u2018You are like a cake. If you don\u2019t cover it, flies will come.\u2019 So it\u2019s blaming the victim. This is the psychology a lot of Muslim women go through \u2013 they have to cover because they\u2019re responsible for someone\u2019s else\u2019s actions.\u201d\nThe dress code for women has changed in Saudia Arabia, she adds. \n are encouraged not to be completely covered. \u201cBut a lot of women still cling to that because that is taught from the beginning that is what makes them good and chaste and noble.\u201d\nThe film, I think, has demythologising effect, too. It\u2019s a lesson to audiences in the west that behind the abayas and the veils, the women of the Middle East are modern citizens of the world. \u201cSaudi women are sassy and very resourceful,\u201d says Al-Mansour. \u201cYou try to buy a carpet from a Saudi woman; she will take all your money. They are very savvy. \u201d\nAl-Mansour gives the impression of being a natural-born rebel. She grew up in small conservative town, and describes herself as a shy kid, the eighth of 12 children in a liberal house. Her father was a poet. Where does the rebellious streak come from? \u201cMy parents,\u201d she answers quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money, but I feel really privileged. I was respected. My father and my mother never told me: \u2018Because you are a woman you can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d Music filled the house, and as teenager she watched Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies. \u201cWhenever I told people at school I listened to music, they\u2019d be like: \u2018You\u2019re going straight to hell. I don\u2019t want to play with you.\u2019 So, I felt like an outsider.\u201d\nAfter studying literature at the American University in Cairo, she got a marketing job at a Saudi oil company. \u201cIn meetings they would never listen to me. I was invisible.\u201d Al-Mansour began her career in film by making a short films with her siblings. In 2005, she met Neimann at a screening of one of her documentaries at the US embassy in \n where he was working as a cultural attache. When he was posted to Australia, she studied film in Sydney and wrote the script that became Wadjda.\nRight now, Al-Mansour\u2019s plan is to make films in Saudi Arabia and the west. She arrived in Hollywood at the right time, she tells me. \u201cI get a lot of chances. I get a lot of meetings. I have a chance now to build a resum\u00e9 that allows me, hopefully, in a couple of years to direct a really big movie with a big budget.\u201d Would she be up for making a blockbuster? She raises an eyebrow, surprised I would even ask the question. \u201cYes! I think I can make an amazing $100m film. Ten years ago, that would be unheard of, for a film-maker like me who\u2019s not white and who\u2019s not American, who\u2019s not a man.\u201d\n#MeToo and #OscarSoWhite have made real and meaningful differences for women such as Al-Mansour. \u201cWhat happened with Harvey Weinstein was a wake-up call. All the misogyny that we took for granted is not acceptable any more. There is the intention for improvement and it\u2019s up to us women film-makers to take opportunities and run with them and work really hard and show the world what we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n The Perfect Candidate is released in the UK on digital download (\n, \n, \n) on 27 March\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b038006ae6354d780af2ed3de5615ad1e3ec09d7/0_52_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad331f23d581533469c92a1b0e0a052e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/return-of-mr-motivator-joe-wicks-very-different-coronavirus-bbc": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/return-of-mr-motivator-joe-wicks-very-different-coronavirus-bbc", "title": "Mr Motivator makes TV return on BBC to keep Britain fit in lockdown", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:38:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>Fitness star says he is \u2018very different\u2019 to Joe Wicks as he returns amid Covid-19 crisis</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul> <p>Mr Motivator has said he does not feel threatened by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\">success of Joe Wicks</a>, as the pioneering fitness star prepares to return to the nation\u2019s television screens on a new BBC One programme designed to keep the nation healthy during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The presenter, best known for his appearances on GMTV in the 1990s, and his brightly coloured Lycra outfits, told the Guardian he was confident that the public appetite for his broadcasts had not diminished: \u201cMotivator \u2013 you mention my name, and everybody knows Motivator.

Television was interested in the entertainment side of me, not what was deep inside of me ... Physical fitness is only part of the pillars that hold up our wellbeing. Are you in love?

It will be hosted by Michelle Ackerley and Dr Xand van Tulleken, along with Angela Rippon, who is currently self-isolating.\nIn addition Motivator is launching a short daily livestreamed workout at midday every day, titled the Daily Dozen, \n and forthcoming YouTube channel.\nMotivator said his childhood in Jamaica experiencing extreme weather had shaped his approach to the lockdown. \u201cYou learn from a hurricane: you need your health, you need food in the fridge, and we need each other. Hurricanes have a really cleansing effect on us in the Caribbean \u2013 you wave to the neighbours and see if they\u2019re all right. In this case we\u2019re going to have to learn a different kind of language and some positive short-term things we can do to reduce stress levels. Even if it\u2019s just putting a sign in the garden saying \u2018do not disturb\u2019 and going to the garden shed.\u201d\nAsked for his advice for Guardian readers who are self-isolating, Motivator said: \u201cEvery morning when you get up, you should do it with purpose: don\u2019t keep your pyjamas on all day. Get dressed. Put your trainers on. Every hour my alarm clock goes off and reminds me to get up and do something.\n\u201cThen there\u2019s always music on in my home.

Marta Torbidoni makes a lovely Micaela, while Lucas Meacham is a laid-back, more subtle Escamillo than most. This is \n, \n and \n. \nPrime attraction of this Munich staging for Verdi\u2019s bi-centenary in 2013 is the starry pairing of soprano Anja Harteros and Jonas Kaufmann as ill-fated lovers Leonora and Manrico, the singing warrior \u2013 thus eponymous troubadour. With her rich lower range and fine coloratura, Harteros\u2019 singing is rather wonderful and she is a remarkably graceful presence, in part for being required to play Leonora as blind. That was presumably to explain managing to confuse her lover with the baddie Conte di Luna \u2013 the same after-shave? \u2013 but surely unnecessary since mistaken identities and the wrong babies are everywhere in opera. Kaufmann is not an Italianate Manrico, but that hardly matters: he is gloriously passionate and tender both in his love for Leonora and for his gypsy mother, Azucena, whose tortured relationship with her own mother\u2019s death haunts the staging from the outset. Verdi\u2019s music moves inexorably to the tragic ending, yet there is something almost comic and frankly perverse in Olivier Py\u2019s \n spectacle: an elaborate multi-scened revolve, dance, acrobatics, martial arts, and a lot of naked flesh suggest that plot was the least of his priorities. Don\u2019t even bother trying to work out why a single figure beats out the Anvil chorus on a version of Stephenson\u2019s Rocket. Just listen. \nSimon Rattle\u2019s concert with the Berlin Philharmonic on 13 March must rank as one of the strangest of even this conductor\u2019s, this orchestra\u2019s or indeed anybody\u2019s concert experiences. In retrospect it feels worryingly reckless to have gathered the orchestra together one last time without any physical distancing. But at the time it sent a message of human and artistic connection, not in spite of the circumstances but because of them. When large gatherings were banned in Germany on 12 March, concerts were cancelled. Normally, that would have been the end of it, but the Berliners\u2019 concert had been due to be live-streamed on the orchestra\u2019s \nwebsite and so the self-governing musicians decided to go ahead in their empty Philharmonie hall.\nThis, then, was a first: a public concert entirely without the public, life-streamed for free and then available on demand (\n). As weird concert experiences go, this concert of Berio and Bart\u00f3k was right up there. But as the pandemic rages, this concert was a catalyst for the dozens of efforts by self-isolating musicians to adapt their performances to the possibilities of reaching their publics through modern media.\nBack in the Philharmonie, the traditional concert protocols were observed. The musicians dressed up for the event. The orchestra took their places and tuned up. Then the Neue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, the eight singer soloists for Berio\u2019s Sinfonia, entered, followed by Rattle. There was applause, but only from the orchestra and only within the decorous conventions of orchestral music, with string players striking their music stands with their bows and brass and percussion players tapping their instruments.\n, the freewheeling collage written by Berio for the New York Philharmonic in the tumultuous year of 1968, proved a life-enhancing piece for the occasion, teeming with originality and fascinating juxtapositions. \nproduced an altogether more sombre effect, suffused as it is by loneliness and memory, and proving ultimately more powerfully appropriate to the strange isolation of the event. As Rattle had predicted, the oddest moment came when the music ended. He mouthed quiet words of thanks to the players, put his hands together in a gesture of gratitude and prayer and left the stage. The musicians followed silently. For the invisible audience across the world, the music was still alive. Let us pray that Rattle and the orchestra do not come to regret it. \nIn \n recent staging of Bart\u00f3k\u2019s only opera, Bluebeard\u2019s Castle is renamed after its female protagonist. Mitchell prefaces it with a performance of the composer\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra, which becomes the accompaniment to the screening of a film presenting the backstory to her treatment of the narrative. Translated to contemporary London, the central character is now a police detective, sung by \n, who takes on the name Judith when she poses as an escort to trap a serial killer preying on sex workers, drugging and imprisoning them at his home. The opera proper begins on stage (without its spoken prologue) when Bluebeard (\n) and Judith arrive back at his house.\nAs an exercise in dramatic repackaging the production is hard to fault; it\u2019s imaginatively conceived and expertly realised, and superbly sung and acted by Stemme and Lundgren, even if his baritone is not as dark-hued as it might be for the role. But Mitchell\u2019s treatment is essentially reductive. \u201cJudith\u201d may get her man in the end, bringing closure to the drama, but the ambiguity at the heart of the opera as Bart\u00f3k conceived it is destroyed, turning a piece of symbolist music theatre, with a profoundly troubled and troubling central character, into an all-too-familiar TV-style police hunt for a sadomasochistic killer. \n) \n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee0e872d7b857a92b8eaa93942310b5772a9ef9/166_46_1523_914/master/1523.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b137d1bb1166bf365d0455f9760d1747"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/17/hottest-front-room-seats-the-best-theatre-and-dance-to-watch-online": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/17/hottest-front-room-seats-the-best-theatre-and-dance-to-watch-online", "title": "Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch online", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:47:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the coronavirus causes venues to close their doors, an increase of live-streamed theatre is expected.

In the following weeks you can see Sally Cookson\u2019s adaptation of Jane Eyre, Bryony Lavery\u2019s Treasure Island and Twelfth Night starring Tamsin Greig.\nThe Cure\u2019s Robert Smith tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies, because \u2013 all together now \u2013 \n. A powerful piece of rhyme-packed storytelling for the over-eights, Boys Don\u2019t is delivered by four compelling performers and based on real-life experiences of the expectations placed on \u201clittle men\u201d throughout the generations before they even get to the playground. Presented by \n, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018.\nIs there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for \n I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.\nAt first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos \n, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026\nIf you missed its run at \n, here\u2019s a chance to savour Dave Malloy\u2019s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own I\u2019m afraid.\nAll four productions in \n\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service \n which is offering a 30-day free trial. Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband, Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance, Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre\u2019s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest.\n is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d. Key Change, \n, is a fantastic introduction to their consistently impressive work with women who are on the margins of society; in this case, prisoners at HM Prison Low Newton, who \n with the theatre group over several months in order to break down stigma and enlighten audiences. It was filmed in partnership with The Space.\nThe Royal Opera House may have shut its doors but it has opened up its archive for a \n on its Facebook and YouTube channels. These include the Royal Ballet performing Peter and the Wolf and, on 17 April, The Metamorphosis, a surreal and very gloopy staging of Kafka\u2019s novella, choreographed by Arthur Pita and created for dancer Edward Watson.\nSelf-isolation will offer many an opportunity to binge on box sets. But if you\u2019re wary of committing to Game of Thrones (watching every episode non-stop would amount to three days) then \n starring Arya Stark herself, Maisie Williams. It\u2019s a two-hander, also featuring Zach Wyatt, appropriately exploring isolation and also hymning the wisdom of Walt Whitman. Written by the US playwright Lauren Gunderson, the production was filmed at Hampstead theatre in 2018. It\u2019s available for a week from 23 March.\nActivist and comedian Mark Thomas took the temperature of our healthcare system in his urgent 2018 solo show. You can \n if you make a donation to the Trussell Trust, which provides emergency food and support to those in need. \u201cYou know the score,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s always those with the least who need most help especially in times of crisis.\u201d\nYou have to hunt to find full theatre productions for very young audiences online so here\u2019s a little treat: to mark \n on 20 March the lovely Egg in Bath has released their wintry 40-minute tale for the under-fours.\nTravel restrictions needn\u2019t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris\u2019s esteemed Od\u00e9on has released its 2018 production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe and St\u00e9phane Braunschweig directs. English subtitles available, \n.\nThe actor \n has set up a reading group for professional and amateur actors to perform Shakespeare\u2019s complete plays in the order they\u2019re believed to have been written. The first livestreamed reading, on YouTube, was \n.\nAfter more than 1,000 productions, the Showstoppers improv crew are some of the quickest wits in the biz. So it\u2019s no surprise that when they were faced with a West End closure they live-streamed a performance. Watch their custom-made, never-to-be-repeated impro musical \n.\nTwenty actors performed new monologues written just for them in this new initiative, \n. There\u2019s some top talent involved, including comedian David Cross, actors Rachel Dratch and Andre Royo, and writers David Lindsay-Abaire, Stephen Adly Guirgis and Monique Moses.\nThe brilliant \n turned 20 this year and are best known in the UK for performing at London international mime festival and their trilogy comprising Mother, Father and Child. Their brand of domestic terror, hope and ennui will strike a chord at this troubling time: \n (Le Jardin, Le Salon and Le Sous Sol) online.\n was due to present a Trans Take Over at London\u2019s Bunker theatre this month as part of its now suspended \n season. So they have \n about losing loved ones and finding your own voice.\nIs this the short-term future of theatremaking? Bubble, a play set entirely on Facebook, uses a cast of European actors who have never met in person, rehearsed over Skype and filmed on their cameras. Theatre Uncuts production, written by Beats playwright Kieran Hurley, is \n until 23 April.\nRosie Kay\u2019s extraordinary \n was staged in army drill halls around the UK but since its live stream is still available online, you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay\u2019s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences.\nJulian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame\u2019s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017 with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It\u2019s available to \n, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers.\nLondon\u2019s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey\u2019s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It\u2019s \n and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.\nThink dance on ice and you\u2019d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities but the Canadian troupe \n has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.\n is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including \n\u2019s Fringe First award-winning show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots.\nSelf-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo \u2013 an inspirational tutor if ever there was \u2013 whose one-man Broadway show Latin History for Morons is \n.\nOn Friday 27 March, to mark World Theatre Day, the Royal Court will \n of David Ireland\u2019s blistering play Cyprus Avenue, starring Stephen Rea as a Belfast loyalist who is convinced his baby granddaughter is Gerry Adams. The film mixes the drama shot at the Royal Court with location scenes of Belfast.\nTwo households, both alike in dignity \u2026 well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. \n.\nThis is cheating as it\u2019s a TV series but \n is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It\u2019s based on Michael Patrick\u2019s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle \u201c\n\u201d. Wince.\nLove dance? Need to exercise at home? Then join the queen of Belgian avant-garde performance Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as she \n how to perform her 1983 classic Rosas Danst Rosas.

This is the tale of a small French-Algerian town cut off from the outside world after an outbreak of bubonic plague, which its citizens at first refuse to believe is a serious threat. The central character, a doctor, remarks that his fellow townspeople in this respect \u201cwere like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn\u2019t a thing made to man\u2019s measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away.\u201d\nLong celebrated as a masterful allegory of Nazi occupation, The Plague is also a story of qualified hope, as a kind of existential solidarity persists while the storm rages outside. Some British listeners might, however, find themselves irritated by the American-accented narration in the only audiobook edition, which has a certain amount of trouble with the French names, and opt instead for Daniel Defoe\u2019s grisly yet also undespairing \n (1722), as narrated in the reassuringly Beebish tones of Andrew Cullum.\nA more purely escapist experience might be the great epic of comfortable society in France. If there is an ultra-endurance champion among audiobook readers, it must be the late actor Neville Jason, who recorded every single word (there are more than a million) of Proust\u2019s great novel sequence, \n (or, in the Scott Moncrieff translation used for the audiobook, originally Remembrance of Things Past). It runs to 150 hours, or a bit less than a couple of hours every day for 12 weeks. At one point in the third volume, Proust\u2019s narrator remarks: \u201cIt is illness that makes us recognise that we do not live in isolation but are chained to a being from a different realm, worlds apart from us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body.\u201d\nThe vagaries of this being from a different realm are the subject of Bill Bryson\u2019s most recent book, narrated with his usual charm by the author himself. \n is ideal for the audio format, being a warm and engaging tour through the amazing facts of human physiology, with plenty of \u201cdid you know?\u201d moments to keep the household entertained. Did you know, for example, that scientists have determined that scratching your back gives the most long-lasting relief, but scratching your ankle brings the most pleasure?\nThe more you learn about your body, the more of a miracle it seems, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one that is still more or less in working order, even if no pandemic is raging. At one point Bryson, who throughout assumes a rather portly audience, exhorts you to \u201cget up and move around a little\u201d. This is rather difficult if one is reading, and wants to continue reading, the print version, but it\u2019s fine advice for the shut-in listener.\nMore purely escapist comfort listening is the classic BBC dramatisation of all of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s classic \n: nowadays the \n represents a simpler, even cosier time in the popular imagination, and Smiley himself, an owlish wanderer through the world\u2019s shades of grey, represents in some ways the kind of prime minister we are not allowed to have any more. He is played in this \u201cfull-cast audiobook\u201d (jargon for, essentially, a repackaged radio drama) by the great Simon Russell Beale.\nAnd if that still proves a little too this-worldly, there are more fantastical options. Those who like their medieval fantasy nonsense with a side order of sarcastic wit and catchy songs will have been bereft once they\u2019d finished bingeing on the first season of The Witcher, starring as the grey-ponytailed monster hunter. A diversion for the ears while fans wait for the second TV series are the audiobooks of the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. They begin with the gloriously titled \n, which may recall the deathless comment of literary scholar Hugo Dyson, who was one of the \u201cInklings\u201d to whom Tolkien used to read instalments of Lord of the Rings. On one such occasion, Dyson is said to have groaned: \u201cOh fuck, not another elf.\u201d\nA serene attitude towards the undesired appearance of elves, as well as towards much else, was cultivated by the great Stoics of classical times, among them the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. His \n, read in suitably imperial manner by Duncan Steen, are more authentically inspiring than any modern \u201cinspirational\u201d memes \u2013 and often quite funny. \u201cThe object of life is not to be on the side of the majority,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut to avoid finding oneself among the ranks of the insane.\u201d And remember: \u201cThe art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.\u201d\nIf, as a kind of exercise in meditating upon how things could be even worse, you wish to catch up on the latest expert thinking about alternative apocalypses, there is Stuart Russell\u2019s excellent \n, read by Raphael Corkhill. Russell, a pioneer in machine intelligence, here considers the increasingly fashionable subject of what to do if a superintelligent \n is created and then takes over the world \u2013 or rather, how to stop that from happening.\nHe provides a vivid and clear history of computing, and explains the problems inherent in trying to \u201cload\u201d values into AI so as to prevent it from trying to destroy us. He concludes that trying to give it any values at all is a mug\u2019s game. Instead, the AI should be taught a humble attention to humans\u2019 wishes. Particularly apt at the moment, when Facebook is \n while blithely enabling \n, is Russell\u2019s argument that we all have an inalienable right \u201cto live in a largely true information environment\u201d, the draconian enforcement of which cannot come soon enough.\nA celebrity reader, meanwhile, is often a powerful draw for an audiobook. Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian \n is available in editions read by Claire Danes or Elisabeth Moss, star of the TV series, while none other than Meryl Streep has recorded Nora Ephron\u2019s \n. And in case you have never got through, or started, \n, perhaps the existence of an audiobook of the Robert Fagles translation, read by Ian McKellen, will finally render the prospect irresistible.\nMost authors are not the ideal readers of their own work \u2013 and why should they be? Writing prose and being able to read aloud in such a way as to hold a listener\u2019s attention are two entirely different skills that happen to coexist in one person only by pure coincidence. One delightful such coincidence is novelist Anne Enright, whose performance of her own widely admired new novel, \n, brings out all the mischievous empathy of her writing. Perhaps it is something to do with being Irish, because Marian Keyes also reads her new book, \n, with a nicely understated wit.\nIn a way, David Cameron is also the ideal reader of his own work, if only because you would feel sorry for anyone else who had to do it. For some light comic relief, it is possible to listen to the architect of Britain\u2019s last disaster before the present one reading his own memoir, imaginatively entitled \n, as though carefully holding a quail\u2019s egg in his mouth while insisting that the Brexit referendum he didn\u2019t have to call was \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cinevitable\u201d. From the somewhat rustic ambience of the recording, one may happily imagine him narrating it from \n, the kind of civilised retreat to which we might all wish we now had access.\n \n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4ca8da07edfe63395aab75d2583d5e21f6d669c/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9fd37155aafc323541e6f55131598ce"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2020/mar/25/lockdown-tv-which-show-would-you-like-to-rewatch-with-us": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2020/mar/25/lockdown-tv-which-show-would-you-like-to-rewatch-with-us", "title": "Lockdown TV: Which show would you like to rewatch with us?", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:36:33 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the coronavirus pandemic stops us from enjoying our favourites with our friends and family, come watch a classic from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 with us<br></p><p>Long gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain.

So I decided to start thinking up easy games that I could enjoy, too. I could fully engage with the kids while we played, and then allow them to play independently afterwards, knowing I had done my bit for a while.\nI have just one rule for every single game we play: always let the kids come to the game. If they come, great. If they don\u2019t? Leave the activity out if you can. They might approach it later. They might not. It doesn\u2019t matter.\nIn April 2018, I set up \n, sharing activities that used stuff from around the house. I now have more than 150 games on my website and in my book, including the selection below, and I will be using them to get through the weeks and months ahead. Along with the chocolate, of course.\nI love dice. There are so many games you can play with them, and counting the dots from one to six is such a great early skill. This game came to me right when the kids were driving me bonkers and I was fed up with muttering \u201cFFS\u201d to myself.\nA load of books or cushions (about 25)\nA length of string (or more if you want more snakes)\nMasking tape\nA dice\n1. Scatter the books or cushions across a room in a rough, wiggly line \u2013 these are your board-game squares.\n2. Between two of your squares, lay down a wiggly line of string \u2013 this is your snake. You can have one or more snakes.\n3. Between another two squares, stick down some masking tape \u2013 this is your ladder. It doesn\u2019t have to look like a ladder; it can be just a line. But you can make rungs, if you\u2019re feeling fancy. Again, you can have one or more ladders.\n1. Err ... it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. Just take it in turns to throw the dice and jump across the corresponding number of board squares. (You are the counters!)\n2. If you land on a snake, you go back to the square at the end of the snake.\n3. If you land on a ladder, you go forward to the square at the top of the ladder.\n4. The first player to reach the finishing line wins.\nFor those learning to read, add some additional squares with bits of paper that say things such as \u201cHop 5 times\u201d or \u201cGo back 3 steps\u201d.\nGiant cardboard boxes are the best. You can quite literally throw one in the direction of small children and go and make a cup of tea. Once they have run out of things to do with it, cut it down and lay it flat and you have got yourself an instant racetrack.\nA large cardboard box\nA pen\nA toy car for each player\n1. Write your child\u2019s name in the style of a road along the flattened-out box.\n2. Leave the cars nearby.\n1. Each player chooses a car and drives it along the letter roads. Tell your child the letters you are driving along. See if they want to join in.\n2. You could also write your name alongside your child\u2019s and have a race.\n3. Or perhaps try taping a pen to the back of your child\u2019s car, then see if they can draw around the racetrack with it.\nIf you don\u2019t have a box, an old wallpaper roll works well.\nThis is probably my most popular game; it seems to set the kids\u2019 imaginations running wild \u2013 the way playtime should. Plus, it gets them to practise writing numbers without realising that\u2019s what they are doing. You will need quite a few bits and bobs for this one, but hopefully it\u2019s stuff you already have at home.\nA small toy your child likes \u2013 we use Dennis the Dinosaur\nA little basket or box\nPlay-dough or Blu-Tack\n3 differently shaped keys\nA pencil and some paper\nA dice\n1. Put the toy under the upside-down basket or box.\n2. Make three balls out of the play-dough or Blu-Tack, then press a key into each one to make an impression. Put the three key impressions on top of the basket or box.\n3. At the top of one bit of paper, trace round one of the keys with the pencil. Draw three boxes below it. Then repeat for the remaining two keys.\n4. Leave the dice near the basket or box.\n5. Finally, hide the keys around the room.\n1. Tell your child that their toy has been trapped inside a cage and they need to set the toy free. In order to do this, they have to find the keys to the cage \u2013 and the keys are hidden somewhere in the room.\n2. When they find a key, they must match the key to its outline on one of the bits of paper. Let them find the correct bit of paper by matching the key shape.\n3. Before they can use the key to unlock the cage, they must roll three numbers on the dice to get the code. They then write the code on the piece of paper. Let them roll the dice, recognise the number and write it in a box.\n4. Once they have written down the complete code, they can put the key in its play-dough impression.\n5. Repeat with the remaining two keys.\n6. When they complete the third key, the cage is unlocked and the toy is released. They will also have written out nine numbers, and hopefully laughed their little socks off.\nMy hen do was full of brilliant games, including \u201cprosecco pong\u201d, which ended with everyone crying with laughter. When I arrived home in a bedraggled state, I discovered a ping-pong ball in my handbag and I thought the kids might like a go, minus the prosecco.\nSome cups\nA pen and some paper\nScissors\nA ping-pong ball or bouncy ball\n1. Pop the cups on the floor. They can be dotted about randomly, in a line or in a triangle.\n2. Write on a piece of paper something you would like your child to practise, then cut it out and put it in a cup. For example, if they are learning particular letters or numbers, write them down. Do this for all the cups.\n3. Put the ball nearby.\n1. Explain to your little one that the idea is to bounce the ball and try to get it to land in one of the cups. (Take turns if you are playing with more than one child.)\n2. When a player gets the ball into a cup, they can take out the bit of paper and see what it is. Help them to read it out loud, then remove that cup.\n3. Keep playing until all the cups are gone.\nTo practise colour recognition, use different coloured cups or put different-coloured items inside each cup. This is good for ages one to three.\nIn my experience, simple is always best. If my kids and I can play a game with just a pen and paper, it makes my day. No big clean-up and I get five minutes of feeling that I am nailing parenting because my kids have the biggest grins on their faces. Whenever I hear them say: \u201cCan we play it again?\u201d, it\u2019s music to my ears! (Well, not always, but, you know, if I\u2019m in the mood for it.) And speaking of music \u2026\n10 bits of paper\nA pen\nSomething to play music on\n1. On each piece of paper, write a different letter. It could be the letters of your child\u2019s name, phonics sounds or even words. I tend to mix it up, including a few letters my kids are confident with and a few that are new or that they get stuck on.\n2. Spread the letters out on the floor.\n3. Put the music on standby.\n1. Explain that when the music plays, they can dance or run around between the letters. Then, when the music stops, they have to jump on a letter and shout it out. You jump on a letter, too, and shout it out.\n2. Remove the letters that get jumped on, then start the music again.\n3. Keep going until there is only one letter left to win, or until all the letters are gone.\nIf you want to make things more competitive, stop the music and shout out a letter for children to find \u2013 and race them to it.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0ddec44d500c30ffcbf0acf686ffbc45dbb38c/0_0_5152_3435/master/5152.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=87627ee4ad0ee41e0da26a8924f5bcf5"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/25/the-best-online-art-galleries-adrian-searle": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/25/the-best-online-art-galleries-adrian-searle", "title": "Private view: our art critic's favourite online galleries", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:00:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>The world\u2019s great art museums have closed their doors \u2013 but you can travel within their walls virtually to see treasures up close</p><p>Two weeks ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/10/andy-warhol-review-tate-modern-london\">Andy Warhol</a> opened at Tate Modern, then closed again.

Nevertheless, a bit of rapture or ecstasy wouldn\u2019t go amiss for any of us.\nEven if it isn\u2019t quite the physical thing, there is always art. Armchair tours of the world\u2019s museums, now that we can\u2019t go anywhere, will have to do. The experience is in some ways far from second best. Have you ever tried muscling your way through the crowds gathered in front of \n? Mostly, they are letting their smart phones do the watching.\nYou can home right in or back away, without bumping into anyone. If you want to get closer still, the Night Watch is being restored, \n (there is even an accompanying children\u2019s tour). The Rijkmuseum, along with more than a thousand other museums worldwide, is now partnering with \n, where you can get inside everywhere from MoMA in New York to the Munch Museum in Oslo, from the British Museum to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris to the Today Art Museum in Beijing. Not only that, the website also allows you to zoom in far closer on individual works than you ever could in real life. Like a dragonfly, you can alight on Monet\u2019s pond, lose yourself in the sky beyond the branches in a C\u00e9zanne landscape, or get personal with the ruffs and jerkins, the bulbous noses and elephant eyes of the Night Watch.\nFancy\n and its 936 Goyas, some of which come with extensive commentaries and videos (with English subtitles). The same approach is applied to Vel\u00e1zquez, Bosch, Rogier van der Weyden and the other artists in what is my favourite museum, and you can spend days on the Prado website, just as you can in the museum, and fall down the rabbit hole of its \n. At \n you can take a virtual tour of the empty galleries, zooming in on artworks as you go.\nThe \nhas announced has a number of online exhibitions on view \u2013 including Michelangelo, and another on the history and development of the Bauhaus, as well as its extensive collection and art historical resources. Who knows where even an idle journey might take you.\nEvery day, more and more institutions are upping their game in the light of our current situation. Congolese choreographer and dancer Faustin Linyekula was meant to perform at this year\u2019s BMW \n, alongside other performances by Okwui Okpokwasili and Tanya Lukin Linklater. Linyekula and his collaborators worked with Tate to stage a one-off, site-specific work, \n in the empty Tanks.\nHauser & Wirth\u2019s new digital programme Dispatches, a series of original video and online features and events, launched a few days ago. Last weekend, \n a live Instagram gig \n, and in From a Distance, gallery artists are to share filmed messages and studio visits, beginning with Avery Singer\u2019s Artist Studio Challenge, inviting artists to show their works in progress, and Guillermo Kuitca showcases his home studio and drawings.

There are mixtapes, short films, and a track of the day. In its first offering they also link about 900 ICA talks from 1982-1993, \n. All you need to do to get a daily email is \n.\nFor enlivening conversations with artists, I recommend \n. Based at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in Humlebaek, Denmark, its website is full of good, sometimes alarming, things. As well as poets, novelists, architects ad thinkers, artists discussing single works, artists talking about outer space and the Arctic, artists who use water in their work, writers on facing the blank page and a section devoted to advice to the young. Whether you want to watch David Hockney talking about space, Marina Abramovi\u0107 discussing Giacometti, painters winding each other up or just terrific conversations, this is a very good place to find yourself.\nWhile you are at the Louisiana Channel you can also find conceptual poet \n performing \n poetry reading. Goldsmith is founding editor of \n, a cornucopia of sometimes arcane and historical delights. I have been dipping in and out of this essential resource for years, with its old radio conversations and interviews, the punk rock of Martin Kippenberger and pop songs by Joseph Beuys, readings by John Ashbery and Roni Horn, a huge reservoir artists\u2019 films and videos, from Bruce Nauman to Agn\u00e9s Varda, John Akomfrah to Martha Rosler. I have barely scratched the surface.\nFor more instant delights, the Instagram feeds of \n and \n are worth a follow. Rawsthorn writes about design (what she really focuses on is the material pleasures and strangeness of the world, design is just a way in) while Ellcock, who is described as \u201can image hunter and social media art curator\u201d, posts the most astonishing images.

An unlikely scenario, but it will make your under-stairs cupboard feel positively capacious by comparison.\nChiming horribly with our present predicament, \n\u2019s 1995 masterpiece isolates Julianne Moore\u2019s frail, privileged homemaker in a bubble of her own paranoia and anxiety, brought on by an ever-expanding palette of allergies. Does her affliction come from within? Is she curing herself or making things worse? We can all relate to the uncertainty.\nWho needs the outdoors anyway? It\u2019s not so great for James Franco\u2019s carefree climber dude when he becomes stuck between a rock and a messy self-amputation on a solo canyon-jumping jaunt. Staying at home never looked so sensible. Or leaving a note saying where you\u2019re going.\nShould we airbrush Repulsion from history because it was directed by \n?

But then you remember how it worked out for Jack Nicholson and family at the Overlook Hotel.

That concrete security room seemed like an expensive extra but it sure comes in handy. The cat-and-mouse games are somewhat predictable, but David Fincher proves he can do his swoopy camerawork even in small spaces.\nCorny and creaky it may be, but the 1960 Disney adventure shows a shipwrecked family cheerily working together to make their desert island a happy makeshift home.

Informed by director Deniz Gamze Erguven\u2019s own experience, it\u2019s a rousing mix of social critique, escape thriller and modern-day fairytale.\nAs its maker Robert Eggers put it: \u201cNothing good can happen when two men are left alone in a giant phallus.\u201d We feel like we\u2019re stuck inside this retro hallucination with them, caught in the crossfire as salty sea dogs Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson work, drink, fight and wank themselves into a florid, frenzied masculine face-off. Thank God for GPS.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to live here forever,\u201d purrs the creepy estate agent as he shows Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots round an eerily generic starter home. They don\u2019t have a choice: all escape attempts lead back to their front door in this sharp little sci-fi \u2013 somewhere between Groundhog Day, The Truman Show and, most chillingly of all, everyday domesticity. (Released on digital platforms and DVD on 27 March.)\nKatharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart are hardly a match made on Guardian Soulmates, but what doesn\u2019t kill them (disease, rapids, nature, Germans) makes their bond stronger in this classic river adventure. When you\u2019re stranded together in adverse circumstances, you make the best of it.\nIn which Joanna Hogg illustrates how a couple can live together yet apart. Her elegant, mysterious film is set almost entirely within the confines of a modernist London home. It is both a prison and a sanctuary for artist couple Viv Albertine and Liam Gillick, whose marriage has arrived at some sort of crisis point. Albertine at least finds a creative outlet for her alienation and frustration.\nAfter a lavish dinner party, the guests (bourgeois, charmless, indiscreet) find themselves unable to leave the room for some reason. The servants have gone, supplies are dwindling, the veneer of civility peels away as hours become days. Surrealist mischief-maker Luis Bu\u00f1uel gives no answers or explanations. His savage satire still cuts deep.\nAny \u201ccabin in the woods\u201d movie could apply, but Eli Roth\u2019s 2002 entry both reinvigorates the subgenre and deals specifically with a virus \u2013 a flesh-eating one many times more aggressive than Covid-19. Savour the gory spectacle of teens making dumb, cruel and selfish decisions, and consider this a lesson in how not to do it.\nSaturday detention feels like an eternity when you\u2019re a teenager, which doesn\u2019t bode well for an extended quarantine, but at least these misfits leave in a better state than when they went in. From today\u2019s social media-saturated perspective, John Hughes\u2019s cult chamber piece feels like an argument for just sitting down and talking to each other.\nSpare a thought for Claire Denis\u2019s crew in this elegantly doomy sci-fi, and be grateful you\u2019re not trapped in a shipful of convicts and rapists, consigned to an interstellar suicide mission, or being experimented on by an unhinged fertility scientist. \n there\u2019s a queue for the masturbation chamber. Then again, for many, there are fates worse than being locked in a spaceship with Robert Pattinson.\nLeft for dead on the red planet, Matt Damon\u2019s stranded Nasa scientist is surely the loneliest person in movie history, but does he sit around and mope? No, he gets busy \n a way to survive. Added to which, he\u2019s got friends, who disobey orders and turn back to rescue him \u2013 with a little help, let\u2019s not forget, from the Chinese.\nBefore escape rooms, we had to make do with this ingeniously bizarre sci-fi, in which a group of strangers find themselves locked in a labyrinth of cubical rooms, most of which want to kill them. Seen in the right light, it\u2019s a testament to cooperation, resourcefulness and binge-watching The Crystal Maze.\nIt literally takes a village in this bracing Brazilian neo-western, though guns and hallucinogens also help. Cut off from the rest of the country, threatened by corrupt politicians and ruthless American mercenaries, a harmonious, indigenous community bands together to preserve their identity and protect what\u2019s theirs.\nAny form of confinement will feel like liberty compared to the plight of Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric), trapped inside his own body after a stroke and paralysed save for one eye. Out of this unimaginable, almost unfilmable situation, Bauby undertakes a heroic inner journey (that resulted in the memoir of the title), and director Julian Schnabel crafts a gorgeous film free of schmaltz and full of hope.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fb7899d4662e04a314e5ef5c32063bb0c2373b/0_199_2733_1640/master/2733.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a40841ec561d3ebeb6e0081d78c84212"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/the-fall-where-to-start-with-their-catalogue": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/the-fall-where-to-start-with-their-catalogue", "title": "The Fall: where to start in their back catalogue", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 11:03:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our Listener\u2019s Digest series continues, guiding you through the key moments in the 31-studio album discography of Mark E Smith\u2019s post-punk band</p><p><strong>Hex Enduction Hour (1982)</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/the-fall-where-to-start-with-their-catalogue\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "\u2018There\u2019s always some cunt who wants to ask me about a masterpiece I made in 1982,\u201d frothed \n to Q in 2015. Yet back in 82, the frontman of the fecund Salford post-punk outfit titled the band\u2019s fourth studio album to be an induction into their world; to place listeners under their spell. While previous albums had ranged from amphetamine-charged rockabilly to deconstructed avant-punk, Smith knew the band had stumbled into new terrain here \u2013 deeming it a year zero moment.\nThe beginning of the band\u2019s double-drummer period was one such key evolution, with Karl Burns and Paul Hanley crashing into and around one another with deftness and discordance. Smith claims he instructed the band to play out of time, to distort thinking around conventional musical structures, and the result is an album that exists in a constant state of push-pull dynamism.\nWith recording taking place between a disused cinema in Hertfordshire and a studio normally used for folk music in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, there\u2019s a deliberate lo-fidelity quality, an antithetical statement to the increasingly slick production techniques of the day. The album ricochets between moments of crisp hyper-tautness to frenzied, unravelling laxity. Tonally, it\u2019s raw and serrated, with Steve Hanley\u2019s corkscrewing bass lines as twisting and piercing as Smith\u2019s venomous and intractable vocals. It\u2019s the sound of a band consumed by momentum and driven by an obdurate vision \u2013 but nonplussed by imperfections that arise along the way. Tracks such as \n and \n are considered, but move in such gloriously erratic bursts that they could be based on the musical pattern you\u2019d get from hurling a piano down a flight of stairs.\nLyrically, it\u2019s as surreal as it is sniping and satirical, with Smith exhausted by the \u201cshit of the times\u201d such as \u201cbland bastards like \n and Spandau Ballet\u201d, claiming he\u2019d \u201crather listen to the Polish builders clanking away next door than any of that crap\u201d. Almost 40 years on, it retains that all-or-nothing spirit, losing none of its unrelenting charge while occasionally sounding just like builders clanking away next door. Smith\u2019s supposedly ironic use of a racial epithet on The Classical has dated far worse, and stands out more than ever as a regrettable blip on an otherwise unspoiled album.\nThe story goes that when John Peel heard album opener \n for the first time, he fainted and had to be resuscitated. The urgent, incessant, yet strangely buoyant bassline that runs through it is certainly one that rattles around the head to dizzying degrees. \n, meanwhile, finds Smith spouting obliquely as the band build, creep and crash around him during a nine-minute album opus of jagged, slow-burn post-punk. It\u2019s a record filled with such snap-and-release moments \u2013 surging eruptions springing from highly coiled restraint \u2013 such as the expulsions of Smile, with Smith yelping like a feral creature.\nOne of the Fall\u2019s more melodic offerings, a position commonly attributed to the contributions of Smith\u2019s then-wife \n. The slimming down to one drummer again leaves more focus for the spiralling dual guitars of Craig Scanlon and Smith Start, which weave between infectious melody and the band\u2019s more typically gritty and sinewy tone. Trackssuch as \n are the kind of thing you might hear on an Elastica record 10 years later, such is the gleaming melody and shimmering guitar work. However, Smith still finds room for more typically esoteric territory via the rattling and shrieking homage to one of his favourite bands, \n, via \n.\n\u201cI was in the realm of the essence of Tong,\u201d intones Smith on \n \u2013 with such a wry delivery it suggests he\u2019s only just got over laughing his way through his previous lines (reading out a list of DJ Pete Tong\u2019s life essentials). However, while Smith\u2019s humorously vituperative lyrics were not something new, the musical backdrop to the song \u2013 all crackling electronics and crunchy beats \u2013 captured a new direction. \n even dips into throbbing industrial territory, while on the lyrics to Octo Realm/Ketamine Sun \u2013 a strangely poignant track that nods to \n \u2013 Smith even seems to reference the band\u2019s new experimentations. \u201cI\u2019m smartass at the computer / you kids are making queerer sounds.\u201d Then again, he also says: \u201cYou\u2019re a walking tower of Adidas crap at a cobblers four times a month,\u201d so who knows?\nA collaboration between Smith and the German electronic duo Mouse on Mars. It\u2019s a fun, loose record stuffed with twisting and vibrating electronics that shifts tonally from pop-heavy melodies to erratic heavy clangs, as \n from gargled snarl to smoothed-out croon. Ironically \u2013 given James Murphy\u2019s unashamed mimicry of the Fall \u2013 there\u2019s more than a whiff of LCD Soundsystem to this one-off album.\nStraight from the man himself, via the helping hand of Austin Collings, this is as full of laughs as it bile and bitterness. Smith\u2019s recollections of life in the Fall are often at odds with other members\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t detract from this being a riot of a read.\nFamed for having 60+members over the years, \n decided to go on a life-consuming odyssey to track them all down and hear their stories.\nAs the band\u2019s longest-serving member, Steve Hanley is the only person who can offer almost 20 years of insight into the chaos that is life in the Fall.\nFor Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, \n.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite Fall album?

Be. Queen!\u201d)\nTwenty-seven years have elapsed between my 12th birthday and the start of this year. How would the film bear up? Going in, I already cannot think what appeal it could have had back then. Most of the movie centres on Anne Boleyn\u2019s famous \n of the monarch over a number of years \u2013 all of this is a bit silly, but kind of fun \u2013 and then it flounders terribly when it has to do the Reformation, with Cromwell and Wolsey reduced to oily figures gliding in and out of shadows in any number of tapestry-bedecked antechambers.\nThe film begins with a prologue in which Henry \u2013 played by a desperately hungover-looking \n \u2013 is about to sign Anne\u2019s death warrant for treason. Thin piccolo music, blatantly studio-based scenery, drab camera movements, and the fact that the view out of the window is obviously a watercolour, conspire to give the film\u2019s opening a bit of a Blackadder vibe. In fact, scenes at court are often unfortunately reminiscent of Monty Python; every mop-haired, tunic-sporting courtier looks the spit of Michael Palin.\nThen we skip back to the early days of their courtship. Anne\u2019s hilarious spurning of a horny Henry is where most of the movie\u2019s fun is to be had. The film\u2019s script, drawing from Tudors for Simpletons 101, lays it on thick. Early on, a hunting mate asks: \u201cDare I ask, has your majesty ever been refused by a wench?\u201d He has not, but it isn\u2019t long before Burton is groaning through the booze-sweats: \u201cI think of nothing but you and me playing dog and bitch, of you and me playing horse and mare, of you and me in every way. I want to fill you up night after night.\u201d Oh love, we\u2019ve all been there. Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold, an Anne Boleyn of such exquisite alabaster beauty as to make Helena Bonham-Carter look like \n, is a spry counterpart to this hulking Henry. Her line readings are perhaps rather theatrical for modern tastes but like, say, drag performer Sharon Needles, this queen is fierce.\nYou\u2019ll have gathered that this is all rather sub-\n. At its best the film is a glossy Tudor-succession telenovela, with sublime, Oscar-winning costumes, and characters saying silly stuff such as: \u201cDivorce is like killing \u2013 after the first time it isn\u2019t so difficult.\u201d At its worst it\u2019s finicky, cardboard nonsense full of signet rings and fine pewter chalices that makes a whopping hash of history: it seems unlikely that Henry offed Thomas More purely as a bargaining chip with his wife for a spot of how\u2019s-your-father, or that Anne would have chosen death by beheading over the gift of a bijou pad in France. \n How much of this did I understand or enjoy at the time? Why did I watch it so much? (See above: there was next to nothing else.) Nothing ever really takes off in the movie, but at this stage of self-isolation anything goes; like comfort food, this trash fed a peckish part of my very worst movie-watching instincts, and I was grateful.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f9e41987475a5fd48331a1b87744fbb1107296/0_133_2720_1632/master/2720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ecb7efd8cbaf4e377ad7ef8acc85342b"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/24/what-to-watch-self-isolating-film-tv-youtube-tennis": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/24/what-to-watch-self-isolating-film-tv-youtube-tennis", "title": "What I'm really watching: old Parky, ancient tennis and a tiger cowboy", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:27:06 GMT", "summary": "<p>Self-isolation offers a chance to catch up on the classics \u2013 but that requires a calm it\u2019s currently hard to muster.

Happily, he seems to have liked it saying: \u201cThe only thing I really, really hate are the songs.\u201d\nNaturally, \n is partly to blame. If you take a random person who is exhausted, anxious and confused, and offer them a choice between watching a cherished classic from their childhood or the full seven hours of B\u00e9la Tarr\u2019s S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3, they\u2019ll most likely plump for the least forbidding option. Even so, I suspect that our current predicament has merely accelerated a trend. I used to be altogether more adventurous in my viewing habits. In my 20s and 30s I\u2019d always have gone for the B\u00e9la Tarr, if only to boast to people about how I was the sort of person who would always go for the B\u00e9la Tarr. Since then I\u2019ve been backsliding, or maybe lightening up. And, as of this past fortnight, I\u2019m a complete MOR sap. These days it\u2019s as much as I can do to focus on anything that a) I haven\u2019t already seen and b) comes in under two hours.\nWhat am I really watching? Mostly, I\u2019m opting for the lowest form of escapism. As a kind of comfort blanket, I\u2019ll watch YouTube videos of old celebrity interviews: John Lennon on Dick Cavett and Richard Burton on Parky.\nOccasionally I\u2019ll watch antique tennis matches, too. Wilander versus McEnroe at the 1985 US Open. Becker versus Lendl at the 1988 Masters.\nMostly these are matches I remember watching, live on telly, as a kid. Sometimes they are matches where I can remember which player hit which shot on which break point in the fifth set. Which makes it rather sad; perhaps a little creepy, too. But you don\u2019t need a psychiatrist to explain the appeal of these videos. There\u2019s something reassuring about watching a drama unfold and knowing how it ends.\nNext weekend, fingers crossed, we\u2019ll have another stab at the BFI list. But, for the time being, let\u2019s not beat ourselves up about taking the low road, about choosing the trashiest option or the nostalgic frippery. Whatever gets you through the night, as John Lennon once said, possibly to Dick Cavett. Besides, Call My Agent is holding up nicely on the second viewing, and the tiger zoo documentary is perfectly entertaining. (Although, wait, how many episodes? Surely that\u2019s stretching the whole thing very thin.) Plus there\u2019s always the second half of The Wizard of Oz still to get through.\nIn Preston Sturges\u2019s Depression-era satire \n, a successful director of Hollywood comedies dreams of making a harsh, social-realist masterpiece only to realise that the world desperately needs to laugh, particularly when it\u2019s laid out flat on its arse. That sounds about right; it\u2019s a solid thesis right now.\nSo by all means watch dark, difficult films during dark, difficult times. But maybe balance them out with something lighter as well. I like the story of how, after \n died, it was found that his film library contained VHS copies of \n, \n and Romancing the Stone. I like it because it shows another side to the man, and perhaps points the way to a deeper psychological truth. Sometimes even Bergman needed a break from Bergman.\n", "pic": null}, "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/soothing-songs-for-self-isolation-readers-picks": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/soothing-songs-for-self-isolation-readers-picks", "title": "Soothing songs for self-isolation: readers' picks", "published": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:28:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Whether it\u2019s Alice Coltrane or Brian Eno, 80s pop or lover\u2019s rock, here are your favourite songs to soothe the soul, collected in a playlist</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/from-aphex-twin-to-al-green-the-most-soothing-songs-to-self-isolate-with\">From Aphex Twin to Al Green: the most soothing songs to self-isolate with</a></li></ul><p>Last week, we published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/from-aphex-twin-to-al-green-the-most-soothing-songs-to-self-isolate-with\">a 60-song playlist of soothing songs</a> to reduce the stresses of self-isolation and the coronavirus outbreak.

But we \u2013 the die-hard EastEnders fans \n and the ill-fitting knitwear of Ian Beale \u2013 will for ever remember.\nIf now more than ever you need the distraction of an unrealistically well-stocked Minute Mart and the only caff in east London that does not sell flat whites, we have got you covered. True, there is only one \n, but with some careful curation, you can get your fix of soap-tropes elsewhere.\nDeath is an integral part of EastEnders; an outlandish or surprising death has become central to many of its special episodes (nothing says Christmas like a beloved character dying). Accidental deaths, deaths where someone gets their comeuppance \u2013 deaths from illness, murder, manslaughter, falling off a cliff (Janine and Barry, 2003) \u2013 you name it, they have covered it. But its piece-de-resistance death is the false death, usually one intentionally faked.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an elaborately faked death (and I don\u2019t just mean the simple \u201care they dead or not?\u201d plot device or cliffhanger) you have plenty of shows to choose from. There is Orphan Black (Netflix, BBC America), Homeland (Amazon Prime), Pretty Little Liars (Netflix) and, of course, Game of Thrones (Now TV), which, for a show that isn\u2019t a soap, is dominated by feuding families and unwanted pregnancies.\nFor spoiler reasons I can\u2019t tell you the details of these fake death, but they are abundant in many shows. Hint: you can even find them in comedies (see: Community, 4oD).\nThe recurring EastEnders character Max Branning is the perfect example of a guy who somehow gets credit for doing the bare minimum in family and friendship. We are primed as viewers to feel sympathy for him on the rare occasions he is not conning, sleazing or flogging dodgy cars \u2013 yet he continues to punch above his weight with the (often much younger) women of EastEnders.\nWhat is it about this human baked bean that is so irresistible to women? It might be one of the soaps\u2019 most unrealistic bits of writing (and they once had a vicar who murdered people), but it sure as hell makes for irresistible watching. If you get a thrill out of the love tangles of the truly awful, why not kick things off with a Woody Allen movie before binge watching Curb Your Enthusiasm (NowTV); Big Bang Theory (a classic in the \u201cnerd gets hot girl\u201d theme, Netflix) or Modern Family (includes older monosyllabic bore with beautiful young wife, Amazon Prime). Don\u2019t worry, all of these shows poke fun at this awful trope.\nRecent watchers of EastEnders will notice that Whitney Dean has joined the long lineage of characters who have spent time in prison. Crime and policing features heavily on the show, delivering closure to storylines or opening up new ones focused on miscarriages of justice.\nIf you need your prison fix, you could do much \n, the ensemble prison show set in a women\u2019s prison. For something more serious try Locked Up (Netflix), a much darker Spanish drama once more looking at women\u2019s prison. And there are plenty of excellent documentaries to choose from: Inside the World\u2019s Toughest Prisons (Netflix) is a series hosted by Raphael Rowe, who \n, and far surpasses similar offerings fronted by EastEnders hard man Ross Kemp.\nAnd while no police officer could be quite as incompetent as DCI Marsden \u2013 the EastEnders detective who after 20 years still cannot catch Phil Mitchell and has yet to launch an investigation into why so many Albert Square dead people aren\u2019t actually deceased \u2013 there are a number of bingeable series that deal with ongoing police grudges and incompetence. See Making a Murderer (Netflix) and Keeping Faith (BBC).\nEastenders loves a mystery \u2013 mainly of the whodunnit variety, although parentage questions always thrill (see the now iconic \nYou aint\u2019 my muvva\u201d / \u201cYes I am!\u201d moment between \n). But there is one more recurring mystery: how do any of the market traders manage to afford London rent?\nIdealised small businesses are a common theme of television shows (Fleabag riffed beautifully off this with its eye-watering pricing in the cafe) and EastEnders is one of the worst. It has tried in recent years to better reflect reality: it is now more than \u00a36 for a bacon bap and a cup of tea in the caff; the Queen Vic has finally conceded it needs to sell food; Kim realised she would make more money selling the B&B as a property then she ever could running it.\nFamily Business (Netflix), a comedy-drama from France, follows a Parisian family attempting to transform its failing kosher butcher into a legal weed cafe; cult comedy Schitt\u2019s Creek (Netflix) follows a wealthy family forced into financial ruin and exile to a backwater US town, where they run a motel. The drama Bloodline (Netflix) follows a Florida resort and, like EastEnders, is full of lies and festering family traumas. Then there is the animated series Bob\u2019s Burgers (Amazon Prime), set in a burger joint, while for something altogether surreal there\u2019s SpongeBob SquarePants. It features the Krusty Krab, a diner under the sea that inspired a real restaurant in Ramallah, on the West Bank.\nFor all the stick that EastEnders gets, it continues to attract millions of viewers across the nation, cutting across demographics and breaking through cultural silos. Many storylines are fearless in tackling difficult or sensitive topics, introducing wholly new perspectives to groups who might otherwise not come across them. There has been a trans character, a convert to Islam, characters on zero-hour contracts and families dealing with knife crime, police harassment and the threat of homelessness. Other plotlines explore consent, mental health and euthanasia. Crucially, it is one of the few shows that has characters who are hard up for cash. If you are skint, you are often invisible in Britain, despite struggling for money being a reality for many, many peoplein the country.\nIf you are interested in shows that deal with the lives of marginal groups, there\u2019s Pose (BBC), which \n and features the largest ever cast of trans actors; My Mad Fat Diary (4oD), \n; Top Boy (Netflix), which looks at drug dealing and gang feuds; and Sex Education (Netflix), a joyful exploration of sexual identity well beyond heterosexuality.\nBut, if you want to see portrayals of how Britain\u2019s working poor are living today, you will have to settle for the news.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35205e6fcea5c72a96f59aebfad1ea48245bb1e/0_42_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9760283c41813aa7b017f7f5a767b6d9"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/peter-wyngarde-memorabilia-up-for-auction": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/peter-wyngarde-memorabilia-up-for-auction", "title": "Peter Wyngarde memorabilia snapped up at auction", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:35:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Snakeskin jacket among items belonging to cult star who played Jason King from 1969</p><p>A snakeskin jacket, silk kaftan smoking gown and chunky golden rings once sported by the fictional television writer turned sleuth Jason King have been sold at auction.</p><p>The items were among a trove of memorabilia that belonged to the late cult star Peter Wyngarde, who played the bushily moustached King from 1969 to 1971.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/peter-wyngarde-memorabilia-up-for-auction\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "A snakeskin jacket, silk kaftan smoking gown and chunky golden rings once sported by the fictional television writer turned sleuth Jason King have been sold at auction.\nThe items were among a trove of memorabilia that belonged to the late cult star \n, who played the bushily moustached King from 1969 to 1971.\nIn 1970 Wyngarde was declared Britain\u2019s best-dressed male personality and new parents across the nation named their children Jason after his character.

The song in question, I Will Surrender, comes with the note: \u201cWords and music by Robin Gibb, 1970.\u201d \nWyngarde went on to play the chief of the secret police, Klytus, in the 1980 movie Flash Gordon, and the silk neckscarf he wore at the New York premiere was up for sale, as was a guitar apparently signed by Freddie Mercury. Queen performed the film\u2019s title track.\nBy the time he appeared in Flash Gordon, Wyngarde had been through difficult times. In 1975, he was \n in a bus station toilet. Newspapers reported that he was summoned under his real name of Cyril Louis Goldbert. A tabloid later reported that his mop of hair was thinning and covered in a flat cap.\nPoignantly, an \u201coriginal vintage Ray Marston Wig Studio-made wig/toupee\u201d was on sale. The catalogue said: \u201cThe toupee of usual form, with a fine mesh base. Supplied within its original box, addressed to Wyngarde at his personal residence.

On continental Europe, some 80% of an orchestra\u2019s income comes from public subsidy, so even in the absence of live concerts, government grants should help to keep these ensembles alive. In the US, where funding is driven by philanthropy and tax breaks, musical groups should also be able to weather this storm \u2013 so long as the donors keep donating. But in the UK, the mixed-economy funding model means that orchestras are highly reliant on earned income.\n\u201cThe average level of public funding across my sector is about 30%,\u201d explains Pemberton. \u201cBut a lot of ABO members get none at all. They have to duck and dive to earn a living. There are an awful lot of those orchestras for whom touring is their lifeblood. They need international touring alongside UK concerts. If that income is totally shut off they are in a very dangerous position.\u201d\n\u201cIt breaks my heart to say it but I think a lot of musicians are going to be forced out of the profession if the government doesn\u2019t step in and support them properly,\u201d says Trubridge. \u201cThis is a \u00a35.2bn business for the UK economy and the government seems to have just turned its back on the freelance workers within it who create all the wonderful product.\u201d\nMost organisations are doing their best to pay fees for bookings made up to 28 days ahead, and some are going beyond that, if they can afford it. \n, when it cancelled 52 dates on their spring/summer tour, committed to paying all 67 freelancers involved in their productions their fees for the full tour. Most summer festivals \u2013 few of which receive public subsidy \u2013 are simply unable to make such a gesture and are asking those who have bought tickets to donate their value in full or in part to help pay the cancelled artists and seasonal staff. Some, such as Garsington, have pledged to pay 20% of their contracted artists\u2019 fees, and are fundraising for more.\n festival was due to take place in mid April and had already invested heavily in publicity, commissions and other costs. The festival has committed to paying all its artists 50% of their fees, and has a small buffer in the shape of some Arts Council funding and financial assistance from Leeds city council, but in the main is relying on ticket holders donating the cost of their tickets and/or gifting \n.\n\u201cThe first signs are that people are being very generous and are donating their ticket costs, which will allow us to pay our artists as promised, but we will make a big loss this year,\u201d says director Joseph Middleton. Middleton is also a pianist who performs throughout the UK and internationally. \u201cI\u2019m directing the festival with two hats on and am acutely aware of both sides,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAs an artist I\u2019ve had all of my income wiped overnight for the next three months. Twenty-three gigs so far have been cancelled. Only one of those has offered to pay me. I\u2019ve gone from earning pretty well to earning nothing.\u201d He, like all his fellow self-employed musicians, has to fund the costs of his travel and accommodation and also pay an agent from their concert fee.\n\u201cNone of us earn much money. You will be seeing people going bankrupt,\u201d says soprano Elizabeth Watts, who was just one night into her role as the Countess in \n before it was cancelled. \u201cAs soon as the announcement was made, ENO told us that we were going to be paid to the end of the scheduled run, which has been the hugest relief for us, but so many people don\u2019t have that,\u201d she says.\nNor is it just the creatives who are facing the bleakest of times. Earlier this week, \n announced its bankruptcy. Agents \u2013 who take a cut (usually 10 or 15%) of their clients\u2019 fees, have also suddenly seen their incomes switched off.\n\u201cThis is a monumental crisis,\u201d says Trubridge. \u201cI\u2019m getting sick of hearing how businesses are going to be supported so that they can pay their staff during this closure period and yet nothing is being said about all these freelancers who have got no money now.\u201d\n\u201cI know there isn\u2019t a magic money tree,\u201d says Middleton, but, \u201cyou can have a full-time job and be at home and be paid 80%, yet a self-employed person is only entitled to \u00a394 a week, and that\u2019s only if you don\u2019t have savings. It\u2019s crippling.\u201d\nThe arts are a huge contributor to the economy \u2013 and to our emotional wellbeing. \u201cIf you want people to keep producing art at the highest level, people are going to need financial support. We don\u2019t want only rich people to be able to be artists in years to come,\u201d says Watts.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef983fb4568b0ce1e715bdb0fb39662041ade80/0_37_4289_2574/master/4289.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb3d7ea842090cc9fb2b2b7671be139e"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/1312-by-james-montague-review-inside-the-world-of-footballs-ultras": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/1312-by-james-montague-review-inside-the-world-of-footballs-ultras", "title": "1312 by James Montague review \u2013 inside the world of football's ultras", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 12:00:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>The hardest edge of football\u2019s soft power \u2013 a daring insider\u2019s guide to the violent but complex world of ultra fans </p><p>Ultras are notoriously difficult to define.

Most shocking of all, perhaps, are the productions in which the audience sits in rows, with the stage behind a proscenium arch. The Young Vic is a theatre that turns things topsy-turvy. The conventional is made shocking. Classics seem like new plays; new plays are treated as classics.\nIts success is down, at least in part, to David Lan, who served as artistic director from 2000 to 2018, overseeing a major refurbishment and luring talent and audiences of all kinds to the small building, formerly a butcher\u2019s shop and a bombsite. He has travelled the world and brought its greatest directors and ensembles back to this country, from Iceland, Africa, Australia, as others would bring back duty-free cigarettes. As a young man he witnessed that happy and forgotten time when Peter Daubeny\u2019s world theatre season ran annually at the Aldwych, and when the National \n thought itself duty bound to host great foreign companies led by directors such as Peter Stein, Roger Planchon and Patrice Ch\u00e9reau. Ch\u00e9reau worked at the National in 1974, but did not return to this country until 2011 \u2013 at Lan\u2019s invitation. The Young Vic became one of the few theatres in Britain to have a global perspective.\nIn 2015 it was widely reported that Lan had unsuccessfully applied to become co-director of the National, with \n. \n makes no mention of this, but is firm proof, were it needed, that the theatre\u2019s board made a grave mistake. Lan\u2019s writing glows with his humanity and skill, with his literal worldliness, as he patches together into one narrative all the many lives he has led.\nBorn in South Africa in 1952 to a family of eastern European Jews, he has been a student of JM Coetzee at the University of Cape Town, where he was caught up in anti-apartheid protests. He has worked at the Royal Court theatre, in a world of seedy 70s glamour, a life of freezing bedsits and Aldermaston marches. He has been a librettist for two operas, and the writer of some 20 plays and TV scripts. He has translated Chekhov. He has been playwright Nicholas Wright\u2019s partner for over half-a-century. He has been conscripted into, and escaped from, the South African army. He has conducted two years of field research in northern Zimbabwe, and his study of the interrelation of guerrilla warfare with the local mediums possessed by the spirit of dead ancestors, \n (1985), is still a classic anthropological text.\nLan constructs his memoir from short scenes that flick between these numerous existences, arranged in delightful disorder and written with the playwright\u2019s flair for dialogue. Memories are not narrated so much as displayed through reconstructed conversation, as if Ivy Compton-Burnett had written a memoir: everything is shown, nothing is told. Lan\u2019s ear for different modes of speech is brilliant, from his Jewish grandmother\u2019s \u201cbeetroot voice\u201d to his assistant in Zimbabwe, who starts every story with \u201clong back ago\u201d. He conjures portraits of directors from Luc Bondy to Ivo van Hove, of writers such as \n and David Mamet. He watches, as a child and as an adult, his parents\u2019 marriage and health unravel; he crawls with his tape recorder near the flames and the drummers as a long-dead ancestor takes possession of a Zimbabwean spirit medium.\nTo read the book is to swim in someone else\u2019s memory, unsure what is real, and what has been damaged or retinted by the passage of time, and by the memoirist\u2019s ability to dramatise. Lan writes in that risky tense, the historical present, but readers who think themselves allergic to it should take some form of literary antihistamine and jump in. The book\u2019s disarray of scenes and tenses, its slippery use of time, has a purpose. Lan is linking memory with theatre, and theatre with life. The narrative is constantly reconfiguring itself, like the auditorium of the Young Vic. He intercuts a drama on stage with a drama in his life, using dozens of quick-fire scene changes. Madame Ranevskaya, as she mourns her drowned son in Chekhov\u2019s \n, is spliced with his own mother, grieving his brother\u2019s death from polio. Disconcertingly, he never employs a trio of asterisks \u2013 a literary black-out \u2013 to indicate the break between fiction and memory. Threads of recollection, truth and trickery are tightly interwoven through the book, linking the uncertainties of remembrance past with the uncertainties of theatre: the illusion of a reality that can seem more real than real life.\nHe is \u201cDovidol\u201d to his Jewish grandmother; \u201cDave\u201d to his mother; \u201cMaster Davey\u201d to the gardener in his childhood home; \u201cGunner 68351048\u201d to an angry sergeant; \u201cdear David\u201d to Peter Brook. But in the end, Lan\u2019s many lives are entwined, to reveal them, all along, to have been one life, well lived. The dramatis personae are colleagues, friends, lovers, mentors, mentees; they are subjected to his scrutiny as he tries to unravel the complexities of societies and relationships, on stage and on paper, sparing nobody, least of all himself. The distance between the playwright, the director, and the social anthropologist is not that far, after all.\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbaccea5a9931318eca764501bad029a635a62e7/0_130_7073_4247/master/7073.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ccdb568a6e46cb19226e570368e551a"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell-review-shakespearean-drama-son-grief-twin-sister": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell-review-shakespearean-drama-son-grief-twin-sister", "title": "Hamnet by Maggie O'Farrell review \u2013 immersive Shakespearean drama", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:30:21 GMT", "summary": "<p>In her profound study of grief and love, longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, O\u2019Farrell explores the lives of the playwright\u2019s family and the death of his only son</p><p>In <em>Hamnet,</em> Maggie O\u2019Farrell has placed the bit players of the Shakespeare story centre stage, while the dramatist himself is never even named.

The passenger door was open, causing the interior to light up. A lot of luck was involved. I had saved up for and bought a new camera, but at the time I didn\u2019t really know how to use it. I took several pictures of this same scene and they were mostly blurry, but this shot came into focus.\nIf it looks composed that\u2019s because I was thinking of all the movies and cinematography that I love: \n or \n. It was all just there in front of me. Before this moment, I was just a visitor in the city taking photographs at regular tourist spots.\nI didn\u2019t have any social media presence back then, but I would occasionally share pictures on my personal Facebook page. I put this image online and it created a real buzz with my friends, who encouraged me to take more in the same style. As a result, I spent each night of my holiday capturing the streets of Tokyo after midnight. When Adobe and the Saatchi Gallery shared it things went wild. It was quite intimidating. I didn\u2019t consider myself a photographer, and yet suddenly my work was being viewed by thousands of people and in great detail. I found it challenging. I hadn\u2019t even heard of the phrase \u201cpixel peep\u201d \u2013 when other photographers look closely into every single detail of an image and find its flaws. But it made me want to practise more to master the technical side of photography rather than just relying on the camera\u2019s automatic settings.\nI specialise in night photography now, so I\u2019m often walking around looking for a strong light source. Low-light photography has its own set of challenges, which I love. I probably wouldn\u2019t have noticed the taxi driver if he hadn\u2019t been lit up by the open car door. I know the door invites a story, but I\u2019m not a storyteller. I\u2019m actually really bad at writing. When it comes to photography, for me it\u2019s really about capturing moments. I\u2019ve never had to inject a narrative into my photography work, I much prefer to leave it open to interpretation. \nA lot of people tell me my work reminds them of Blade Runner. Every still in that movie is like a painting. \n, who worked on \n, is one of my main inspirations \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant at using strong silhouettes and restricted colour palettes. I try to combine the kind of treatment you see in films with the composition techniques of old black-and-white photographers. My absolute favourite is \nand his 1950s images of Hong Kong. But I never went down the route of that style of photography. It was more about seeing movies and trying to figure out how I could apply those techniques to street photography and combine it with my expertise developing styles as an art director for video games.\nIt was in Tokyo during that trip that I discovered another key influence. I\u2019d been to the Imperial Palace and stumbled upon the old book district, Jinb\u014dch\u014d. I found an old copy of the late \n\u2019s art book: Kronolog \u2013 a rare discovery in perfect condition with the LaserDisc still in its wrapper. \n and it was his work that inspired my photography. \nI think people found the image compelling because it felt like a frame from a movie. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a perfect image, but it means a lot to me and was the beginning of my series TO:KY:OO \u2013 capturing the beauty of Tokyo at night. The photograph kickstarted my photography career, which in turn connected me with people and opportunities that would not have been possible had I never pressed the shutter button. \n \n.\nEdinburgh, 1987.\n \n degree from Abertay University, Dundee.\n \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n.\n \u201cConnecting with people through photography.\u201d\n \u201cLacking the confidence to pursue art as a career.\u201d\n \u201cFind your voice \u2013 seek all of the things that inspire you and create something wild.\u201d\n", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d0eb0229648449a296fc529401e0974ca64cf3/0_0_5760_3240/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2cb86ac7468fc592ac0f0b141fb8a9a9"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/mar/25/the-black-pioneers-new-york-kamoinge-collective-in-pictures-louis-draper-african-american-photography": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/mar/25/the-black-pioneers-new-york-kamoinge-collective-in-pictures-louis-draper-african-american-photography", "title": "Visions of blackness: New York\u2019s photography pioneers \u2013\u00a0in pictures", "published": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 07:00:53 GMT", "summary": "<p>In 1963, Louis Draper set up a group of African American photographers dedicated to documenting black experiences.
