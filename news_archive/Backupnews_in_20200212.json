He said, \"that was when I was 19\".\nIn an appearance on Have I Got News For You in 2005, he admitted being given the drug, but suggested he hadn't actually taken it: \"\"I think I was once given cocaine but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\"\nWhile he was working as a journalist in the early 1990s, Mr Johnson had a conversation with a friend , Darius Guppy, who had been demanding the private address of a News of the World journalist.\nA recording of the call suggested Mr Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though Guppy, who was later jailed for fraud, had indicated he had wanted to have the reporter, who had been investigating his affairs, beaten up.\nIn a BBC interview in 2013, Mr Johnson stressed that \"nothing eventuated\" from the conversation and that people often said \"fantastical things\" to close friends of theirs.\nResponding to Mr Corbyn, Mr Johnson said the Labour leader had \"no right to conflate\" the actions of those deported this week with the mistreatment of the descendants of Windrush families who came from the Commonwealth to work in post-war Britain.\n\"I think quite frankly the honourable gentleman demeans himself and besmirches the reputation of the Windrush generation who came to this country to work in our public services and teach our children, to make lives better for the people of this country.\"\nMr Corbyn also called for Dominic Raab to be removed as foreign secretary, accusing him of misleading the family of Harry Dunn over the true identity of Anne Sacoolas, the woman suspected of causing his death by dangerous driving outside a US air base last summer.\nHe said it had been \"widely reported\" that Ms Sacoolas, whose extradition the US has rejected on grounds of diplomatic immunity, worked for the CIA while in the UK, suggesting this information had been withheld from the family.\nMr Johnson rejected this, saying the US authorities had told the Foreign Office that Ms Sacoolas had \"no official role\". \nHe pledged to continue to press the US to allow her to face justice in the UK while acknowledging the extradition treaty between the two countries was \"imbalanced\".\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51446665": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51446665", "title": "Regulator Ofcom to have more powers over UK social media", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 07:35:00 GMT", "summary": "Tech firms will need to ensure that illegal content is quickly removed from their platforms.", "story": "New powers will be given to the watchdog Ofcom to force social media firms to act over harmful content.\nUntil now, firms like Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have largely been self-regulating.\nThe companies have defended their own rules about taking down unacceptable content, but critics say independent rules are needed to keep people safe. \nIt is unclear what penalties Ofcom will be able to enforce to target violence, cyber-bullying and child abuse. \nThere have been widespread calls for social media firms to take more responsibility for their content, especially after the death of Molly Russell who took her own life after viewing graphic content on Instagram.\nThe government has now announced it is \"minded\"  to grant new powers to Ofcom - which currently only regulates the media and the telecoms industry, not internet safety.\nOfcom will have the power to make tech firms responsible for protecting people from harmful content such as violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse - and platforms will need to ensure that content is removed quickly.\nThey will also be expected to \"minimise the risks\" of it appearing at all.\nThe regulator has just announced the appointment of a new chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, who will take up the role in March. \n\"There are many platforms who ideally would not have wanted regulation, but I think that's changing,\" said Digital Secretary Baroness Nicky Morgan.\n\"I think they understand now that actually regulation is coming.\"\nJulian Knight, chair elect of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee which scrutinises social media companies, called for \"a muscular approach\" to regulation.\n\"That means more than a hefty fine - it means having the clout to disrupt the activities of businesses that fail to comply, and ultimately, the threat of a prison sentence for breaking the law,\" he said.\nIn a statement, Facebook said it had \"long called\" for new regulation, and said it was \"looking forward to carrying on the discussion\" with the government and wider industry.\nCommunication watchdog Ofcom already regulates television and radio broadcasters, including the BBC, and deals with complaints about them.\nThis is the government's first response to the Online Harms consultation it carried out in the UK in 2019, which received 2,500 replies.\nThe new rules will apply to firms hosting user-generated content, including comments, forums and video-sharing - that is likely to include Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. \nThe intention is that government sets the direction of the policy but gives Ofcom the freedom to draw up and adapt the details.

The UK is the largest contributor to this fund.\nA senior British diplomat wrote to Lady Scotland on 3 February to say that continued UK funding would be suspended until the Commonwealth Secretariat complied with the recommendations of the KPMG report. \nThese conditions included a register of occasions when procurement rules were waived, a register of real and potential conflicts of interest, and an updating of the body's whistleblower policy. \nThe official gave the secretariat a deadline of 21 February to implement all the reforms which would have to be signed off by the chairman of the Commonwealth's independent audit committee. \nA spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \"We are committed to an effective Commonwealth that delivers for its member states, so we have set a number of conditions on UK funding to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation for this financial year. \n\"These include conditions relating to ensuring that the Secretariat's procurement policy and its implementation are in line with international best practice.\"\nA Commonwealth spokesperson said:  \"The Commonwealth Secretariat does not comment on private exchanges with its member countries.  \n\"The Secretariat complies fully with the audit process and implements recommendations accordingly.\" \nNew Zealand has also put its \u00a31.5m contribution on hold. \nA spokesman for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: \"An independent audit report by KPMG has identified significant weaknesses in the Commonwealth Secretariat's approach to managing procurement. As a result, New Zealand has put on hold its voluntary financial contribution to the Secretariat until we receive independent confirmation the recommendations from the audit report have been addressed by the Secretariat.\"\nAustralia has gone one step further and cut its funding to the Commonwealth Secretariat by \u00a3414,000 and has made its remaining contribution of \u00a3260,000 contingent on the reforms being implemented. \nA spokesperson for Australia's Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade said: \"This new funding amount will be paid only after there is independent confirmation that the issues identified in the audit have been addressed by the Secretariat.\" \nCommonwealth high commissioners called in KPMG last September amid concerns about the secretariat's financial procedures.  \nThe resulting report by the Commonwealth's audit committee accused Lady Scotland of \"circumventing\" the usual competitive tendering rules by awarding a \u00a3250,000 commission to KYA Global to carry out a review of the secretariat. \nThe consultancy firm was owned by Lord Patel of Bradford, a friend of Lady Scotland and a fellow Labour peer.\nThe audit committee report - dated last November - claimed Lord Patel's firm was \"apparently insolvent\" at the time with debts worth more than \u00a340,000. And it stated that the Commonwealth Secretariat was unable to provide the auditors with KYA Global's final report setting out its recommendations.\nThe report also found that the Secretariat had no register either of tender waivers or conflicts of interest and was unable to explain why not. Under Commonwealth rules, competitive tendering procedures can be waived in certain circumstances, such as if a decision has to be taken urgently or if there are not enough suppliers. \nThe committee identified 50 occasions between July 2015 and June 2018 when the usual procurement tenders had been waived by the Commonwealth Secretariat. Some of these decisions predated Lady Scotland's appointment in April 2016. \nLady Scotland's lawyers have insisted the decision to award the contract to Lord Patel's firm was fully justified and complied with procurement procedures at the time.\nIn a statement last month, Lady Scotland's solicitors, Carter-Ruck, said KYA Global Ltd was awarded the two contracts \"on the basis of its proven track record in change management consultancy\" and its services were \"dearly needed\" at the beginning of Lady Scotland's term of office.\nIt said: \"This decision was wholly justifiable and SG Scotland was advised that this complied with the procurement procedures that were in force at the time.\"\nThe statement continued: \"The Secretariat has complied fully with the request of its auditors and has adopted and implemented, or is implementing, their recommendations.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51465800": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51465800", "title": "Labour leadership: Long-Bailey backs call to expel 'transphobic' members", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:00:51 GMT", "summary": "Labour leadership contender sparks social media row after signing up to trans rights pledge.", "story": "Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has signed up to a pledge to expel party members who have expressed \"transphobic\" views.\nIt is part of a 12-point plan by the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights.\nThe pledge has now been signed by leadership contender Lisa Nandy too - but critics say it could lead to a \"witch hunt\" of party members.\nIt comes amid a highly-charged debate on gender identity including potential reforms to the Gender Recognition Act.\nThe recently-formed Labour Campaign for Trans Rights says its 12 pledges will help \"rid the party of transphobia\". \nThe pledges include accepting that there is \"no material conflict between trans rights and women's rights\" - and supporting the expulsion of Labour members who \"express bigoted, transphobic views\".\nThe group states that \"trans women are women, trans men are men\".\nThey also back the fight against what the group alleges are \"transphobic organisations\", naming two in particular; Woman's Place UK and the LGB Alliance.\nWoman's Place UK, which says it campaigns to defend women's \"hard-won rights\", said it \"absolutely refutes\" claims their organisation is transphobic, describing the allegations as \"scurrilous\" and \"defamatory\".  \nPosting on Twitter, the group's co-founders said they were Labour members and called on the party to \"defend us or expel us\". \nThe LGB Alliance, who state that \"biological sex is observed at birth and not assigned\", promised to \"keep speaking the truth and remain open to reasonable discussion\". \nA number of twitter users, who also say they are Labour members, are now using the hashtag #expelme in protest at the pledges, while others have suggested the trans rights pledge could lead to a \"witch hunt\".  \nIn 2018, the government launched a consultation on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act, the results of which have yet to be published.\nA Whitehall source has told the BBC the reforms are \"on ice\".\nLeading LGBT charity Stonewall is among those groups who say that the current process, whereby trans people can have their identity legally recognised, is lengthy, intrusive and badly out of date. \nBut others have objected to what's known as self-identification or self-declaration, highlighting their concerns around the implications for women's sport and access to single sex spaces.  \nBroader arguments have played out in court, with the recent case of a woman who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex. \nThe woman, Maya Forstater, was among those to tweet the #expelme hashtag.

We have to be even more ambitious in the future.\"\nFollowing the government's announcement on bringing a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles forward to 2035, he said there would be further initiatives through the year on areas such as energy generation, construction, house-building and energy-intensive industries.\nHe said: \"One of the reasons we think it's so important is not just because we're hosting COP but also because we believe the UK has a moral responsibility to lead.\"\nMr Gove added that the talks needed to see greater climate action by countries, a recognition of the loss and damage suffered by poorer nations as a result of warming temperatures, the need for climate funding and the role of nature-based solutions.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51468919":

statistician hopes other data sources could replace the 200-year-old questionnaire.", "story": "The 2021 census could be the last one ever to be carried out, the UK's national statistician has revealed. \nProf Sir Ian Diamond said he was examining cheaper alternatives to the 10-yearly compulsory questionnaire delivered to every UK household.\nThe census, which has been conducted for almost 200 years, provides valuable population information to help councils and the government plan services. \nBut Sir Ian said he was \"hopeful\" data from other sources could replace it.\n\"The census is frankly as good as it is possible to get,\" he said.\n\"Let's see if we can get to a similar place, more quickly, using different strategies.\"\nAlthough the roots of census-taking in Britain can be traced back to the Domesday Book in 1086, it was not until 1801 that an official census was conducted, when the population of England, Scotland and Wales was recorded to be nine million. \nHowever, statisticians regard the 1841 census, when each head of the household was required to fill in a form on behalf of everyone living at the address on a particular day, as the first modern census. \nThe method has stood the test of time - with more questions about the characteristics of each household member added over the years - but costs have ballooned. \nThe Office for National Statistics, which has responsibility for the census in England and Wales, said an estimated \u00a3906m would be spent next time - nearly double the figure for 2011. \nThe censuses for Scotland and Northern Ireland, which are conducted at the same time, are administered separately. \nSir Ian acknowledged that costs had been rising, though he pointed out that a drive to get most people to complete next year's census online would allow resources to be targeted at those who were less likely to respond. \nThe former University of Aberdeen vice-chancellor said his officials would undertake research, alongside the census, to find out if accurate information could be obtained via other means, such as the Ordnance Survey, GP lists, council tax records and driving licence details. \nHe said such \"administrative data\" - combined with regular, large-scale population surveys - could provide \"better and more granular\" information in a \"cheaper\" and \"more timely\" way, though he said no decisions had been taken. \n\"We'd only move away from [the census] if we can replicate that richness of data,\" he said, adding that the government would have the final say after the census results and research had been evaluated, in 2023.\nIn a 2018 white paper, the government said its \"ambition\" was that \"other sources of data\" would be used after 2021, though it did not explicitly say that the census itself should be scrapped. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51460315": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51460315", "title": "UK trade will thrive despite border

Some might argue it has been inevitable since the election. \nBut the change in the way the UK trade border functions with our biggest trade partner is one of the single biggest changes to the way the UK economy functions.\nPut simply, many industries rely on the frictionless free flow of goods between the UK and the continent.\nThe unequivocal message from Michael Gove is that businesses should prepare for the the end of that as 2020 draws to a close.\nWhereas the impact of all this in the Irish Sea has garnered considerable attention, the new trading arrangements between Dover and Calais and along the Channel Tunnel will have a bigger effect on the economy.\nBy getting businesses to take the prospect seriously, the government's hope is that more will be prepared and so delays and disruption can be limited.\nBut we are dealing with parts of the border that are designed to run without checks.\nThere will need to be more customs officers, thousands more customs agents, mass recruitment of vets, and new customs posts.\nAlmost every independent economic analysis - and the government's own until now - has shown that extra trade friction with what is currently our biggest market will be an overall hit to the economy.\nPreparation can help alleviate some of that hit, but not all.\nBusinesses also said they face extra costs from checks. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said that for many businesses, border delays would incur higher costs than tariffs.\nAdam Marshall, the BCC director general, said: \"Additional friction will equal higher costs for a lot of our business, and while the discussion over the past few months has focussed a lot on tariffs, it's actually these border costs... that really is the biggest source of cost for most.\"\nEU trade will not be waved through with zero checks, which would have been the case under a no-deal Brexit.\nTraders will not be able to use special arrangements to lodge new paperwork after a grace period at a later date.\nIndustries from car manufacturers to food distributors, which rely on the frictionless free flow of goods with the continent, say they face extra costs, delays and red tape from what are known as non-tariff barriers.\nProducts of animal origin will need export certificates from a registered vet.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51453457": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51453457", "title": "Government pledges \u00a35bn for bus services and cycling routes", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 14:30:08 GMT", "summary": "Labour says the plan \"doesn't make up for deep cuts\" to services since 2010.", "story": "The government has pledged \u00a35bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. \nBoris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares.\nMr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would \"improve quality of life and productivity\". \nBut Labour said the PM's plan \"doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010\" that have led to thousands of route closures.\nThe announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project.\nMr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. \nIn addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the \u00a35bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 \"zero-carbon\" buses in England and Wales.\nOther planned improvements include:\nIn September, ministers announced \u00a3220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England.

Like the argument about the UK's financial obligations in the Brexit negotiations?  \nIt was left to Michel Barnier to deliver the home truths: the UK's desire to end the transition period this year has left too little time for the negotiations, there will be serious economic consequences if there's no trade deal at the end of them, and British financial services firms won't enjoy special treatment.  \nMeanwhile MEPs are coming to terms with the post-Brexit world. Is the UK an old friend to be embraced or a threat to be neutralised? The reality is it's both and the EU will have to strike a balance. That's going to be the hard part. \nThe UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, visited Australia on a trade mission last week, days after insisting that there would be no alignment with EU rules under any post-Brexit deal.\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, went further than Ms von der Leyen, warning the UK to have \"no illusion\" about the future of its financial services sector, which makes up 6.9% of UK economic output. \"There will not be general, open-ended, ongoing equivalence in financial services,\" he said.\nThe EU had long backed open and fair trade, as with its deals with Canada and Japan, the head of the Commission said. \nWhile she said the EU's aim of a \"zero-tariff, zero-quota trade relation for all goods\" with the UK was unique and unprecedented, she insisted it required guarantees of fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards.\nAlthough the EU did not demand the same type of level playing field with Canada and Japan, it has long stressed that the UK is in a different position because of its \"geographic proximity and economic interdependence with the EU27\".\nThe chair of the European Parliament's UK co-ordination group, David McAllister, told MEPs the EU had to protect the single market - the UK couldn't have the same rights as a member state and a level playing field for fair competition was a pre-condition for a free trade agreement.   \nCroatian minister Nikolina Brnjac, representing the European Council, said that the EU's mandate could not spell out the final outcome as it had to leave space for negotiations. The future relationship should have ambitious provisions for the mobility of people, despite the end of the free movement of people. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51458547": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51458547", "title": "Independent panel to rule on MP bullying claims", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 10:40:40 GMT", "summary": "The House of Commons Commission backs the plans, which a union calls a \"seismic change\" for staff.", "story": "A system \"completely independent of MPs\" is to rule on bullying and sexual harassment complaints in the Commons.\nThe House of Commons Commission backed plans for an \"expert panel\", replacing the committee of MPs that currently has the final say on action taken.\nDame Laura Cox said she was \"extremely pleased\" with the support for the plan, which was recommended in her 2018 report into bullying in Parliament.\nThe FDA union called it a \"seismic change\" for staff.\n\"I am very happy to see that the Commission has agreed with the preferred option of an independent expert panel, subject to consultation and to a sensible agreement as to a broad range of sanctions,\" Dame Laura said.\n\"I am extremely pleased to see that this option has commanded the most widespread support.\n\"It also meets the requirements of independence and expertise, which are so crucial to the success of any scheme.\"\nHer report, published in 2018, detailed alleged sexual harassment by MPs from women who said they were \"inappropriately touched\" and \"repeatedly propositioned\".\n\"Disturbing\" cases were \"long been tolerated and concealed\", the report from the former High Court judge said, adding that senior House of Commons staff needed to make radical changes.\nIt was followed by other reports, including Gemma White QC's on bullying and harassment of past and present staff of MPs, as well as MPs themselves, and an independent review of Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme.\nAmong those to be accused of bullying was former Speaker John Bercow -

a remarkable result.\nHowever, given how the overall vote has broken down, Sinn F\u00e9in may not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories.\nThe magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats.\nNone of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and now Sinn F\u00e9in - came anywhere close to that figure.\nAttempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts are already getting under way, although this will be complex.\nPrevious administrations in the Republic of Ireland have been forged this way too, but it's taken a while to get there.\nIn 2016, it took 70 days for a government to be formed after the parties agreed a confidence-and-supply agreement, which saw a cabinet of Fine Gael members and independents being propped up by Fianna F\u00e1il votes on key policy areas.\nWith all 160 seats in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) declared, the parties are expected to reconvene in the chamber on 20 February.\nBut it seems unlikely that an agreement on who enters government will emerge in the next eight days.\nUnlike the last Irish election, which was dominated by the other two parties, the Sinn F\u00e9in breakthrough means there are more potential ways for a government to take shape.\nMrs McDonald has begun reaching out to some of the smaller parties - the Greens, Labour, Solidarity People Before Profit and the Social Democrats - to see if their numbers combined could be enough.\nShe said \"the worst outcome\" would be a government again featuring Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in may very well end up working with one of them, given that an entire coalition made up of left-wing parties doesn't add up to a working majority.\nThen there is the bigger head-scratcher of what Fianna F\u00e1il - the party that now has the most seats - does.\nLeader Miche\u00e1l Martin repeatedly said during the campaign he would not work with Sinn F\u00e9in, because of its historic links to the IRA.\nAs the results began rolling in, Mr Martin gave interviews appearing to hold the door open to the prospect of a new government with Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt could still be Miche\u00e1l Martin - but at what political price?\nThere is speculation that if Fianna F\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in agreed to enter government together, the position could be rotated between them.\nOn Monday, Mary Lou McDonald said she believed she \"may well be the next taoiseach\".\nFine Gael, now the third biggest party, has so far repeated its pledge that it will not enter government with Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIt has been in government for nine years and, given a poor election result, is likely to go into opposition. \nThe thinking from Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il appears to be leaving it to Sinn F\u00e9in, regarded as having 'won' the election, to hit the ground running on the formation of the next government.\nAnd then consider how stable any new coalition government will be.\nIn short, there are lots of concerns for the three big parties but no precedent as to how it might unfold.\nWho knows?\nHe will continue as acting taoiseach until a deal is agreed for a new government - effectively in office but without power.\nWhile he has gained a solid international reputation due to his role in the Brexit negotiations, voters didn't respond to that issue and already there have been some calls for the Fine Gael leader to stand down.\nFormer Fine Gael minister James Reilly said the party had made a \"number of mistakes\" in the campaign - but Mr Varadkar's deputy, Simon Coveney, defended him and insisted he should remain at the top.\nThe significance of what has happened cannot be overstated.\nThe Republic of Ireland has voted, in the most part, for the same two centre-right parties for decades.\nEven if Sinn F\u00e9in does not make it into power this time, it will be hard for any party who does enter government to overlook what Irish voters have told them at the polls. \nTime - and possibly plenty of it - will tell.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51443191": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51443191", "title": "Work 'under way' into Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge feasibility", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 17:07:52 GMT", "summary": "Number 10 says \"a range of government officials\" are looking at the idea of a linking bridge.", "story": "Work is under way \"by a range of government officials\" to look at the idea of building a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge, No 10 has said.\nBoris Johnson has described the bridge as a \"very interesting idea\", while Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar has said it was \"worth examining\".\nBut Nicola Sturgeon said there were \"more important priorities\".\nTwo routes have previously been floated -

HS2 Ltd rejects that claim.\nOne of the big unknowns, which was underestimated on the first phase, was \"ground conditions\".\nNow that surveys underneath the surface along the route from London to Birmingham have been done, the higher costings for that first stretch are regarded as more robust.\nBut surveys have not been carried out on the latter and longer phase, Birmingham to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds. \nAnd that's why the price tag for the second phase of HS2 is not certain. \nHS2 will wind its way through a crowded landscape. The initial stretch from London Euston to Old Oak Common in west London will be through a giant tunnel underneath central London.\nTo build the line, HS2 Ltd has to compulsorily purchase land and property rights along the route, and a block of flats in London doesn't come cheap.\nHS2 Ltd's land and property calculations, which it was using as recently as 2015-16, were woefully underestimated.\nIn one of the studies commissioned by HS2 Ltd, and seen by the BBC, a large number of properties were not even given a value.\nSince then HS2 Ltd has carried out more thorough work to improve its estimates. \nTry to imagine all of the wiring and piping underneath our crowded cities.\nMuch of the work HS2 Ltd has already carried out between London and Birmingham has been diverting those connections away from construction sites.\nBut in some places, roads and even rivers need to be moved too.\nOn the M42 near Solihull they have been building the foundations for a new bridge over the motorway. A bridge nearby will be demolished and the new bridge moved in.\nYou could find multiple examples like that along the 330 mile route.\nI've travelled extensively on Spain's high-speed AVE network, which flies through large stretches of desolate, arid countryside. Britain is much more densely populated, so building HS2 is a different ballgame. \nYou might be surprised to hear that the view out of the window from an HS2 train from London to Birmingham, most of the time, won't be very exciting.\nThat's because a large part of the route will be built in what's known as \"cuttings\".\nCuttings mean the track is effectively below ground with banks each side. The cutting reduces the impact of the line on the surrounding countryside.\nThere are also 25 miles of tunnels on the first phase of the project. The longest (10 miles) and deepest tunnel (90 metres at the deepest point) will go underneath the Chilterns.\nAnd there are 12 miles of viaducts. A two mile viaduct in the Colne Valley in Buckinghamshire will be the longest in the country. \nWhen prior estimates of costings on HS2 have been calculated, efficiency savings have been factored in. However, often those efficiencies have not been realised, so costs have gone up.\nIn a major infrastructure project such as this, the company in overall charge - HS2 Ltd - contracts out the work to a vast array of other companies.\nCompanies contracted by HS2 Ltd in the early part of the project carried the risk associated with the work. That pushed prices up significantly.\nAccording to the National Audit Office it added at least \u00a31bn to the overall budget. However, there have been reports that figure was much higher.\nNow contractors do not carry the risk. That should help keep prices down.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51433590": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51433590", "title": "Huawei: UK 5G concerns 'a witch-hunt' says Chinese ambassador", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 11:19:40 GMT", "summary": "Its UK ambassador criticises Tory politicians opposed to the firm's role in the UK's mobile network.", "story": "China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, says Tory politicians opposed to Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting \"a witch-hunt\".Some senior Conservatives have written to Tory MPs to raise concerns about the government's decision to give Huawei a role in the network.\nThe group, including four ex-cabinet ministers, want \"high-risk\" vendors ruled out now, or phased out over time.\nBut Mr Liu told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show \"they were totally wrong\".\n\"I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt,\" he said. \"Huawei is a private-owned company, nothing to do with the Chinese government... the only problem they have is they are a Chinese company.\"\nSeveral senior Conservatives have warned Huawei involvement in the UK's next generation mobile internet network poses a security risk and could lead to the first significant Commons rebellion against Boris Johnson's government. \nBut Mr Liu said the firm operated totally independently of the Chinese state and was a leader in the field of 5G. \n\"The reason why the [UK] prime minister decided to keep Huawei is he has a very ambitious plan for the UK, he wants to have 5G coverage in the UK by 2025, and Huawei can help.\"\nBut he criticised the 35% cap that the government had put on Huawei's involvement, saying it was not in keeping with the principle of a \"free economy\". \nAnd, when asked about President Trump being unhappy with the UK, he said \"I will leave the prime minister to deal with President Trump\".\nMr Liu said: \"The UK can only be great when it has own independent foreign policy.  I hope the prime minister will stay with the decision because I think it's in interest of the UK and maintaining Britain's image as most open and free market economy in the world.\" \nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the Huawei decision followed a \"rigorous\" review by security experts and that the firm's involvement would be restricted.\nBut the senior Conservatives have said there are alternatives to the Chinese firm.\nThe letter from Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, David Davis, Damian Green, Tobias Ellwood and Bob Seely, which has been seen by the BBC, says some MPs were \"working to find a better solution\".\n\"We are seeking to identify a means by which we ensure that only trusted vendors are allowed as primary contractors into our critical national infrastructure,\" it says.\n\"Trusted vendors would be companies from countries that have fair market competition, rule of law, respect human rights, data privacy and non-coercive government agencies.\"\nThe signatories say they want the government to \"rule out hi-tech from untrusted, high-risk vendors\" in the UK's infrastructure, or to ensure future legislation includes \"sunset clauses\" to limit the length of time such companies can be used.\nThe letter comes after US vice-president Mike Pence said the US was \"profoundly disappointed\" with the UK's decision. \nThe UK government has said restrictions would be in place on Huawei's role in the 5G network.\nThese include: banning Huawei from supplying kit to \"sensitive parts\" of the network, only allowing it to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, and excluding the firm's equipment from areas near military bases and nuclear sites.\nBut Sir Iain and the others behind the letter have also cited examples of other countries which they said had already rejected using Huawei in their 5G networks at all, including Australia, the US and Japan.\n"},

debate", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 17:00:41 GMT", "summary": "MPs urge Labour not to ignore research by Tory pollster Lord Ashcroft into the causes of its poll loss.", "story": "A new opinion poll has thrown fresh fuel on the debate about why Labour suffered such a heavy defeat in December's general election.\nA number of post mortems are already under way into the result, which left Labour with the lowest number of seats since 1935.\nLabour's own internal review, leaked to the Financial Times, points the finger of blame at divisions over the party's Brexit policy - and dismisses criticism of its \"radical\" manifesto and leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nThe four contenders to replace Mr Corbyn as leader have each given their own version of what went wrong.\nNow Lord Ashcroft - the millionaire former deputy chariman of the Conservative Party - has weighed in.\nHis poll of more than 10,000 people, including 18 focus groups in seats Labour lost, suggests the party's muddled stance on Brexit was a major factor in its defeat.\nBut the most popular reason for deserting Labour for the Conservatives or Lib Dems was \"I did not want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister\".\nMore than half of those surveyed for the Diagnosis of Defeat, Labour's Turn to Smell the Coffee report said not believing Labour would be able to deliver on its promises - and no longer feeling the party represented them - also played a part. \nThe report's conclusions echo those from YouGov's polling of 500 people shortly after the 2019 election, which identified the party leadership and Brexit as the two most important factors in voters turning away from Labour.  \nLord Ashcroft is not a member of the British Polling Council, which sets standards for the industry.\nBut his polls are closely watched at Westminster because of the size of them and the fact that they are carried out at constituency level, something of a rarity in British polling.\nHe said some on the left were bound to dismiss his findings because he is a Tory, but he said he wanted a strong opposition party, adding: \"You don't have to trust me - just listen to what real voters have to say in the research.\"\nVoters who deserted Labour for the Lib Dems or the Conservatives were asked by Ashcroft's researchers to select from a list of reasons: \nAfter three Conservative election defeats, in 2005 Lord Ashcroft wrote a stinging report, entitled Smell the Coffee - a wake-up call for the Conservative Party.\nHe has now turned his attention to another former party of government that's floundering in opposition. \nThis time his political brew has a couple of extra shots.\nHis research suggests former Labour voters felt that the party \"could not be trusted with the public finances,

treated them like fools.\"\nAlready, long-standing Corbyn sceptics are weighing in and saying \"I told you so\". Corbyn supporters tend to argue that it was the party's \"confusing\" Brexit stance that was to blame - and that the policies could have been better-presented.\nAshcroft suggests all is not lost for the main opposition party: ''The defectors do not rule out returning to Labour... but they won't do so until it changes\".\nBut, as George Orwell wrote, \"who controls the past controls the future\" - and the lessons Labour learns from its heavy defeat will depend less on research like this and more on who triumphs in the party's leadership contest.\nCorbyn supporters and sceptics alike insist that they really have woken up and smelt the coffee -  but they are inhaling very different blends. \nDeputy leadership contender Ian Murray - no fan of the Corbyn project - said the Ashcroft poll was an \"urgent wake-up call\" for the party, and that the party needed to recognise that \"Tory voters are not the enemy - they are all potential Labour voters\".\n\"Recovery is not inevitable and if we don't make the changes voters want to see, we will face another devastating election defeat next time.\"\nEx-frontbencher Lucy Powell, who ran Ed Miliband's unsuccessful 2015 election campaign and is now heading up a review of the party's latest defeat, said it made for \"very sober and, in places, difficult reading\".\nJess Phillips, who had a brief tilt at the leadership before dropping out of the contest last month, said listening to hard truths was a necessary step towards \"rebuilding and reconnecting with people\".\nShe tweeted: \"Anyone who has knocked a door will know that the focus group stuff is accurate. We do ourselves no favours ignoring this stuff.\"\nMPs on the left of the party have not dismissed Ashcroft's findings, but have said it does not tell the whole story of Labour's electoral woes over the past decade.\nIlford South MP Sam Tarry, a former director of Momentum who ran Mr Corbyn's leadership campaign in 2016, told the BBC that predominately older voters in working-class, provincial towns did not just start turning their backs on Labour in December but have \"been moving away from the party since 2005\".\n\"The long-term cultural disconnect between people in cities and those in more rural communities is not something that can be laid at the door of Corbyn or the current leadership,\" he says. \n\"These are issues that have been brewing up for years.\"\nMr Tarry said all the candidates to succeed Mr Corbyn faced a \"conundrum\" in that if they were to move to the right on immigration and other identity-based issues, as the report suggests, they risked alienating the \"massive\" support the party enjoys among younger voters. \nLloyd Russell-Moyle, the MP for Brighton Kemptown, says aspects of the report will resonate with Labour supporters.\nBut he rejects suggestions that a clean break with the Corbyn era is the recipe for electoral success.\n\"It is not true to say that all Labour voters or all historic voters will feel like that,\" he says. \n\"I think the values and policies of Corbynism are the right democratic socialist values that have existed in the party for a very long time.\"\nBut he says the party can learn from its last period in the electoral wilderness and the way it framed its messages on the economy, crime and education in the run-up to its landslide 1997 victory.\n\"I don't think the public vote on policies, they vote on values. I think the failure at the last election was that we offered a lot of transactional policies. We will give you this for free, we will give you that for free but we did not provide a narrative that chimed with people's values.\n\"All the leadership candidates would move the dial in that respect.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51415240": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51415240", "title": "EU fishing rules: Did the UK throw away a million tonnes of fish?", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:45:24 GMT", "summary": "Owen Paterson MP said an EU policy meant fish were thrown dead back into the water.", "story": "UK fishermen were \"throwing back a million tonnes of fish dead\" every year because of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), according to Conservative MP Owen Paterson.  2005 study estimated No one has ever come up with a credible figure of one million tonnes for UK fishermen alone. It's true that UK fishermen were required by EU rules in the past to throw back unwanted or undersized fish - although exactly how much is not known. The EU started reversing these rules in 2016 and by 2019 vessels weren't allowed to throw back any fish subject to quotas. There's some evidence discarding is still happening, though, despite the rule change.\nThe Conservative MP and former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Brexit would allow the UK to become \"an independent maritime nation\" and \"stop the complete horrors\" of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).\nHe said, under CFP rules, UK fishermen were \"throwing back a million tonnes of fish dead as pollution every year\". \nThe UK remains part of the Common Fisheries Policy - which sets the rules on how EU members fish - until the end of the transition period, at the end of this year. The system that will replace it is still up for negotiation. \nUntil relatively recently, EU member states - including the UK - were required to throw some fish back into the water. \nThis controversial practice was known as \"discarding\" and involved returning unwanted catches back to sea (dead or alive) because they were too small or because the crew had exceeded their quota - the amount of fish they were allowed to catch.\nThere is no single accepted figure for this.\nARead more from Reality Check that 500,000 to 800,000 tonnes of fish were discarded in the North Sea each year, but it did not attribute this to any one country.\nIn 2008, a report from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) put the figure for the North Sea at one million tonnes. Again it did not single out the UK. This was calculated by subtracting kilos of fish sold from kilos of fish caught. \nIn 2010, University of Exeter scientists put the figure at 267,000 tonnes of fish discarded in the North Sea in 2010 - and said this figure had declined from about 500,000 tonnes in 1990. \nA House of Lords report published in 2019 said that in 2013 an estimated 1.7 million tonnes of fish and \"other marine animals\" were being thrown back into the sea each year across European waters - again not specifically by UK fishermen.\nThe National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO) told us they did not recognise the one million tonnes figure quoted by Mr Paterson and did not believe an estimate of discarded fish could be reached. \nFrom January 2015 onwards, the EU started reversing its policy on discarding. It introduced a \"landing obligation\" on fishermen to keep the fish they caught.\nThis first applied to \"pelagic\" species of fish (including mackerel and herring) before being extended from 2016 to bottom-dwelling fish (including cod, haddock and plaice).\nBy January 2019, vessels weren't allowed to discard any species of fish for which quotas were used to limit the numbers caught. \nWe spoke to Mr Paterson. He said he was referring to the situation under the old rules but added that he \"knew the discard ban was not going to work\". \nWhile he believed the one million figure to be a widely recognised estimate, he acknowledged that \"the reality is, we don't know\". \nThe discard ban has \"proven challenging to implement\", according to Louisa Casson, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK.\n\"There are many proposed solutions, including observers and CCTV on boats, but none of these are in place across the entire UK fishing fleet,\" she said.  \nAnd there is some evidence vessels are still discarding fish, including video and photographic evidence of illegal discards happening off the coast of Scotland gathered by campaign groups Our Fish and Open Seas. \nA House of Lords report on the landing obligation policy, published in February 2019, said: \"Little attempt appears to have been made to enforce the landing obligation's requirements thus far, allowing the discarding of fish to continue.\"\nThe NFFO said that while the ban was working well for some types of fishing, for others there were \"fundamental difficulties caused by the design of the legislation\" which required a \"fundamental overhaul\".\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50781341": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50781341", "title": "Who will be Labour's next leader?", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 12:37:36 GMT", "summary": "A look at the candidates for leader and deputy leader - and how the winner will be chosen.", "story": "The race to be Labour's next leader is well under way, with the field now narrowed to just four candidates. \nThere is a big task ahead for the successor to Jeremy Corbyn, as they will need to bring the party back from its worst electoral defeat since 1935.\nWe'll find out who gets the top job on 4 April.\nBut for now, here are the hopefuls: \nThe 57-year-old shadow Brexit secretary was the first to make it on to the final ballot after winning the backing of Unison, the shopworkers' union Usdaw, and the Socialist Environment and Resources Association (Sera), an affiliate group. \nHe has also gained the backing of workers' union Community.\nAll candidates need to gain support from three trade unions/affiliate groups representing 5% of the membership to make it on the members' ballot.\nA supporter of remaining in the EU, Sir Keir was director of public prosecutions before becoming MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. \nBut critics have accused him of pushing Labour into its \"renegotiate then referendum\" Brexit position ahead of the 2019 election.

The party's performance at the 2019 General Election was its worst since 1935.  \nBattered over Brexit, losing support in previous strongholds, and led by Jeremy Corbyn whose personal ratings were among the lowest ever recorded, Labour took a hammering.\nCan the new leader turn around the party's prospects?\nHere's what 100 years of voting tells us about the scale of the task ahead.\nMore than 700 million votes have been cast in UK general elections since 1918, some 300 million of them for Labour.\nThe party produced its first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, at the head of a minority government in 1924. \nSince then Labour has won eight general elections and produced five more prime ministers: Clement Attlee (1945-51), Harold Wilson (1964-70 and 1974-76), James Callaghan (1976-79), Tony Blair (1997-2007) and Gordon Brown (2007-10).\nThe 2019 general election was a disaster for Labour, leaving Jeremy Corbyn's party with 202 out of 650 Commons seats. \nLabour's new leader will have fewer colleagues in the House of Commons than any Labour leader has had for 84 years.  \nThe party lost heavily, even in areas where working class supporters had kept Labour afloat for generations.  \nFormer mining communities in north-east England and Wales turned away. The party lost seats in every English region except London. In Scotland, Labour, with just one seat out of 59, have been all but wiped out. \nIn 1983 Labour, under Michael Foot, won just seven seats more than its current tally. \nLabour's poor performance followed a damaging split which resulted in the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). \nAs in 2019, Labour faced sharp criticism over a manifesto widely regarded as too radical. Critics called it \"the longest suicide note in history\".  \nMr Foot also faced Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was riding a crest of popularity, buoyed by victory in the Falklands War against Argentina.\nThe outlook for the new leader may look bleak, but Labour has recovered from heavy defeats before. \nAfter 1983, it took the party a further 14 years to return to power - in 1997, Tony Blair won a landslide victory.\nThe result ended 18 years of Conservative rule under Mrs Thatcher and John Major, and gave Labour 418 seats.  \nTony Blair went on to win two more elections in 2001 and 2005. In electoral terms, he is the most successful leader Labour has ever had.  \nLabour under Mr Blair and Gordon Brown was in power for 13 years.\nSimilarly, in 1945 Labour overcame huge challenges to win with a substantial majority. \nThe Conservative Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had just led the country to victory over the Nazis.  \nThe election took place less than two months after the end of the fighting in Europe.  \nThe Labour leader Clement Attlee mounted a hugely successful campaign for a programme of post-war rebuilding. \nHis 145-seat majority, Labour's first, enabled Mr Attlee to introduce a sweeping programme of reforms, including the introduction of the National Health Service.\nProbably the \"simplest\" way to win would be to recapture most of the seats Labour has lost since the last victory in 2005.\nThese charts show that the parts of the UK where Labour has fallen back most are Scotland and the Midlands - definitely not London where the party has actually grown stronger.\nA huge difficulty with this would be finding a leader, and policies, that could attract voters lost to the Conservatives on the one hand, and the SNP on the other.\nIt would just about be possible to do it without Scotland - Tony Blair always had a majority of English seats - but that would require significant gains across the Midlands and the north of England - plus some parts of the south.\nA third route, but perhaps the least plausible, is a major realignment where Labour won swathes of southern England which the party has never held before.\nWhatever strategy the new leader chooses, they have a massive task ahead of them.\nIf Labour is to make big gains next time, the historical record suggests they are unlikely to come in south-east England.  \nAt no point in the past 100 years has Labour won a majority of the seats there and the Tories have dominated almost the whole region.  \nTony Blair and Clement Attlee made some gains, but even they were limited. \nHugh Gaitskell, who was leader from 1955 to 1963, Harold Wilson (1963-76), James Callaghan (1976-80) and Neil Kinnock (1983-92) made little impact.\nLabour leaders from Ramsay MacDonald in the 1920s right up to Ed Miliband in 2015 saw Scotland as fertile ground. \nEven Michael Foot took 41 seats there in 1983.  \nThe Scottish National Party (SNP), which was founded in 1934, made some gains in the 1970s but took just two seats in 1983.\nIt could hardly be more different now. The outlook for the new Labour leader in Scotland is bleak.  \nSince 2015, the SNP under Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon has dominated almost completely. Labour was almost wiped out in 2015. \nIt made a small comeback in 2017, but was almost wiped out again in 2019.\nIn England, the north east has been Labour's most loyal stronghold.  \nFormer mining communities and other predominantly working class areas voted Labour in large numbers from the party's earliest days. \nBut even here the Tories made significant gains in 2019.  \nThe Conservatives have a higher proportion of north-east England seats than at any time since 1935.  \nBringing constituencies like Blythe Valley, a Labour seat from 1950 to 2019, and Bishop Auckland, Labour from 1935 to 2019, back into the fold will be a major challenge for Labour's new leader.   \nThe Conservative government under Boris Johnson has signalled it will fight hard to stop that happening.\nLondon could be an exception for Labour and its new leader as the capital remains a predominantly Labour city.\nIn 2019 the party performed there as well as it has in any election since 1950, except when Labour was led by Tony Blair.  \nHolding on to seats in London may be an easier task for the new leader than extending support outwards from the capital.\nLikewise the north west of England could be more fertile ground for the new Labour leader.  \nThe party lost seats in this region in 2019, but still holds more than half which is a higher proportion than it held during most of the 20th Century.\nWe analysed data from every general election since 1918 held by the House of Commons Library. \nEach election occupies the same width on the graph.\nWe did not include by-elections. \nData for Northern Ireland were available from 1922 onwards.\nThere have been numerous changes to constituency boundaries and changes in the number of seats in the House of Commons since 1918.\nThe height of each nation or region in the charts is proportional to its current number of constituencies. So Scotland occupies 59/650ths of the graph and Northern Ireland occupies 18/650ths of the graph height as they currently have 59 and 18 constituencies respectively (out of a total of 650). \nThat height is divided between all the seats that were fought in a given election. \nWe have gathered some parties into one category, for example the Liberal Party and the Liberal Democrats or Labour and Independent Labour. \nPrior to 1974, Ulster Unionists are listed in the House of Commons data as Conservatives as they took the Conservative whip.\nWe have also excluded the small numbers of university seats which existed before 1945 and second seats from the two-seat constituencies that existed before 1950. \nNeither significantly alters the proportions shown in the charts.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51416860": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51416860", "title": "Brexit divorce: Five key things the UK must navigate", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 07:17:56 GMT", "summary": "Break-ups are rarely easy and Britain has challenges ahead in forging new trade relationships.", "story": "After cohabiting with the European Union (EU) for 47 years, the UK is now free to play the field.\nBut as is already clear, wooing new suitors while also trying to keep a civil footing with the ex will be tricky.\nWith less than one year to thrash out a trading deal, here are five things the UK now has to work out.\nThe UK is going to have to decide quickly which of its ex-partners' conditions it can live with - and which it is prepared to battle.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson's vision for a global Britain is clear: open for business with an overhauled immigration system that puts \"people before passports\".\nIt's not just about attracting investment. The government wants to be seen as the champion of free trade, especially as it takes its seat at the World Trade Organisation, which sets and polices the default rules of global trading.\nThe UK's break from the EU means it can have a bigger say over some regulations and standards.\nBut exercising that freedom may mean many bumps in the road - and some potentially costly diversions. \nFree or not, the UK does about half of its trade with the EU and maintaining that relationship is key.\nBut the UK's desire to flaunt its liberty complicates that. \nThe greater the freedom to diverge from the EU, the greater the red tape which could mean more hassle and higher costs.  \nThe Withdrawal Agreement referred to a level playing field - that is, the UK not to have an advantage by undercutting the EU on state aid, environmental or labour protections or tax. \nBut the prime minister wants to cut loose from that while claiming it won't be a race to the bottom.\nThe UK also wants the right to diverge from EU rules on product standards.\nBoth are abhorrent to the EU and risk ruling out a zero-tariff deal. \nThe desire to break away from EU rules and standards may be a negotiating pawn but it would allow the UK to be closer to others, crucially the US.  \nThe UK sells more goods and services to the US than to anywhere else and hosts more than half of the regional corporate headquarters of American-owned firm, making closer ties attractive.\nPresident Donald Trump claims a US-UK deal will be \"massive\", but for whom?  \nBoth want greater access to the other's markets. The US wants its drug companies and service providers to have more access to the NHS - something the Conservative manifesto ruled out. \nAnd the US wants more opportunities for its farmers which would mean relaxing agriculture and food hygiene standards. \nMr Johnson says others have to accept the UK's standards - but is that a red line? \nGiving way may mean lowering standards in a way that would be incompatible with EU rules, highlighting the dilemma the UK faces over whom it wants to align with. \nTo complicate issues, while talks with the EU and US will run simultaneously, they come under different Whitehall departments: the Cabinet Office and Department for International Trade respectively.\nThe UK wants new trade deals with \"neglected\" friends, including Canada and Australia and also to finish replicating ones the EU has with about 70 countries. \nSo far it has completed about 50 of the latter. The remainder include Japan, which accounts for about 2% of exports but has great strategic importance as one of the UK's biggest foreign investors.\nAnd the UK is thinking longer term.\nAfrica accounts for less than 3% of UK trade. But with a quarter of the world's population set to live there by 2050, the UK has been on a charm offensive, recently hosting the first African Investment Summit. \nWhat are the chances of a deal being done with the EU by the end of 2020?\nIt will require compromise.\nNegotiating the EU's trade deal with Canada took over five  years. Given the complexities here, there may be only the first stage of a deal, to cover goods and agriculture, by December. Or the prime minister may have backpedalled and asked for more time.\nAnd that's just the deal with the EU.\nIt could be quite a while before we know what shape the UK's new blended global family will take.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51371760": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51371760", "title": "Is the government avoiding the media and does it even matter?", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:55:49 GMT", "summary": "Journalists say the government is not being open and accountable, something the Prime Minister's team denies.", "story": "The media and the government have always had a frosty - or far too cosy - relationship depending on who you want to believe. \nHowever, have things taken a turn for the worst?\nThis week, there was a mass walkout by political journalists after senior reporters say they weren't allowed into a meeting at Number 10.This is denied by those working for the Prime Minister.\nThey argue this is the most open and transparent government in decades.\nThe government is being accused of avoiding tough questions and selecting who it gives background information to. \nA minister told Parliament: \"We reserve the right to brief journalists which we choose whenever we wish to, and that is not something abnormal.\"\nThat's what some critics think. \nThe government hasn't been interviewed on some national BBC news programmes after major news events, like the recent terror attack in London.\nWe asked a minister to appear on @BBCr4today today to explain what they planned to do to stop released terrorists attacking people on the streets.

They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. \nBut that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. \nTerms and conditions always apply and the EU says it has two main conditions.\nFirst and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. \nThese are known as level-playing-field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.  \nMost importantly, its draft negotiating mandate says a future partnership must \"ensure the application\" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. \nThe UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights. \nBut Boris Johnson has publicly ruled out any such commitment and said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. \n\"There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,\" Mr Johnson said in his speech in London.\nHe also pointed out the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.  \nThe EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada. \nThe UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference. But if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. \nEither way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January. \nHis critics accuse him of recklessness but the prime minister says he has \"no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper\".\nThe EU's second condition is a free-trade deal must include an agreement on fisheries - because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. \nThe UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\". \nThe EU sees things rather differently.\nIts draft mandate says a future deal should \"aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters\".\nThat's a lot of access and the EU seems prepared to link it to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.  \nFishing is a tiny part of the UK economy - well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.  \nWhen it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is more flexible. \n\"We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,\" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. \n\"What I am looking for is consistency.\"\nThe UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. \nThe more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. \nThat's true for both goods and services. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. \nInstead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. \nBut talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. \nIt doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.\nThis is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.   \nMr Johnson said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.  \nGaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. \nNow, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free trade agreement. \nIt wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they \"raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law\".\nBut the government's written statement says a future agreement cannot include \"any jurisdiction for the [ECJ] over the UK's laws\".\nThe ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.\nBut a future trade deal is a different matter. \nDevising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. \nIt's not just about trade, it's about internal security cooperation and access to databases too. \n\"Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,\" Michel Barnier said, \"obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full.\"\nThe EU's draft mandate also says there should be \"automatic termination\" of law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order \"must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way\". \nSo there are some big divides to be bridged. \nBoth sides say they would settle for a free-trade agreement but they have to work out how to get there and how to implement it.  \nIt is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. \nThere is a long way to go in a short period of time. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772", "title": "What is climate change?

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

Ceta does not do that.\nCeta gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs (that's taxes on imports) on goods traded between the EU and Canada. Tariffs remain on poultry, meat and eggs.\nIt also increases quotas (that's the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges) but does not get rid of them altogether. For example, quotas on EU cheese exports to Canada increase from 18,500 tonnes to 31,972 tonnes a year.\nIt does little for the trade in services and in particular almost nothing for the trade in financial services, which is very important for the UK economy.\nIt also does not remove border checks, so there is still a possibility that goods have to be examined at ports to make sure they meet regulatory requirements, and their paperwork is in order.\nCeta protects EU \"geographical indications\", meaning for example that you can only make Parma ham in Italy and camembert cheese in France, and Canada can't import something that calls itself camembert from any other country.\nThey have also agreed to open up government contracts to each other, so Canadian companies could bid to build French railways, for example.\nThere is also co-operation between the two countries on standards, so a piece of equipment made in an EU country can go through all its safety and quality checks there, without needing to have them repeated in Canada - and vice versa.\nCeta also allows professional qualifications to be recognised both in Canada and the EU, making it easier, for example, for architects or accountants to work in both places.\nAnd it aligns Canadian rules in some areas of copyright and patents with those of the EU.  \nCountries that are closer to each other tend to trade more, especially in goods, and this is the case with the UK and the EU.\nThe UK exported \u00a3291bn of goods and services to other EU countries in 2018, which was 45% of all UK exports.\nIt imported \u00a3357bn of goods and services from the EU, which was 53% of all UK imports.\nOn the other hand, Canada exported 46.2bn Canadian dollars (\u00a326.7bn) of goods and services to the EU in 2017, which was 7.9% of its exports.\nIt imported 63.6bn Canadian dollars of goods and services to the EU, which was 10.5% of its imports. \nThe prime minister also mentioned having an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's.\nThe EU does not have a free trade deal with Australia. They are in negotiations for one, but they currently operate mainly on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\nThere was an EU-Australia Partnership Framework agreed in 2008, which reduces barriers to trade, but was not a free trade agreement.\nSo, trading on a similar basis to Australia would be largely the same as trading under WTO rules. In other words, it's another way of saying the UK would leave with no trade deal in place. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51267987", "title": "Brexit: Five things the UK needs to resolve after leaving the EU", "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:01:52 GMT", "summary": "Why food, trade and security are some of the key challenges for post-Brexit Britain.", "story": "The UK might have left the EU but many questions remain unanswered. \nHere are just some of the hurdles facing the UK after Brexit.\nThis legal departure from the EU means the UK can finally start formal trade negotiations - both with the EU and countries around the world, like the US. \nThe government is determined not to extend the post-Brexit transition period - to discuss the future relationship with the EU - beyond the end of 2020. This means the timetable for getting an agreement with the EU is extremely tight. \nFormal talks are expected to begin in March, once the remaining 27 EU countries have agreed on instructions for their negotiators. \nGetting any agreement finally signed off and put into practice will take a couple of months towards the end of the year. So, realistically, that only leaves time for a fairly basic free trade deal to emerge, with plenty of issues still up for discussion once the transition period is over. accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs.% of total UK trade in 2018\nThe government talks about getting a \"zero tariff, zero quota\" deal on goods, with no border taxes and no limits on exports and imports. \nBut there are a host of issues to be dealt with if the aim is to keep trade flowing as smoothly as possible, and that is before we mention the services sector. \nFrom financial and business services to the food and drinks industry, this \nIt is of course in the interest of both sides to get a deal done, but it remains a massive task. Expect disputes about fisheries, fair competition, the role of the European Court of Justice and more.\nIt is possible that no deal will be done in time, which will generate a fresh crisis in UK/EU relations as 2020 draws to a close.    \nIf the challenge to get a trade deal within 11 months is not hard enough, the UK must also agree a treaty to paper over legal cracks in the way countries work together on security.\nPolicing and security experts in the UK and the EU agree that things will become harder after Brexit.\nFor instance, the UK no longer has a place on the team that manages Europol, the agency that co-ordinates major investigations into Europe-wide organised crime. \nThis means the UK's priorities - such as concerns about smuggling people or arms across the English Channel - may, slowly, fall down the pecking order. \nBritish police officers can, for now, still use EU systems to check criminal records of foreign nationals, or alerts on wanted people from around the continent. \nBut access to that information could either end or become harder, because many member states have their own specific laws governing data-sharing beyond the EU. \nThe government is trying to think ahead. \nIt has, for instance, pledged to pass laws to ensure the same fast service the UK has enjoyed from the European Arrest Warrant - which allows suspects to be sent to another country for trial - if a deal cannot be struck. Everyone, on both sides, wants that. \nThe question is whether it is legally doable - and if so, can it be done by January 2021?\nFrom farming and fishing to manufacturing and retail, the UK's food and drink sector adds \u00a3460bn to the UK economy every year, employing more than four million people. \nIt represents a fifth of UK manufacturing, by far the biggest chunk of the sector. \nSo there is some nervousness about what will happen to the complicated way that food and drink makes its way to consumers after the end of the transition period. \nA third of people in the industry are from outside the UK, with many from Eastern Europe. What happens if the number of such workers is restricted because of the introduction of a minimum salary being imposed for migrants? \nWhen it comes to trade, there is the prospect products may have to be opened and checked at borders which could add expense and cut the shelf life of fresh food. \nAnd the Food and Drink Federation, a body representing food manufacturers, says the most complex challenge is around trying to get a trade deal with Europe that satisfies what are called \"rules of origin\". \nUK manufacturers use a mixture of domestic and internationally-produced ingredients, which would not be allowed under rules included in recent EU trade deals.\nThe government has a huge task ahead to establish the UK's place in the world after leaving the EU. \nMinisters have to work out what the government's slogan \"Global Britain\" actually means. \nThe traditional role of providing a transatlantic bridge between Europe and the US will be put to one side. \nInstead, ministers must develop a more independent foreign policy. That could mean less automatic support from the UK for the US, as it focuses more on domestic issues and less on its relations with other countries.\nIt will mean a new relationship with European allies, not through EU structures, but through smaller existing groups. These include the E3, an informal group made up of the UK, Germany and France, which has worked together on issues like relations with Iran. \nThe biggest foreign policy challenge will be how to navigate a path between an increasingly stronger China and a defensive US, without the protective membership of the EU. \nTo that end, Boris Johnson has ordered what he calls an 'integrated review\" of the UK's security, defence and foreign policy which is expected to report later this year. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe protesters who turn up on Westminster's College Green are a lonely bunch these days. \nEven the most ardent fan of the EU would have to admit that the heat has gone out of the passionate, and often vicious, political fight of the last few years. \nThe challenge for Mr Johnson is now to show to the public that all the disruption, all the arguing, was actually worth it. \nThat will not be easy.

This gave the Leave side 52%, compared with 48% for Remain. \nThe EU is an economic and political union involving 28 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. \nThe UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and it will be the first member state to withdraw. \nAfter the UK formally leaves the EU on 31 January 2020, there is still a lot to talk about and months of negotiation will follow.\nWhile the UK has agreed the terms of its EU departure, both sides still need to decide what their future relationship will look like.This will be worked out during the transition period (which some prefer to call the implementation period), which begins immediately after Brexit day and is due to end on 31 December 2020.\nDuring this 11-month period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's rules and its trading relationship will remain the same. \nThe transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while a new free trade agreement is negotiated. \nThis is needed because the UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of the transition. A free trade agreement will allow goods to move around the EU without checks or extra charges.\nIf a new one cannot be agreed in time, then the UK faces the prospect of having to trade with no deal in place. That would mean tariffs (taxes) on UK goods travelling to the EU and other trade barriers.\nAside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will also need to be decided. For example:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists the transition period will not be extended, but the European Commission has warned that the timetable will be extremely challenging.\nThe transition period and other aspects of the UK's departure were agreed in a separate deal called the withdrawal agreement.\nMost of that was negotiated by Theresa May's government. But after Mr Johnson replaced her in July 2019, he removed the most controversial part - the backstop. \nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe backstop was designed to ensure there would be no border posts or barriers between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. If needed, it would have kept the UK in a close trading relationship with the EU.\nUnder Mr Johnson's deal, a customs border will effectively be created between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

According to these polls, most Remain (88%) and Leave voters (86%) would vote the same way as in the 2016 referendum. However, those who did not vote in 2016 back Remain by two to one (53% to 26%).\nOne poll conducted since the election, by BMG Research, suggests opinion has not shifted significantly since the election. It put Remain on 52% and Leave on 48%. \nThe lead for Remain is too small to be certain that most voters would prefer Brexit was not happening. However, the evidence certainly does suggest the UK remains more or less evenly divided about Brexit.\nTwo key issues in the 2016 referendum were immigration and the economy. In both cases, Remain and Leave voters still have very different views about what Brexit will mean.\nAccording to research by NatCen, nearly two in five of all voters (38%) think immigration will fall. Just 7% believe it will increase after the UK leaves the EU.\nHowever, nearly half (46%) of those who voted Leave believe immigration will be lower, compared with only 34% of Remain supporters.\nThese figures have not changed much since the EU referendum.\nIn contrast, attitudes towards the economic consequences of leaving the EU have shifted. In September 2016, a few months after the EU referendum, under half (45%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit, while 30% believed it would be better.\nBut in a survey by NatCen during the election campaign, over half (56%) said the economy would be worse as a result of Brexit. Fewer than a quarter (21%) believed it would be better. \nHowever, those who voted Leave are still more likely to say that the economy will be better off (46%) than worse off (21%). In contrast, as many as 84% of Remain supporters believe the economy will be worse off.\nImmigration and the economy will also be important in forthcoming talks about the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will have to decide what rules on immigration it wants and how much it wishes to depart from rules governing what can be bought and sold in the EU. \nConcern about immigration has fallen during the last three years. However, most voters reject current rules which mean anyone from the EU can live and work in the UK, but people from outside the EU must apply to do so.\nDuring the election, nearly three in five (58%) voters told NatCen that EU residents should also have to apply to live and work in the UK. Less than a quarter (22%) said they were against the idea. \nEven among those who voted Remain, nearly half (47%) said they were in favour of this approach.\nIt is figures like these that help explain why the government wants to end freedom of movement.\nMost voters seem keen to keep close economic ties with the EU.\nNo fewer than 86% agree that after Brexit, companies based in the EU should be allowed \"to sell goods and services freely in Britain in return for allowing British companies to sell goods and services freely in the EU\".\nTo realise that ambition, it is likely that the regulations on what can be made and sold in the UK will have to remain fairly similar to those in the EU.\nVoters are not always opposed to keeping to EU rules, particularly when those rules might be thought to favour consumers.\nEven after Brexit, NatCen's research found nearly three-quarters (72%) want UK companies to follow EU rules limiting the cost of using a mobile phone abroad. \nSimilarly, almost four in five (78%), think UK airlines should still follow EU rules requiring them to compensate seriously-delayed passengers.\nAs the UK government seeks the freedom to do things differently, it might well consider that voters could want some things to remain the same - particularly when it comes to their rights as consumers.\nThis analysis piece was More from Sir John Curtice is professor of politics, Strathclyde University, and senior research fellow at commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. and \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51212714", "title": "Sweets and football: How the UK celebrated joining Europe", "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:20:26 GMT", "summary": "A look at the 11-day \"Fanfare for Europe\" that followed British entry into the EEC in 1973.", "story": "A light show in Downing Street and a new 50p coin will be among official events marking Brexit on Friday. \nDespite some accusations of triumphalism, the tone marks a more muted contrast with British entry into the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973. \nA new 50p was also minted back then - featuring nine interlocking hands to reflect the newly-expanded membership of the club. \nBut Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath went further, and organised 11 days of government-subsidised cultural events. \nBeginning three days after entry on 1 January, the \"Fanfare for Europe\" featured hundreds of musical, artistic, and sporting events. \nAs with Brexit in 2020, the occasion was not immune from political wrangling. \nMr Heath, a Europhile who had long dreamed of witnessing British entry into the EEC, known as the Common Market, took an active role in certain events. \nHe attended a special gala at the Royal Opera House, and personally presented prizes to British and EEC children who won free holidays in an essay competition.\nHe also brought down the starting flag on a rally of dozens of vintage cars from London to Brussels.\nThe decision to put himself at the centre of events did not come without risks, however, as some events saw protests from anti-market protestors. \nIn fact, the prime minister was stink-bombed as he arrived for the gala in Covent Garden alongside the Queen. \nIn total, seven government departments and two specially-created temporary committees were involved in devising the programme for the Fanfare.\nCrossbench peer and Arts Council chairman Lord Goodman led a committee responsible for cultural events - while a second committee, chaired by the Conservative peer Lord Mancroft, took the lead in other fields. \nCultural events dominated the schedule, with 25 art exhibitions on European themes arranged, as well as scores of concerts. \nThe Berlin Philharmonic were brought over for special concert, whilst groups such as the Kinks, Steeleye Span and Slade all had gigs. \nAt the Victoria and Albert Museum, an exhibition was put together featuring artwork loaned especially by each of the six existing EEC members. \nDenmark sent two Bronze Age wind instruments, while the Italian donation, a bust of Brutus by Michelangelo, was described in the programme as a \"highly expressive tribute to the fight against tyranny\".\nMeanwhile France, which had twice vetoed British entry into the EEC in the 1960s, sent a 17th Century depiction of card cheating by painter Georges de la Tour. \nHowever an attempt to bring the Mona Lisa to London reportedly failed when a request to send the Rosetta Stone to the Louvre in exchange was turned down. \nAmong the headline events was a special football match at Wembley, which pitted players from the six existing EEC countries against a team composed of players from the UK, Ireland and Denmark, who joined together in 1973. \nThe 'Three', selected by England World Cup-winning manager Sir Alf Ramsey, ran out 2-0 victors with goals from Danish international Henning Jensen and Coventry City striker Colin Stein.\nAmong the British stars who featured were England's Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton, and Scottish international Peter Lorimer. \nGerman international Franz Beckenbauer also took part, although he was taken off at half-time. \nDespite the star appearances, however, ticket sales were slow and only 36,500 fans turned up, not much more than a third of Wembley's capacity at that time.\nLack of enthusiasm did not stop there, with Lord Mancroft admitting to the Times three months before events began that some councils had refused to take part.\n\"But we found a much greater number, who, while not being very enthusiastic, have accepted that British entry is going to happen and are prepared to join us and do their best,\" he added. \nTaxpayer support of \u00a3350,000 - around \u00a34.2m in today's terms - also proved contentious, despite protestations from Lord Goodman to MPs scrutinising expenditure that it was a \"trivial sum of money for this festival\".\nLabour leader Harold Wilson - who had opposed the Conservative deal taking the UK into the EEC - called government subsidies \"an outrage\".\nHe suggested that instead of the festivities, it would have been more appropriate to give all British workers a bank holiday. \nApart from in Scotland, the UK was the only EEC country not to offer its workers time off on New Year's Day at the time it joined - but the first day of the year had long been marked by widespread absenteeism in certain sectors. \nPerhaps recognising the inevitable, Ford and British Leyland were among the firms that voluntarily gave staff that day off in 1973. \nNew Year's Day became a UK-wide bank holiday in 1974. \nEdward Heath also had to fend off accusations that the Fanfare was a propaganda exercise, dominated by highbrow events concentrated in London.\nThings were hardly helped by the timing of Britain's EEC entry, which took place in the midst of a government-imposed pay freeze to control inflation. \nJim Callaghan, a future Labour PM then serving as the party's shadow foreign secretary, made the link when the issue was debated in the Commons. \n\"It might be thought that because the government cannot give the people bread, they are giving them circuses,\" he quipped. \nDespite the differences with today's circumstances, Brexit has bridged the decades with the Fanfare in one respect - with the revival of one element of the EEC festivities that went rather awry back in 1973. \nA 1973 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, entitled \"Sweets\", was brought to an abrupt end on its final day when the display of European confectionary was devoured by schoolchildren who had overwhelmed a guard. \nThe exhibition was recreated to coincide with the expected date of the UK's exit in March last year, alongside a specially-commissioned film from German artist Ulla von Brandenburg. \nAhead of its opening, she told the gallery the exhibition offered the chance to reflect on both the political and culinary tastes of the two periods. \n\"What is funny is that a lot of sweets didn't change,\" she said at the time. \n\"The world has changed a lot since 1973, but not the sweets.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51021028", "title": "Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 11:52:43 GMT", "summary": "The rise of Euroscepticism - a political creed for so long ignored or ridiculed by the Westminster establishment.", "story": "It used to be a fringe obsession ignored by the political mainstream. \nSo how did Euroscepticism conquer Britain?\nThe word \"Eurosceptic\" was not coined until the 1980s, to describe a rebellious band of Tory MPs, but hostility to closer European integration dates back decades.\nBritain voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Economic Community in 1975, but never joined the currency or the passport-free area, and a substantial body of public opinion had always believed the country was better off out.\nThey rarely had a voice at Westminster. The campaign to leave the European Union - via another referendum - took root outside of Parliament. It was pursued by mavericks, political outcasts and a fair few eccentrics.\nIt was a long, and often thankless, battle - and it began before Britain had even joined.\nWith World War II fresh in the memory, and the Empire rapidly disintegrating, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan decided Britain's future lay in Europe.\nHis, in the end unsuccessful, application to join the six nation European Economic Community enraged many in his party, who saw it as a betrayal of the Commonwealth nations, which were Britain's biggest trading partners at the time.\nMany in Labour viewed the EEC as a business-led Tory con trick. Both sides fretted about the loss of independence and status it would seem to entail.\nMost opponents of membership tended to be on the far left and right fringes, but there were big, mainstream voices in both the Labour and Tory parties that were also firmly against it. \n\"I'm not very keen on the Common Market. After all, we beat Germany and we beat Italy and we saved France and Belgium and Holland. I never see why we should go crawling to them,\" said former Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee.\nThe first substantial campaign against British membership - The Anti-Common Market League - was formed in June 1961, by a bunch of disgruntled Conservatives. \nIt had broadened out into a cross-party effort by the following September, when it staged a mass anti-Common Market rally at London's Albert Hall.\nEuroscepticism has always attracted colourful characters. Major Oliver Smedley was a decorated World War II veteran and pirate radio entrepreneur, who was cleared of murder in 1966 after he shot a business rival in a dispute over a transmitter.\nMaj Smedley, who quit the Liberal Party after being slow-handclapped at the party's conference, believed joining the \"protectionist\" EEC would lead to higher food prices and poverty.\nHis Keep Britain Out campaign merged with the Anti-Common Market League in the late 1960s and is still going today, as Get Britain Out. \nOn 1 January 1973, Britain officially joined the EEC, at the third attempt. Opinion polls suggested the nation was divided over Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath's decision. Eurosceptics, on the left and right, stepped up their calls for a referendum.\nThere was widespread disbelief in Eurosceptic circles when voters opted by 67% to 33% to stay in the Common Market, in the UK's first nationwide referendum.\nThe vote had been called by Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson largely as a way to paper over the huge divisions in his party over Europe. \nSome polls suggested the unlikely alliance of Tony Benn, from the Labour left, and Enoch Powell, Ulster Unionist and former Tory, who emerged as the chief spokesmen for the No campaign, was a turn-off for voters. \nWhatever the case, the defeat was a body blow to the Eurosceptics. Many lean years followed, with poorly attended meetings, lost election deposits and pamphlets few read, even if polls suggested Britain was turning against the EEC. \nLabour campaigned to leave the EEC at the 1983 general election but went down to a heavy defeat and the Eurosceptics in its ranks were pushed to the margins.\nMargaret Thatcher's Bruges speech was the moment Euroscepticism in the UK was reborn and it arguably set Britain on the path to Brexit.\nShe had travelled to the Belgian city to fire a warning shot across the EEC's bows, over its ambitions to move beyond the single market to create a \"social Europe\", with new employment rights and regulations on business, as well as a single currency.\nIt all smacked of socialism by the backdoor to Mrs Thatcher, rather than the free trade area she had enthusiastically championed in 1975.\nBritain's \"destiny is in Europe\", she stressed, but added: \"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.\"\nIt was a riposte to a speech Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, had given to the Trades Union Congress 12 weeks earlier.\nWhich brings us to...\nIn 1975, Britain's best-selling newspaper, The Sun, had told its readers: \"We are all Europeans now.\"\nIn November 1990, it called on its front page for them to stick two fingers up to Jacques Delors - \"Up, Yours Delors\", said the headline - to \"tell the French fool where to stuff his ECU\" (the ECU was the forerunner of the euro).\nThe rest of the right-wing tabloids were now just as Eurosceptic, if not as blunt. But calling for Britain to leave was still strictly off limits in the mainstream media and politics.\nIt began in a dusty office at the London School of Economics. European history lecturer Alan Sked founded the Anti-Federalist League to \"prevent the UK becoming a province of a united European superstate\".\nThe tiny group, which included Nigel Farage among its early recruits, campaigned against the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn the EEC into the European Union, including a commitment to \"ever closer union\" and the free movement of people.\nThe League soon changed its name to the more voter-friendly UK Independence Party and began calling for Britain's exit from the EU. But it was largely ignored, or ridiculed, by the media, and struggled to make an impact.\nMr Sked, a former member of the Liberal Party, left in 1997, complaining that it had been taken over by right wingers and racists.\nConservative MPs fought a guerrilla war against their own government's support for the Maastricht Treaty. Some of the Maastricht rebels would go on to play leading roles in the 2016 Brexit campaign (before receiving knighthoods), including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin. \nBut even the most Eurosceptic among them never spoke publicly about leaving the EU at this stage, preferring instead to talk about \"reform\" or, if they were in a daring mood, \"fundamental reform\".\nThe mercurial billionaire, and father of Conservative minister Zac, founded the Referendum Party to campaign for Britain to be given another say on Europe.\nHe spent more than \u00a37m on the party's 1997 general election campaign - including a glossy promotional video mailed to five million households - for a 2.6% share of the vote. \nIn many ways, Nigel Farage owes his political career to a Belgian mathematician. In 1878, Victor D'Hondt devised the system of proportional representation adopted by the UK in 1999 for elections to the European Parliament.\nUKIP and other smaller parties, like the Greens, had stood no chance under first-past-the-post. Suddenly the door to a seat in Brussels was open, and Mr Farage and two other UKIP candidates were first through it, despite receiving virtually no national media coverage for their campaign. \n\"Brexit wouldn't have happened without proportional representation or, ironically, the European Parliament,\" Mr Farage told Channel 4 News this week.\n\"It was actually getting elected to that place that gave us some kind of platform,\" he added, and UKIP used the \"wherewithal\" provided by the Brussels parliament to \"build a UK political movement\".\nThe same year saw the arrival of Dominic Cummings, future mastermind of the Vote Leave campaign, on the Eurosceptic scene, as campaign director of anti-euro pressure group Business for Sterling. \nUKIP was still struggling for public recognition and credibility when, out of nowhere, Robert Kilroy-Silk joined it.\nA household name, due to his long-running daytime talk show, Kilroy, he had been fired by the BBC over comments he'd made in a newspaper column.\nMr Kilroy-Silk's brief UKIP adventure - and the massive injection of cash that came with it, from self-made Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes - helped the party to the best results in its history in the 2004 European elections, gaining 2.6 million votes. UKIP - and its call for a referendum on leaving the EU - were now on the political map.\nIt's possible to track the rise of UKIP in insults directed at its members by Conservative leaders, as they tried in vain to stem the flow of supporters to Nigel Farage's \"People's Army\".\nIn 2004, Michael Howard - who would go on to be a Brexit supporter - called them \"extremists\" and \"cranks\".\nTwo years later David Cameron refused to apologise for labelling them \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\", handing UKIP a publicity coup and a rallying cry.\nSome 81 Tory MPs defied Prime Minister David Cameron to vote in favour of an EU referendum in October 2011. \nMr Cameron easily won the vote, with Labour support, but leaving the EU - as one of a range of options - was now firmly on the agenda at Westminster. Mr Cameron would announce plans for a referendum just under two years later.\nNigel Farage had finally found a way to turn the latent Euroscepticism in large sections of the British public into electoral gold, as concerns about the flow of migrants from new EU states were added to the traditional cry for freedom from bossy Brussels bureaucracy.\nUKIP seemed unstoppable in 2014. It topped the poll in the European elections, with a massive 3.8 million votes - and made further gains in local elections to consolidate the breakthrough it had made in 2012. \nThen Mr Farage turned up the heat on David Cameron by unveiling two Tory defectors, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, in quick succession, with the threat of more to come. \nDavid Cameron had been stunned by the number of Conservative MPs who had joined the Leave campaign, not realising the depth of Eurosceptic feeling in his party.\nBut he had not expected Boris Johnson to join the cause. The official Leave campaign wanted nothing to do with Nigel Farage over fears he would scare off floating voters.\nIts recruitment of Mr Johnson - one of the biggest, and most popular, names in British politics - was a game changing moment. Euroscepticism had finally shaken off its reputation as an eccentric fringe movement. \nRecalling UKIP's early days in the European Parliament in 1999, at a farewell press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Farage said: \"We were considered pretty odd. Perhaps we were, I don't know, certainly very eccentric.\n\"And as those years went by I did begin to wonder whether I might become the patron saint of lost causes.\"\nBut now, he added, \"far from being a minority sport, Euroscepticism had become the mainstream, settled view in the United Kingdom\".\n"}}, "business": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51475379": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51475379", "title": "BP boss plans to 'reinvent' oil giant for green era", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:15:16 GMT", "summary": "The oil giant's new chief executive Bernard Looney said BP must be \"cleaner\".", "story": "New BP boss Bernard Looney has said he wants the company to sharply cut net carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner.\nMr Looney said the 111-year-old company needed to \"reinvent\" itself, a strategy that will eventually include more investment in alternative energy.\nBP will have to fundamentally reorganise itself to help make those changes, said Mr Looney, who took over as chief executive last week.\nIt follows similar moves by rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell and Total.\nMr Looney said: \"The world's carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero.\n\"Trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world's energy system.\"\n\"This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity.

Will it be through offsetting? When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?\n\"What is the scale and schedule for the renewables investment they barely mention? And what are they going to do this decade, when the battle to protect our climate will be won or lost?\"\nHowever, Climate Action 100+, a group of large investors that are trying to put pressure on major greenhouse gas emitters to clean up their act, said the BP announcement was \"welcome\".\n\"We need to see a wholesale shift to a net zero economy by 2050,\" said Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the action group's steering committee.\n\"This must include oil and gas companies if we are to have any chance of successfully tackling the climate crisis,\" said Ms Pfeifer, who is also chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.\nShe said that Climate Action 100+ investors, who have already been putting pressure on BP, will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change.\n\"This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses, and ensuring its lobbying activity supports delivery of the Paris Agreement,\" she said.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51474769": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51474769", "title": "Petrol and diesel car sales ban could start in 12 years, says Shapps", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:55:28 GMT", "summary": "Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tells the BBC a sales ban could be brought forward again.", "story": "The UK's planned ban on sales of new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars could start as early as 2032, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.\nLast week, the government sparked industry concern after bringing the date forward from 2040 to 2035 in a bid to hit zero-carbon emission targets.\nBut Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 5 live it would happen by 2035, \"or even 2032,\" adding there would be consultation.\nThe SMMT car trade body had previously said the 2035 figure was \"concerning\".\nThe government is setting out its proposals in the run-up to \nThe summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow.

At the moment, they give drivers the best of both worlds.\"\nThe Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has already the original target date of 2040 for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was not commenting for the moment. Last week, after the ban was brought forward to 2035, SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the move was \"extremely concerning\".\nHe said: \"Manufacturers are fully invested in a zero emissions future...

The top-end Galaxy S20 also introduces a 100x zoom camera.\nThe firm also confirmed a new foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip. It uses \"folding glass\" in its display and small fibres in its hinge to protect itself from damage.\nSeveral rivals plan their own handset launches over the coming weeks.\nBut the spread of the coronavirus poses a threat to production.\n\"The virus is going to affect the supply chain,\" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.\n\"Although Samsung has diversified its manufacturing into places way beyond China, there will still be components in these phones sourced from China.\"\nMany factories in the country have delayed re-opening after its New Year break because of fears the virus could spread in the workplace. China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand.\nSamsung has suffered less impact than many of its rivals to date because it makes most of its handsets in Vietnam, and sells relatively few phones to Chinese consumers.\nBut TrendForce - a research firm - still predicts the virus will cause the South Korean firm to produce 3% fewer devices than it might have in the current quarter.\n\"I'm expecting that to mean some delays in delivering the new handsets,\" added Francisco Jeronimo an analyst at IDC.\nSamsung told the BBC it was making its \"best effort to minimise impact on our operations\".\nThere are three S20 variants:\nThe S20 Ultra's camera module is thicker than that of the others to incorporate a periscope. This uses a prism to reflect light into the device's interior, allowing the wide-angle option to feature a longer lens and bigger sensor.\nAlthough it is possible to take 108MP shots, owners are expected to let the phone automatically merge groups of nine pixels into one most of the time. This aids low-light photography.\nThe 100x \"super-resolution zoom\" facility uses the lower-resolution 48MP camera. Machine-learning techniques stitch together pixels from up to 20 different frames to achieve a better result than would be possible via a simple digital zoom.\nIt allows Samsung to boast double the zoom range of Huawei's competing P30 handset, although one expert questioned how usable it was in practice.\n\"The 100x zoom ends up with a quite blurred image, so I don't think people will turn to it that often\", commented Mr Jeronimo.\n\"But it should have a wow factor when shown off in stores. And at 20x to 30x you can get a good photo.\"\nThe phones also introduce Single Take mode. Samsung said this uses artificial intelligence to simultaneously take a mix of stills and videos via the various cameras, giving the owner a selection to choose from after the fact.\n\"We want to make sure consumers can really enjoy the moment in front of them... and don't have to worry about adjusting settings,\" explained product manager Mark Holloway.\nThe phones are also among the first to be capable of recording in 8K resolution - four times as many pixels as 4K and 16 as many as 1080p high definition. \nMost people do not yet own 8K screens, but Samsung suggests this offers a degree of future-proofing as well as the ability to extract high-quality stills from the footage.\nJan-Dec 2019\n\"Both the new tech and the more user-friendly user interface should help with how Samsung's camera functionality is perceived,\" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies.\n\"Its results in the past were not quite on a par with competitors, perhaps signalling it wasn't leveraging software to do the heavy-lifting as much as the likes of Apple and Google. This time round there is definitely more 'AI' involved.\" \nSamsung is pitching gaming as one benefit of having 5G connectivity, suggesting that lower latencies will mean that players can see and react to events in online titles split-seconds faster than if they were on 4G.\nThe phones' Google Duo app also displays video chats in higher quality when on 5G.\nNetworks are still in the early stages of deploying the technology, but one consultant said it was still wise to offer it as standard.\n\"Consumers are holding on to their phones for three or four years, and don't want something that will become obsolete in that lifetime,\" said Ben Wood.\n\"And this launch represents a unique opportunity: Huawei is on the back foot as it doesn't have access to Google's suite of apps, and Apple currently doesn't have a 5G-capable iPhone.\"\nThe Z Flip, however, is limited to 4G.\nSeveral of its features - including a clamshell design with a small display on the outside and a 6.7in foldable screen on the inside - \n.\nIt represents the firm's second attempt at a foldable after the troubled launch of the Galaxy Fold tablet-phone hybrid.\nThis time round, the concept is a tall-screened phone that can be used one-handed when opened, and made wallet-sized when closed. \nThe hinge mechanism has also evolved.

The project has encountered numerous problems, with a review warning costs could double to as much as \u00a3106bn.\nBut HS2 is far from alone when it comes to projects that have gone over their initial budget.\nHere are three very different examples.\nCrossrail - a rail line running through central London - was meant to open in December 2018. But after a series of delays, the line is not expected to fully open until mid-2022.\nThe service, between Berkshire and Essex, via central London, is now set to cost \u00a318.25bn - more than \u00a32bn over the original budget.\nAlthough the work on the 26 miles of new tunnels was completed in 2015, the project has been hit by software problems with the new signalling system.\nAt the same time, work on the Bond Street and Whitechapel stations has taken much longer than originally planned. Crossrail said Bond Street's opening had been delayed \"because of design and delivery challenges\".\nFor example, the wrong mix of concrete was poured into the station in 2012, which had to be replaced.\nLast year, a report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee found an \"unacceptable\" lack of accountability over the delays, although the Department for Transport rejected this claim.\nUniversal credit, the government's plan to change the benefit system by replacing six existing payments, suffered numerous early setbacks. \nThese included an IT system that struggled to cope and was prone to crashing. \nIn 2013, the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises public spending for Parliament - found almost three-quarters of the cost of setting up universal credit had gone on the IT system, with significant sums written off.\nOne problem with the IT system, identified by the NAO, was that it couldn't identity potential benefit fraud. This meant staff had to carry out multiple manual checks, which took up a lot of time.\nThe issues with the IT system led to the postponement of the national rollout of the scheme. Universal credit is not expected to be fully live until September 2024, adding \u00a3500m to the overall cost.\nThe Scottish Parliament building opened its doors in 2004, with a hefty price tag.\nProblems around the cost, design and delivery eventually led to a public inquiry, led by Lord Fraser, involving 66 witnesses.\nThe building was three years late and the cost had spiralled to \u00a3414m, more than 10 times the original 1997 estimate.\nJohn Campbell, the counsel to Lord Fraser's inquiry, said the scheme had suffered a management failure of \"gigantic proportions\", with civil servants, politicians and the construction managers all to blame.\nWhen he delivered his verdict, Lord Fraser said there was no single \"villain of the piece\" but he was astonished ministers had been kept in the dark over cost increases.\nHe also said it was far too late in the day before anyone appreciated the scale and complexity of the proposed design.\n\"It verges on the embarrassing to conclude, as I do, that virtually none of the key questions about construction management were asked,\" he wrote.\nThe initial \u00a340m estimate \"never had any basis in reality\" and quality had been prioritised over cost throughout, according to the report.\nIn a separate report, Audit Scotland said lessons must be learnt. It said much greater care should be taken in choosing contracts and that project risks must be better understood.  \nHistorically, most major governments projects haven't delivered on the promises of their initial cost-benefit analysis, according to a 2013 National Audit Office (NAO) report.\nThe NAO blamed \"over-optimism\" and said many projects started off with unrealistic assumptions about the time, costs and risks involved.   \nBut this problem isn't unique to the UK, according to Nick Davies from the independent Institute for Government think tank.\n\"Nine out of 10 mega-projects around the world (where costs are over \u00a31bn) go over time and over budget,\" he says.\nMeg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, a group of MPs that examines how government spends public money, says: \"There's often a lot of political pressure to make an early announcement and this means it's a bit of a back of an envelope when it comes to initial costings.\"\nChanges in ministers and senior civil servants can also add to the problem, according to Mr Davies. \n\"Churn means you lose expertise, especially as it take a good six months to get up to speed,\" he says.\nEven when ministers stay in the same job, projects often disappear from their desks once the initial decision to proceed has been made.\n\"When it goes wrong it's often late in the day,\" says Ms Hillier.\n\"Politicians need to know when something is going wrong at an earlier stage\", she adds.\nIn an effort to tackle some of these issues, the government has created the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA). Run by infrastructure experts, the authority oversees the delivery of major projects.\nLast month, the head of the IPA, Nick Smallwood, said there had been recent successes such as the 30-hour free childcare programme and the cleaning-up of Sellafield and other historical nuclear sites.\nBut he also acknowledged that \"\n\". \nTeaching more people in government how to handle complex projects was one solution favoured by Mr Smallwood. Since 2012, some 2,000 people had received training, he said.\nSo has the IPA's work made a difference?\nMr Davies says government departments have been reasonably positive about the IPA's work and the advice it gives. But to make a real difference, he says, governments need to do a better job at learning lessons from past projects.\n\"If you know that road junctions tend to go over by 10%, that can really help when it comes to budgeting current projects,\" he says.\n\"But it's much harder to do this when it comes to mega-projects, because there are so few of them.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51209050": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51209050", "title": "The clever glass box that reshaped the world", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:53:45 GMT", "summary": "Wardian cases safely took plants across the world, revolutionising agriculture, politics and trade.", "story": "A clever box - designed in the 1830s to help plants survive long journeys - revolutionised much more than botany. \nPicture the scene: south-east China, in the early 1840s, and botanist and plant hunter Robert Fortune is \"much annoyed\" at the paltry collection of plants his Chinese servant has gathered. Clearly, rather than trekking into the hills as commanded, the servant had barely ventured beyond the shore. \nFortune assumed laziness but the servant insisted he'd been told the people who lived in the hills were dangerous. Nonsense, said Fortune, determining to go himself, and rejecting his ship's captain's offer to send crew members for protection.\nAt first, all went smoothly. Foreigners were a rare sight and Fortune drew quite a crowd but it was \"generally civil\". \nAs he later wrote, with \"300 or 400 of the Chinese - of both sexes and all ages - looking down upon us with wonder\", he filled a number of precious specimen boxes. \nSoon, however, Fortune had been deftly pickpocketed and his servant - \"pale with fright\" - was surrounded by knife-wielding robbers. \n\"My poor plants collected with so much care were flying about in all directions,\" he added.\nBut the episode didn't seem to affect the young Scotsman's confidence.\nLater in the trip, he was warned an area he wanted to sail to was swarming with pirates. \n\"Nonsense,\" he said again. \"No pirates will attack us.\" You can probably guess what happened.\nNevertheless, the fortunate Fortune did eventually make it back to Shanghai, where he \"despatched eight glazed cases of living plants for England\". \nHe concluded his subsequent 400-page memoir, Three Years Wanderings in the Northern Provinces of China, by noting with satisfaction the 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy he had transported across the globe was \"in full bloom in the garden of the Society at Chiswick\". \nFortune was employed by those people in Chiswick - the Horticultural Society of London, now the Royal Horticultural Society - and those glazed cases that survived his Chinese adventures had made it a whole lot easier to plant hunt. more information about the programme's sources highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find listen to all the episodes online and subscribe to the programme podcast or 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy.\nSo-called \"Wardian cases\" had been developed in the previous decade, the 1830s, by Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, a doctor from London's East End. \nHe was a fern enthusiast but had struggled to grow them in the polluted city air.   \nWard's invention was simple and, in retrospect, obvious. \nGlass, timber, putty, paint - it was essentially a sealed mini-greenhouse. It let the light in. It kept the soot and smoke out. And it kept the moisture in, so there was no need to water the plants. \nThis was no feat of technology but the result of a questioning mind. It was commonly assumed plants needed the open air. Ward wondered if perhaps they didn't. \nHis ferns thrived. And Ward soon realised he might have solved a problem that had long vexed plant hunters - how to keep their plants alive on a long sea journey. \nPut them below deck, and they suffered from lack of light. Put them above deck, and they suffered from salty spray.   \nAs an experiment, Ward arranged to ship two cases of plants to Australia. \nSeveral months later came a letter from the ship's captain, offering \"warm congratulations\". \nMost ferns were \"alive and vigorous\" and the grasses were \"attempting to push the top of the box off\". \nThe ship returned with Ward's cases packed with Australian plants - again, perfectly healthy.  \nWard published a book about his invention - On the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases - and was confident it would have far-reaching effects. He was right - but not in the way he expected. \nHe thought humans, like ferns, would benefit from being out of the polluted London air and envisaged large sealed greenhouses in which people could convalesce from measles or consumption. \nHe didn't foresee his case was about to reshape global agriculture, politics and trade. \nPerhaps he should have, because plant hunting had never been about only herbaceous perennials. \nThe \"father of modern plant hunting\", Sir Joseph Banks, was keenly aware of the economic potential of moving crops from one colonial outpost to another. \nIn the late 1700s, he turned London's Kew Gardens into a kind of imperial clearinghouse for flora. \nIt was Banks who caused Capt William Bligh to embark on his ill fated voyage on HMS Bounty, which ended in an infamous mutiny. \nBligh was supposed to deliver breadfruit plants to the West Indies, as Banks hoped they'd become a cheap way of feeding slaves. \nThanks to the Wardian case, the process of transporting plants now had wind in its sails. \nBefore, according to one commercial importer, they expected 19 out of 20 plants to die at sea. \nIn Ward's cases, 19 out of 20 survived.\nIt was Wardian cases, for example, that spread the Cavendish banana around the world. That's the variety you see in shops today. William Cavendish was the president of the Horticultural Society. \nWardian cases also destroyed Brazil's rubber industry. \nWith prices high, the British Foreign Office sent an enterprising amateur botanist to the Amazon to sneak out some rubber seeds. They germinated in Kew and seedlings were shipped to East Asia. Brazil couldn't compete with the colonial plantations that grew as a result.\nAnd Wardian cases helped to break China's grip on the tea market. \nWard published his book in 1847, a few years after Britain won the First Opium War. When the Chinese decided to stop accepting Indian-grown opium in exchange for their tea, the British sent in gunboats to change their minds. You can see why: taxes on tea accounted for nearly a 10th of the British government's income at the time.  \nSo the East India Company, which virtually governed the subcontinent on Britain's behalf, decided it needed a backup approach: grow more tea in India.\nThat meant tea plants needed to be smuggled out of China. And there was only one man for that job. \nRobert Fortune had learned on his first expedition that if he shaved his head and wore a wig and Chinese clothes, he could just about pass unnoticed. Suitably disguised, he eventually shipped nearly 20,000 tea plants for his new employers. \nBut perhaps the most significant impact of the Wardian case wasn't bringing plants to Europe from more far-flung places - it was enabling more people from Europe to go to far-flung places. \nWardian cases allowed the cinchona tree to be shipped from South America to India and Sri Lanka. From its bark came quinine, which helped ward off malaria. \nThat made it less scary for Europeans to venture to the tropics; some historians think Africa might not have been colonised without it.  \nAfter all, not every traveller was as blithely impervious to risk as the death-defying Robert Fortune.\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51281233": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51281233", "title": "Blockchain: The revolution that hasn't quite happened", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:11:30 GMT", "summary": "Blockchain was hyped as a secure and cheap way to store or retrieve data, but it is yet to take off.", "story": "Imagine you are out shopping and get to the till but your card doesn't work. It turns out that your bank has had a computer meltdown and none of its customers, including you, can pay for anything.\nBut what if the till had access to a record, or ledger, of the balance on your credit and debit cards that was updated anytime you bought something? \nEven with the bank's systems down your card would still work at the supermarket, because the till itself would know your balance.\nThat is just one possibility offered by a distributed ledger, also referred to as a blockchain. The technology has been around for more than a decade and has been heavily hyped.\nIt sounds pretty handy, but in practice, it is hardly used. So what happened?\nBlockchain has struggled to find a purpose, beyond powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nIn that scenario, the blockchain acts as a universal record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made. The blockchain is a ledger, or log, of those transactions and users on the network collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur. They're rewarded financially for this effort - an enterprise known as \"Bitcoin mining\". \nBut the basic idea, of a ledger of information distributed around lots of different users instead of held centrally, has provoked a lot of interest.\nProponents have long argued it could be a better alternative to traditional databases.\nBut how transformative would blockchain-style alternatives really be? The shop tills example was suggested by Dave Birch, an author and advisor on digital financial services, who has been critical of some proposed blockchain schemes in the past.\n\"I'm prepared to buy that,\" he says, of the tills idea. \"I think there's some value to it.\"\nThere are other ideas out there. Prof Gilbert Fridgen, a financial services expert at Luxembourg University suggests a distributed ledger system that keeps track of certificates and degrees issued by universities.\nNo one organisation would be responsible for it. Rather, copies of the ledger would be held by multiple parties and individuals would be able to check that records of their own qualifications were accurate.\nIt would certainly by useful. In 2018, a BBC investigation showed that there were thousands of fake degrees in circulation, so a decentralised system that tracks qualifications might appeal to employers.\nThat said, Prof Fridgen notes that nothing about a blockchain itself can stop some corrupt individuals trying to add fraudulent information to it. Additional checks are needed.\nIf those trust issues can be solved, then blockchains could have real benefits.\nNews surfaced recently of More Technology of Business of migrants from the Commonwealth who have had their legal status questioned because records were not kept of their being granted leave to remain in the 1970s. In the future, such errors might be avoided by keeping information like this on a distributed ledger instead of relying on the government to look after it.\nSome big businesses have been incorporating the technology into their operations.\nTake shipping giant Maersk. It uses blockchain technology in TradeLens, a new system for tracking customs documentation on goods that are shipped internationally. The idea is that any stakeholder in the process, from a port to a customs authority, can quickly look up details pertaining to a shipment. \nMaersk says that 10 million shipping events are now registered in the system every week. \nUnlike Bitcoin, TradeLens uses a permissioned blockchain, this is a non-public ledger to which access is controlled.\nBut a similar system could be achieved with other technologies such as cloud-based ledger databases that encrypt data and control who can access what information.\nAnother project of interest is the real estate system trialled by the Swedish land registry, Lantm\u00e4teriet. A blockchain was designed to track documents during the sale of a property. The buyer and seller, brokers and banks involved could all take part in and keep track of the sale digitally.\nWhile the trial proved such a scheme was possible, a change in legislation would be needed before the system could be scaled up in the future, explains Mats Sn\u00e4ll, chief innovation officer at the Swedish land registry.\n\"It was never integrated into the production system of the land registry,\" he tells the BBC.\nIn Thailand, cryptocurrency firm Zcoin developed a blockchain-based system so that members of the Thai Democrat Party could cast digital votes for their new leader in late 2018. Instead of having to trust a central authority to count the votes, they were instead collected on the Zcoin blockchain.\nVotes were made at polling stations or via a mobile app, where voters needed to submit a photo of themselves when casting their ballot. \nThese digital votes were also audited by the election committee, a Zcoin spokesman tells the BBC. Zcoin says it is planning to announce a bigger scheme, involving \"millions\" of voters, in the near future.\nThese are thought-provoking ventures, though a debate remains as to whether blockchain is absolutely necessary for any of them.\nSome say that eventually blockchain-style systems will prove to be the most efficient option for organising data at scale. Entrepreneur Helen Disney is one of them.\n\"In many cases there is a cost saving to be made once you've got past the initial hurdle - obviously bringing in any new system is expensive,\" she says.\nWhile blockchain bluster will surely continue, even sceptics like Mr Birch think there are some focused applications that could prove worthwhile. So far, blockchain might not have changed the world - but it has got a lot of people thinking.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376973": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376973", "title": "'I remember the roaches walking across the floor'", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:01:47 GMT", "summary": "When Rob Bernshteyn and his family escaped the Soviet Union, they initially found the US was worse.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive of US software company Coupa.\nWhen Rob Bernshteyn and his family finally managed to escape the Soviet Union, they initially found that the US was worse.\n\"We settled in a pretty tough neighbourhood of Brooklyn [New York, in 1980],\" says Rob looking back. \"You didn't want to be walking round at night unless you were carrying. I mean, this was a rough neighbourhood, very rough. New York was a different place back then.\n\"The apartment we were in, I remember the size of the roaches, an inch and a half, walking across the floor. There was graffiti everywhere when you walked down the street, and you constantly heard the sirens of ambulances and police. All of it was really scary for us.\"\nNow 44, and a successful US business leader, Rob was just six when he and his parents were able to swap Leningrad (today's St Petersburg) for New York. A Jewish family, his parents wished to get away from the anti-Semitism they were facing in the Soviet Union, and also gain the economic opportunity on offer in the US.\nSo risking the wrath of Soviet authorities, his father and mother - both engineers - applied to emigrate. \"It took four years for them to get approval,\" says Rob.\n\"There was a real risk in applying, because if you got rejected you were called a \"refusenik\" and often those folks lost their jobs. Many wound up on the street, and some got shipped to Siberia.\n\"But luckily we were on the list that was allowed to leave, and there was a [Jewish] agency in the US at the time that helped.\"\nHis family arrived in the US with just $1,000 (\u00a3765) and two suitcases, and Rob says he can remember his dad taking him \"dumpster diving\" to try to find discarded furniture that he could patch up and put in their small flat.\nThankfully his parents were both soon able to find work; his father with engineering giant Honeywell, and his mother with the New York Department of Environmental Protection. But Rob initially had a much harder time at school.\n\"It was a really tough school in Brooklyn, and I got beat up pretty badly for being seen as a, you know, communist, and all that,\" he says.\nRob says that things improved as he started to lean English, and he found that he was academically gifted, especially at maths. Home life also got a lot better when his parents had saved up enough money to move out of Brooklyn to suburban Long Island.\nAfter secondary school Rob did a degree in information systems at the State University of New York at Albany. He then began his working life as a management consultant, first with Accenture and then McKinsey.\nIn 2000, aged 24, he took time out to do the celebrated master of business administration course at Harvard University, before going into the software industry. Moving to Silicon Valley he spent a number of years with first Oracle, and then SAP.\nBut ultimately keen to be his own boss, in 2009, aged just 32 he took up the top job at a small software business called Coupa. Set up three years earlier, Coupa makes cloud-based procurement systems to enable companies to more easily buy all the supplies they need, such as laptops and office chairs - or the cleaning firms they employ.\nRob had ambitious plans to expand the firm, but with the global financial crisis still in full swing at the time it was a struggle to secure financial backing.\n\"I pitched to investors three or four times a day, for weeks on end, and no-one was believing me that Coupa could become a multi-billion dollar company,\" he says. \"Some three dozen people rejected me.\n\"Then right before we were going to run out of cash I found a venture capitalist who decided to get behind me more than the company. We got $7m, which valued the business at $15m.\"\nFrom that point on, sales at Coupa have continued to rise steadily, thanks in the main to positive word of mouth. Today, its thousands of clients include sportswear brand Adidas, bank BNP Paribas, drinks firm Britvic, retailer Office Depot and aerospace business Rolls-Royce.\nWith quarterly revenues of more than $100m, and 2,000 employees, Coupa - which floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2016 - now has a market capitalisation or value of \u00a310bn.\nStuart Lauchlan, co-founder of technology news website Diginomica, says Coupa meets \"a genuine business need\".\n\"Great tech matters of course, but it's how that tech is used for bottom line benefit that really matters,\" he adds. \"Bernshteyn last year commented that Coupa had earned legitimacy among enterprise buyers at some of the world's largest companies.

What's going on?", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:17:51 GMT", "summary": "Is Hawes, in the Yorkshire Dales, a template for the future of bank branches and community services?", "story": "In one respect, Hawes - a small market town in the Yorkshire Dales - shares the plight of many rural communities. The last bank in town has closed.\nHSBC moved out in 2016. Last summer, Barclays shut premises which had hosted a bank branch for more than 150 years. It blamed customers' switch to digital banking. Civic leaders said Hawes had been abandoned.\nNow something unusual has happened in this picture postcard town, the home of Wensleydale cheese. A new branch has just opened.\nThis time it is a building society, the Newcastle. It does not have its own building. It is just an eighth of the size of a normal branch and occupies a corner of the community office alongside the local library and Post Office.\nIts size belies some bigger ambitions - a financial services industry trying to work out how to reach customers who are not online, and a community setting a template on how to reinvigorate local provision.\nBranch networks are shrinking fast. There were 3,372 closures by banks and building societies in the four years to the end of 2019, according to consumer group Which?.\nBanks say fewer are needed, as customers open accounts and manage their money via apps. Consumer groups and less populated areas express outrage each time closures are announced.\nSpeak to anyone in Hawes, from businesses and clubs to a selection of its 1,000 residents, and they say the departure of the final bank branch was a blow. The name Hawes means pass between mountains, and you pretty much have to do that on the 17-mile journey to Leyburn to find the nearest Barclays branch. That is not easy in the winter months, even for the most mobile. Most customers accounts were moved to Settle, even further away.\nThe arrival of the Newcastle seems a natural fit. \nHawes - driven for years by John Blackie, a force of nature and local councillor, who died last year - has introduced a community bus service to the nearest railway station, an outreach post office service and even runs its own petrol filling station with a turnover of \u00a32m a year.\nJoe Pilling, the new chairman of the Upper Dales Community Partnership and a retired senior civil servant, says: \"The whole economy of a place like this depends on having comprehensive services. If there is a big gap, people are going to have to go elsewhere. That reduces the chance of other services prospering.\n\"It is important for the shops, it is important for every form of local activity that a building society is here helping to fill the gap left by the banks that have closed.\"\nBarclays has left a free-to-use, functioning ATM here, the Post Office serves the need to process cash and cheques, so the building society - which does not offer a current account - has stepped in to meet savers' needs and advise on more complex financial matters, from mortgages to retirement planning.\nEmma Blades, one of a trio of new staff at the branch says customers \"prefer convenience to rates\". You can find more generous interest on savings from various providers online. They also like a friendly face, she says.\n\"Not everyone is into internet banking, not everyone has a computer. They feel comfortable and relaxed because they know me and I know them. They can open up more,\" she says.\nHer boss, Andrew Haigh, the Newcastle's chief executive, says: \"I do not envisage a time when people do not want to talk to other people face to face for their biggest financial decisions. The challenge for us is how to deliver that in a cost-effective way.\n\"It has to be commercially viable. We are sharing costs, and have a very small footprint. In a town like Hawes it is all about the reputation you build, and you do that over time. We are here for the long-term.\"\nThe society is, he points out, owned by its customers, so it needs to be close to those customers. Another similar branch has just opened in a community centre in Wooler in Northumberland.\nThere is still a lack of options for residents. A lack of competition may mean they are not getting the best deal, but they are not lost in cyberspace. \nBranches like this are overhauling their look, but also their feel. Slowly, the sector is shifting its focus.\nFurther south, in Leeds, a branch of Yorkshire Building Society (YBS) is also changing the way it operates, for a very specific reason.\nIt is one of 20 YBS branches that dims the lights, cuts any music, puts the telephone's ringer on low, and switches off screens for Quiet Hour - the final hour of opening on a Wednesday afternoon.\nSome people, particularly those with autism or hearing difficulties, find the constant bombardment of noise distressing, or at least a distraction.\nOne customer visiting the Leeds branch during the quiet period says it is a good idea.\n\"I've just lost my husband and I find it easy to talk to them. If elderly people come in who don't like noise and bright lights, it is really good to have it,\" she says. \nJanis Hambling, who leads the vulnerable customer support team, says that the quiet hour is designed for anyone who appreciates a calmer environment to talk to the staff.\n\"It is not just the customers, but also colleagues who like it. We just want to remove a barrier for anyone,\" she says.\nThere is a sense of calm in the branch, at odds with the busker outside who has just been belting out, with no sense of irony, The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.\nBut, for something billed as popular, one hour at the end of a quieter day in the week seems a token effort.\nMs Hambling argues that the experiment is still in its early stages, in just 20 of 143 YBS branches.\n\"For now, we want to get it to more branches and learn from it. There are people who are worried about waiting at the counter or need longer to articulate themselves, so we make sure we have a private space in the branch for them too,\" she says. \nEvery individual is different, but those with some mental health conditions or disabilities can find a calmer environment helpful. Noise can prompt anxiety.\nMike Adams, chief executive of Purple, which aims to highlight the spending power of people with disabilities, also argues that quiet hours can be attractive to non-disabled people. He says that they have been introduced formally in a number of sectors, to specifically help those with autism or Asperger's. \nEverything from switching off music to silencing hand dryers in toilets can help people with these conditions, he says. Yet initial trials, in places such as shopping centres, missed the mark.\n\"A quiet hour on a Tuesday morning was not quite working,\" he says. \"Nights can be quite chaotic for these people, so they won't be shopping early after a sleepless night. We are working with them to switch quiet hours to lunchtime or early afternoon.\"  \nAnother change, as businesses with bricks and mortar premises realise they must adapt to survive.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/46401558": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/46401558", "title": "Brexit: Is fishing the next big argument in the talks?", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 15:03:17 GMT", "summary": "Fishing looks like being the first big argument of the UK's trade negotiations with the EU.", "story": "It has always been an emotional issue in the UK's relationship with the European Union. \nFishing: a symbol of the sovereignty that supporters of Brexit say will now be regained. \nThe EU has already announced that an agreement on fisheries is a pre-condition for the kind of free trade deal, with no tariffs or quotas, which both sides say they will try to work towards. \nBut the UK says any such agreement must be based on the understanding that, after Brexit, \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\".\nSo, there could be troubled waters ahead.\nDuring the post-Brexit transition period until the end of this year, fishing will continue to be governed by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).\nThat means the fishing fleets of every country have full access to each other's waters, apart from the first 12 nautical miles out from the coast. \nBut they can't catch whatever they like. EU ministers gather for marathon talks every December to haggle over the volume of fish that can be caught from each stock. \nNational quotas are then divided up using historical data going back to the 1970s, when the UK got what its fishing industry says was a bad deal. \nIt's further complicated by the fact that parts of the British quota have been sold off by British skippers to boats based elsewhere in the EU. \nIn England, for example, more than half the quota is in foreign hands.\nOverall, more than 60% of the tonnage landed from British waters is caught by foreign boats.\nSo, Brexit is a chance for a fresh start. \nOutside the EU, as an \"independent coastal state\", the UK will control what's known as an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), a vast maritime territory stretching up to 200 nautical miles into the North Atlantic.   \nThe government wants to hold annual talks with the EU on access to those UK waters and on quotas. That's what other independent coastal states like Norway do.\nAnd fishing communities in the UK, which were strong supporters of the campaign to leave, are insisting on this basic change. \nBut because UK waters are so important, and so bountiful, the EU is under pressure from its fishing communities to maintain the status quo. \nIt wants the UK to grant the same level of access there is now, with only gradual change envisaged, in order to \"avoid economic dislocation for EU fishermen that have traditionally fished in the UK waters\".\nThe EU also wants to divide up the amounts that each country's boats are allowed to catch in a way that will not be up for negotiation every year, and which cannot be changed unless both the UK and the EU agree.  \nGiven that the UK has left the EU in order to set its own rules, it might appear to be in the driving seat in this argument (or should that be at the helm?) \nBut it's not just about where fish can be caught - it's also about where fish can be sold. \nThis is particularly important, because most of the fish landed by UK fishermen is exported (while most of the fish eaten in the UK is imported). \nIn 2018 the UK exported 448,000 tonnes of fish. The total catch by UK vessels into UK ports was 395,000 tonnes. About 100,000 tonnes of UK exports were salmon (which doesn't count in landings figures). \nThree quarters of UK fish exports are sold in the European Union, and some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - would collapse if they were suddenly faced with tariffs or taxes on their produce. \nThe UK says access to markets should be nothing to do with access to fishing waters, but the EU is already making that link explicit.  \nWithout a deal on fish, it insists, there will be no special access to the single market. \nRemember that a deal on fish would not just affect fishermen (and women), of which there were an estimated 11,961 across the UK in 2018. \nThere were also about 18,000 people employed at fish processing sites in 2016.  \nAnd it's not just about fishing at sea - there are also inland sites such as salmon fish farms, which would be affected by any deal.\nPlenty of other issues need to be taken into consideration, including:\nIt is a complex picture. \nAnd it's worth remembering that fishing is only a tiny fraction of the overall economy both in the UK (less than 0.1%) and in the rest of the EU (some landlocked countries have no fishing fleets at all). \nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, fishing was worth \u00a3784m to the UK economy in 2018. By comparison, the financial services industry was worth \u00a3132bn. \nBut fishing still has political power. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate is only a draft, produced by the European Commission. The language it contains is already being toughened up as member states with big fishing communities have their say. \nThe UK government will also be under enormous pressure not to give ground. \nIf there is any compromise to be found, it would probably involve the UK guaranteeing a certain level of access to EU boats, which is lower (but not much lower) than they have now. \nThe two sides had already agreed, in the political declaration that accompanied the EU withdrawal agreement, that they would try to reach a deal on fisheries by 1 July this year. \nGiven the tight timescale, and the political sensitivities on both sides, it looks set to generate one of the first (but not the last) big arguments of these negotiations.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51364852": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51364852", "title": "Has Airbnb grown a conscience?", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:23:02 GMT", "summary": "Airbnb is the latest US company to pledge it will serve society. Has the corporate world grown a conscience?", "story": "Corey Klein would like to believe Airbnb's recent promise that it will make a \"positive contribution to society\". But the 37-year-old lawyer, who lives directly below one of the platform's rentals, has his doubts.\nLast year, the tech giant spent more than $4m (\u00a33.1m) in an effort to fend off new rules in the city where Mr Klein lives in New Jersey.\nThe bruising battle was eventually won by critics like Mr Klein, who said that Airbnb, if left unchecked, would drive up rents and turn his neighbourhood into a springboard for budget-conscious travellers bound for New York City, just across the river.\n\"I hadn't signed up to live in a hotel,\" says Mr Klein, who sits on the board of the Hamilton Park Neighborhood Association in Jersey City. \n\"The problem is the scale of it.\" he says. \"Both myself and my neighbours were sort of getting squeezed out.\"\nAirbnb, whose website boasts listings in more than 220 countries, has faced similar fights around the world, from Barcelona to Berlin to Boston. Last month, it made its clearest case yet for why Mr Klein and others like him should not be so worried.\nIn a public letter on its website, it promised to do business with an eye towards \"all stakeholders\" - including local communities.\nAmong other steps, the firm said it would put $150m to safety measures, host a \"stakeholder\" day to hear from the public, and offer $100m to local initiatives over the next 10 years.\n\"Our commitment is to make sure that Airbnb does have a positive impact,\" co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk says. \nAirbnb's promises place it at the centre of a broader debate in the American business world asking whether its longstanding focus on earning profits for shareholders has gone too far.\nThe discussion is partly a response to outside pressure from consumer boycotts, staff walkouts and social media shame campaigns. \nRising numbers of investors with social aims and attacks by Democratic presidential candidates - such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders - have added to the heat.\nBut while there have been plenty of calls for reform since the 2008 financial crisis, this time companies seem to have taken their critics to heart. \nLast year, 181 firms signed onto a statement by the influential business lobby, the Business Roundtable, affirming that corporate responsibilities extend beyond shareholders. \nIt was a pointed rejection of a view of shareholder primacy that has served as an article of faith since economist Milton Friedman made it a rallying cry among the American business community in the 1970s.\nThe topic of \"stakeholder capitalism\" was the theme of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos and the subject has continued to percolate in public letters from investment giants, such as BlackRock's Larry Fink and Bridgewater's Ray Dalio.\n\"We're seeing support from corporations themselves in a way that is remarkable when even compared to a few years ago,\" says New York University law professor Tamara Belinfanti.\nThere's plenty of evidence that the old priorities still rule. After the US cut corporate tax rates in 2017, companies used much of the extra cash to buy their own stock - delivering money to shareholders. \nBut as inequality grows and climate change worsens - without a meaningful political response - business leaders are increasingly \"seeing the writing on the wall, that the usual way to approaching business has failed\", says CB Bhattacharya, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh's Katz Graduate School of Business.\nIn recent years, firms such as Amazon, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs have announced a blitz of programmes aimed at improving their environmental footprint, bettering worker benefits, and boosting diversity among staff.\nProf Bhattacharya, the author of 'Small Actions, Big Difference', cautions that the actions promised by many companies don't necessarily live up to the talk.\n\"Unless we see more companies that are actually changing their business models and doing more on the sustainability front, this will only be paper promises,\" he says.\nMr Blecharczyk says Airbnb, which is gearing up to sell shares on the public market, is creating a framework that will help it resist pressure to focus on short-term profit. \nFor example, it will tie staff bonuses to safety metrics and hear from the public via the stakeholder meeting.\n\"We're not talking just abstractly about these important issues,\" he says. \"We're actually saying, here's exactly how we hold ourselves accountable.\"\nThe development of metrics is important, says Sarah Kaplan, professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.  \nBut she notes that the firm has focused on matters - like guest safety - that are in its interest to address ahead of its sale of shares to the public. \n\"There is a very self-interested aspect of what they're doing,\" she says, pointing to recent killings at homes rented through the site. \"If they're going to IPO, they have to manage the risk associated with their business.\"\nPotential regulation, like that in Jersey City, represents a more than $10bn threat to Airbnb's growth, according to research firm Truvalue Labs, which tracks companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. \nAirbnb's stakeholder pledge is a \"good sign\" but hasn't lessened that risk, says Andre Shepley, product manager for ESG Integration.\n\"Sustainability is about outcomes not intentions,\" he says. \"Until we start seeing different outcomes, where there's observably less risk  ... that's when I think the view in terms of investment thesis will change.\"\nBut Airbnb can't be too radical, cautions Prof Belinfanti. \nShareholders coming first took root, in part, because it offered a clear way to evaluate business performance.\nAnd there is a limit to how much control public investors - whose share purchases would fund Airbnb - will be willing to cede, she says.\n\"I'm not sure how much the market can bear,\" she says.\nMr Blecharczyk says he knows that the steps the firm has outlined will not satisfy all of its critics.\n\"There's going to be issues and I guess our approach is, 'Let's confront those issues',\" he says. \"The worst thing you can do is to not try at all.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51364082": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51364082", "title": "Stopping Venice choking on its own pollution", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 11:04:07 GMT", "summary": "We know Venice is drowning as global sea levels rise, but it is also choking on its own pollution.", "story": "It is well-known that Venice is drowning as global sea levels rise because of climate change. Last year, the city suffered its worst floods in half a century.\nLess well-known is that Venice is also choking on its own pollution.\nHundreds of diesel-powered vaporetti - commuter boats or water buses - spew out tonnes of carbon as they zigzag through the city's canals. Zipping to and from the Italian mainland, they ferry the 25 million tourists that visit annually, as well as food, hotel laundry and goods.\nBut some in this climate-challenged city believe they have at least a partial answer to Venice's environmental problems; an alternative vaporetto powered not by diesel but by hydrogen, a fuel that emits only water vapour when burnt and none of the carbon or greenhouse gases which cause pollution and climate change. \nStill, this vaporetto won't be taking to Venice's waters anytime soon. In fact, its fate in some ways mirrors the problems that hydrogen has faced globally as an alternative source of \"clean\" energy.\nFor many decades, hydrogen has been known as the \"magic molecule\", the universe's most abundant element that could work as an alternative to natural gas and other fossil fuels. Concerns about hydrogen's safety and cost meant it never quite took off. \nBut with the threat of climate change now looming large, there are those who say its time has come, not least because the cost of making hydrogen using renewable energy - what's known as \"green hydrogen\" - has started to come down significantly.\nAmong its evangelists is Marco Alver\u00e0, chief executive of Snam, the Italian company that operates Europe's largest natural gas pipeline network.  Green hydrogen is a \"key enabler for a decarbonised economy and [it's] becoming affordable,\" he says.\nLast year, Snam injected a small amount of hydrogen into Italy's gas network, mixing it with natural gas. It was a much-publicised experiment to showcase hydrogen's potential - and convince the public it was safe.\nBut the company's vision is even more ambitious: Mr Alver\u00e0 believes that one day huge banks of solar panels in north Africa could provide the energy needed to create green hydrogen which would then be piped into Europe through Snam's vast natural gas pipeline network. \nPeople would use hydrogen instead of natural gas to heat their homes and cook. Green hydrogen would also power industry because it can generate the intense heat needed by industrial processes such as the manufacturing of steel and cement - industries which are otherwise difficult to de-carbonise. \nWith hydrogen, says Mr Alver\u00e0: \"We have a path that doesn't bet on people changing their behaviour.\" And he reckons it wouldn't be too difficult for Snam's gas pipeline to be adapted to carry hydrogen instead.\nBut critics point out that the vast majority of all hydrogen being produced today is done so from fossil fuels, what's known as \"grey\" hydrogen. That effectively cancels out its environmental credentials. What's more they argue that adapting existing pipelines to carry hydrogen instead of natural gas is an expensive process.\nSo what needs to change for hydrogen to really take off as a clean energy source?\nThe answer requires a quick chemistry refresher. To make hydrogen you need to split water, a process known as electrolysis. Water molecules are made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). By adding an electrical current to water you separate them, getting bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen atoms splitting out.\n\"It's a very simple process. We've all done it at school,\" Mr Alver\u00e0 says.\nElectrolysis requires energy. Solar and wind power are now in many instances cheaper than fossil fuel energy which means that \"suddenly you get a cost of [green] hydrogen that can really compete with other fuels in the economy,\" he says.\nBut Sauro Pasini, a consultant on renewable energy who has spent his career working in the Italian energy sector, isn't convinced.\n\"There are other options which remain more competitive [than green hydrogen],\" he says. \"I don't think hydrogen will play a role in [mitigating] the climate crisis in the near future.\"  Mr Pasini notes that technology for green electricity - and its storage - is already many years ahead of hydrogen.\nSnam's Mr Alver\u00e0 remains undaunted. He concedes that electrification from renewables will play a significant role in decarbonising economies, rising to about 50% of all energy use. \n\"The question is how do we make that remaining 50% carbon-free?\" he says. He wants the European Union to put in place policies that would help bring down further the cost of electrolysers to make hydrogen competitive with fossil fuels.\nIt may all come too late for Venice's hydrogen-powered vaporetto. A prototype called the Hepic, is sitting idle in a shipyard outside the city because Italian law doesn't allow boats powered by alternatives to fossil fuel to sail. \n\"Of course I'm disappointed,\" says Fabio Sacco, the president of Alilaguna, the water bus company which runs Venice's vaporetti, and which developed the Hepic back in 2010 in a joint project with the regional authority of Veneto, at a cost of over one million euros ($1.1m: \u00a3850,000).\nDelays in getting the Hepic approved to sail means the technology, and its commercial viability, remain untested.\n\"I would have liked to see the Hepic sail but the bureaucracy is slow and hasn't kept up,\" Mr Sacco says. \"That said, pollution is a big and serious problem here in Venice and we're not going to give up.\"\nListen to more from Manuela Saragosa on BBC World Service's Global Business programme - \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842", "title": "Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:39:24 GMT", "summary": "Securing a UK-EU trade deal will be top a priority over the months ahead.", "story": "Following Brexit, the UK is free to strike new deals for selling goods and services around the world.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab is on a tour of Australia and Asia, to try to secure some of these deals. \nThe government will also have to negotiate a new trade agreement with the EU as a top priority.\nSo, what is free trade and what deals has the UK already done?\nSelling goods and services to other countries is central to the UK's economy and supports millions of jobs.\nIn 2018, the total value of UK trade was \u00a31.3 trillion and almost half was with the EU.\nUK trade in goods - the products that can be bought and sold - was worth \u00a3840bn in 2018. Of this, cars were the biggest single export at \u00a333.3bn, followed by medicine and mechanical power generators at \u00a324.7bn each.\nBut trade isn't all about goods. Services - the skills which a country provides - were worth almost \u00a3460bn in 2018. Examples include finance, insurance, accounting and law.\nCompanies that sell goods abroad will often provide after-sales services as well. For example, a company that sells or leases power generators may also profit from offering maintenance and repair contracts.\nManagement consulting and technical services were the biggest UK service exports in 2018, worth \u00a381.3bn.\nA free trade deal aims to encourage trade by making it cheaper. It does this by reducing or eliminating tariffs - charges for trading across borders. These deals usually cover goods, but sometimes include services too.\nTrade agreements also aim to remove quotas - these are limits on the amount of goods that can be traded.\nTrade can also be made simpler and faster if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked.\nWhile free trade agreements aim to boost trade, too many cheap imports could threaten a country's manufacturers.\nIn order to protect local car makers, for example, a country could impose tariffs on vehicles from other parts of the world.\nThe UK will need an agreement with the EU to stop new tariffs and other trade barriers coming into force after the transition period ends on 31 December 2020.% of total UK trade in 2018\nDuring the transition period the UK will remain part of the EU's trading arrangements - the single market and the customs union. That means no tariffs, quotas or checks will be introduced.\nThe point of the transition is to give both sides some breathing space while a trade deal is negotiated, and to give businesses time to get ready.\nIf any trade deals are reached, either with the EU or other countries, they will not start until the transition period ends.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has spoken in favour of an EU trade agreement that builds on the deal that Canada has.\nTariffs on most Canadian goods, such as machine parts, have been eliminated. However, there are some additional checks, such as customs and VAT. \nServices, like banking, are much more restricted.\nThe financial sector is important to the UK economy - so getting a deal in this area will be a high priority.\nNeither side wants tariffs and quotas - so that part of the trade deal could be straightforward.\nBut getting agreement around rules and regulations could be much tougher.\nThe UK and the EU currently have the same rules - from the financial help companies are allowed, to the way wine is labelled.\nMoving away from some of these rules might make it easier for the UK to secure trade deals with other countries.\nBut the EU wants the UK's rules to remain similar, to prevent its companies gaining an advantage.\nEven if a trade deal is agreed, it will not eliminate all checks because the EU requires certain goods (such as food) from non-EU countries to be checked.\nTime is also a problem. The transition is due to end on 31 December, and formal trade talks are not likely to start until early March.\nIf negotiators fail to reach a deal, the UK faces the prospect of trading with the EU under the basic rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nIf the UK had to trade under WTO rules, tariffs would be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU. This would make UK goods more expensive and harder to sell in Europe.\nHaving WTO terms would also mean full border checks for goods, which could cause traffic bottlenecks at ports.\nAnd the UK service industry would lose its guaranteed access. Qualifications would no longer be recognised and it would be much harder for workers to travel to the EU. \nThis would affect everyone from bankers and lawyers, to musicians and chefs.\nWhile it was an EU member, the UK was automatically part of around 40 trade deals the EU had struck with more than 70 countries.\nIn the run-up to Brexit, the UK was given permission to copy these agreements. So far, the UK has managed to agree 20 such deals, covering 50 countries or territories. These represent just over 8% of total UK trade. \nThe following deals are expected to take effect at the end of the transition period, according to the Department for International Trade:\nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51325101": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51325101", "title": "What happens to all the old wind turbines?", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:44:58 GMT", "summary": "Wind turbines don't last for ever, and they are difficult to recycle.

Each will be cut into three, then the pieces will be stacked and buried.\nTurbines from the first great 1990s wave of wind power are reaching the end of their life expectancy today. About two gigawatts worth of turbines will be refitted in 2019 and 2020. And disposing of them in an environmentally-friendly way is a growing problem.\nBurying them doesn't sound very green. Can they not be recycled?\nWind power goes as far back at least as 9th Century BC Persia, where sails were used to grind grain and draw up water on the windy Sistan plains.\nScottish professor James Blyth built the first windmill to make electricity in 1887, powering his holiday home in Marykirk.\nHis second powered the Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary in Montrose (later Sunnyside Royal Hospital).\nInstead of using cloth to catch the wind like Prof Blyth and the ancient Iranians, today's turbine blades are built from composite materials - older blades from glass fibre, newer ones from carbon fibre.\nSuch composite materials might be light and strong, but they are also extremely hard to recycle.\nThat doesn't mean they have to go into landfill, according to Don Lilly, chief executive of Global Fiberglass Solutions in Bellevue, Washington.\nMr Lilly has been transforming fibreglass composites into small pellets he calls EcoPoly.\nThe pellets can then be turned into injectable plastics, or highly waterproof boards that can be used in construction, he says.\nMr Lilly has received interest from \"several manufacturers\" for his pellets.\nHe's also developed a programme to track blades throughout their life cycle, and make it easier to recycle them at the end.\nIf we \"holistically think about the end of life, there are simple choices we could make now that could make fibreglass in the blade easier to recycle,\" says Richard Cochrane, professor of renewable energy at Exeter University.\nA second avenue for recycling turbine blades is called pyrolysis.\nAfter first chopping up the blades, pyrolysis breaks up the composite fibres in ovens with an inert atmosphere, at about 450-700C.\nThe process recovers fibres other industries can reuse for glues, paints, and concrete.\nOther products include syngas (synthesis gas) that can be used in combustion engines. And char (charcoal) which can be used as a fertiliser.\nThe problem is significant amounts of energy are needed to activate the pyrolysis, which might limit its environmental usefulness. It has mainly been done at a laboratory scale. Germany's subsidiary of the French recycling group Veolia is researching the technology.\nIn Rotterdam unwanted blades have been put to a different use. The Dutch city boasts a 1,200sq m children's playground called Wikado, with a slide tower, tunnels, ramps, and slides all made from five discarded wind turbine blades.\nDecommissioned blades have also been turned into another playground and outdoor seats in the Dutch city of Terneuzen, two bus stops in Almere, a seat beside Rotterdam's famous Erasmusbrug bridge.\nC\u00e9sare Peeren, an architect from Rotterdam's Superuse Studios is currently waiting for planning permission to turn two 55m blades into a bridge in Denmark's city of \u00c5lborg, he says.\nMeanwhile new rotors are only getting bigger.\n\"Twenty years ago, my colleagues and I used to ask ourselves what is the most powerful offshore wind turbine that we could imagine,\" says Vincent Schellings, who works for General Electric in the Dutch city of Enschede.\n\"We couldn't picture anything much more powerful than a three megawatt (MW) output, but even that seemed a challenge,\" he says.\nMr Schellings recently led the development team for GE's Haliade-X, now the world's largest wind turbine.\nIt produces 12MW - four times the amount he imagined 20 years ago. Its 107m blades yield 45% more energy than previous offshore turbines.\n\"So we are going to see much bigger turbines offshore in this decade, and the reason is size matters,\" says Rolf Kragelund, Danish-based director of offshore wind for the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.\nBigger onshore turbines can access faster wind speeds, higher in the sky. They can produce more energy, meaning you need fewer of them, which saves money on transport, installation and servicing. \nSiemens Gamesa says 20 of its new 10MW turbines, announced last year with 94m blades, could power Liverpool, with a population of half a million.\nBut large turbines bring along their own challenges, including what to do with them when they are no longer needed.\nBigger blades \"need bigger factories, bigger vessels, cables, foundations, and handling equipment,\" says Ray Thompson, global business development head at Spanish-headquartered Siemens Gamesa, one of the world's two largest wind turbine makers.\nLonger blades can make for bigger recycling headaches, too.\nThe composite fibreglass in blades is \"the most difficult, and the most expensive part\" of turbines to recycle, Mr Kragelund says.  And there's more of it.\nThere's some reselling of second-hand turbine components from Europe to the Middle East and Asia pacific, he says. Big data, leading to better maintenance regimes and more reliable components could also mean today's blades might last longer, says Siemens's Mr Thompson.\nRecycling has made more progress so far in the onshore than offshore industry, which is newer, he adds. \nBut while \"there is work being done to find ways to recycle materials from old turbines,\" it \"would be nice to see more design input now, so that's easier in the future,\" says Prof Cochrane. \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51370010", "title": "The women who make argan oil want better pay", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:11:41 GMT", "summary": "Argan is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have, but the women workers want more of the money.", "story": "Whether it is being drizzled on salads or turned into face creams, Morocco's argan oil is the latest culinary and cosmetic must-have. But with sales soaring around the world, concerns remain about the pay and conditions of the mainly female workforce that produces the oil.\nI watch as a group of women each use two rocks, one large, one small, to smash open the fruit to get to the seeds inside a very hard central nutshell.\nThey sit on cushions on the floor of a cool stone house, beside big piles of the fruit.\n\"I want a better job, with a better salary,\" says one of the workers, 37-year-old Samira Chari. \"But there is nothing else. This is my only option.\"\nWe are in the Moroccan countryside, some 25km (15.5 miles) inland from the port city of Essaouira, halfway down the country's Atlantic coast. It is warm and sunny, and lush green argan trees pepper the arid landscape.\nThe women are employed by a business called Marjana, one of around 300 small firms, mostly co-operatives, that now produce argan oil by extracting it from the seeds. The trees themselves, which are up to 10m (33 ft) tall, are found all over Morocco.\nOften called the country's \"liquid gold\", global sales of argan oil are soaring, helped by studies that suggest it has health benefits. Production, which is almost all from Morocco, is expected to reach 19,623 US tons or $1.79bn (\u00a31.4bn) by 2022 up from 4,836 US tons in 2014.\nIn Morocco argan is traditionally used as a foodstuff - a dip for bread or drizzled on couscous - and as a medicine. But the big growth in demand is being led by the worldwide cosmetics industry. In addition to face creams, it is now being added to products like lip gloss, shampoo, moisturisers and soaps.\nThe women who harvest the seeds are more often from the Berber ethnic group, and this is the case at Marjana, where staff manager Amina Bouna says they bring age-old skills.\n\"Only Berber women know how to extract the oil,\" she says. \"It's old Berber knowledge. Otherwise we have all types of women here - young, old, married and divorced.\"\nThe 80 women at the company are allowed to work as much as they like. But despite many working from early mornings until evenings, they normally make less than $221 (\u00a3170) a month, says Ms Bouna - below Morocco's recommended national minimum wage.\n\"But it's better than they stay at home,\" argues Ms Bouna. \"Before, they made the oil at home. Their husbands sold it on the market and kept the money. Now they don't need their husbands' money, as they make their own. It's a win-win situation.\"\nThe workers do get some health insurance and pensions provision, but Ms Chari wants to see wages go up. Divorced, she says she has to work long hours to afford medicine for her daughter. She says if she were paid more, she'd be able to spend more time with her child.\nAs the industry becomes more lucrative, the issue of the women's wages has become an increasingly hot topic. Zoubida Charrouf, a chemistry professor at Mohammed V University of Rabat is one of the leading advocates for higher salaries.\nProf Charrouf, who also helped to fuel the growth in argan oil sales after publishing studies into its health benefits, says that salaries can be as low as $50 a month.\nShe adds that some of the companies prefer to pay taxi and bus drivers to bring tourists to their facilities so that they can sell them the oil, rather than pay the workers properly.\nThe situation has become such an issue in the country that Morocco's minister of agriculture asked Prof Charrouf for help in forcing firms to join industry trade bodies, and commit to paying staff the minimum wage.\nProf Charrouf says that this work has now started near the city of Agadir, 175km south of Essaouira, and is due to expand north. \"The women are not happy, and need help to fight,\" she adds.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture did not respond to requests for a comment.\nProf Charrouf says she is also concerned by the rise of industrial argan oil production, where the oil is extracted mechanically on a large scale, driving down prices. \nOil produced this way can cost as little as $22 a litre, less than half the cost of oil made by the small co-operatives.\nHowever, she adds that she is pleased that cosmetics giant L'Or\u00e9al \nMore from the \nBack at Marjana, 55-year-old employee Khadija Tiktoutj is much less downbeat about her job harvesting the seeds than her colleague Samira Chari. Ms Tiktoutj started working there in 2008, after previously being employed elsewhere as a cleaner.\n\"Argan is a local product, and I really wanted to work with that,\" she says. \"As a cleaning lady, I also did not have health or pension insurance.

And it doesn't matter whether it is a wet year or a dry year. 2017-18 was a wet year, but it didn't make any difference.\"\nA forest can become a source of carbon rather than a store, or sink, when trees die and emit carbon into the atmosphere.\nAreas of deforestation also contribute to the Amazon's inability to absorb carbon.\nCarlos Nobre, who co-authored Prof Gatti's study, called the observation \"very worrying\" because \"it could be showing the beginnings of a major tipping point\". \nHe believes the new findings suggest that in the next 30 years, more than half of the Amazon could transform from rainforest into savanna.\nFor decades, scientists have warned of an \"Amazon tipping-point\": the point at which the forest loses its ability to renew itself and begins to emit more carbon than it absorbs.\n\"[The Amazon] used to be, in the 1980s and 90s, a very strong carbon sink, perhaps extracting two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from the atmosphere,\" says Prof Nobre, who is also a researcher at the University of Sao Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies and Brazil's leading expert on the Amazon.  \n\"Today, that strength is reduced perhaps to 1-1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.\"\nTo put that in context, a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide is almost three times what the UK said it officially emitted in 2018. \nBut that figure does not take into account the amount of carbon dioxide released through deforestation and forest fires.\nAnd after almost a decade going down, deforestation in the Amazon has increased significantly in recent years. 2019 was a particularly bad year. \nBetween July and September last year, destruction was above 1,000 sq km (386 sq mi) per month. \n\"In our calculations, if we exceed that 20-25% of deforestation, and global warming continues unabated with high emission scenarios, then the tipping point would be reached,\" says Prof Nobre, one of the first proponents of the tipping point theory. \"Today we are at about 17%,\" he adds. \nOpinions on when this tipping point could occur differs among scientists.\n\"Some people think that it won't be until three-degrees warming - so towards the end of the century, whereas other people think that we could get [it with] deforestation up above 20% or so and that might happen in the next decade or two. So it's really, really uncertain,\" explained Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at UCL.\nHowever Prof Lewis called the results of Nobre's research \"shocking\". \"It says to me that perhaps this is more near-term than perhaps I was initially thinking.\" \nProf Nobre's theory was based on climate models. The new study is based on real-life observations, which produce more accurate results. \nProf Gatti told Newsnight she wanted to see a moratorium on deforestation in the Amazon to establish whether the trend could be reversed. But that looks unlikely. \nBrazil's president has made his priority for the rainforest very clear: development over conservation. \nSaving the Amazon is, for now, a question of political choice. But the science suggests that choice may not be on offer for very much longer. \nYou can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

Roger Harrabin reports from the second session. \nFlying bananas, fashionable indoor fleeces, carbon allowances and synthetic fuels for aircraft were on the agenda for weekend number two of the UK\u2019s climate change assembly.\nThe 110 members of the assembly chosen to reflect a cross section of society raised a vast array of issues. \nTheir task is to give MPs and the government a sense of public priorities as the UK battles to reduce emissions to almost zero by 2050.\nThe indoor fleece question was a surprise. One participant asked whether fast fashion firms should make fashionable indoor clothes that save carbon emissions by actually keeping the wearer warm. \nThe organisers requested that most participant surnames were withheld from this article.\nThe enquiry is pertinent \u2013 the average temperature of a British home has increased by 6% since the 1970s and a whole generation has grown up considering it a basic human right to inhabit the home in little more than underwear.\nThe trend\u2019s not helpful for a government wanting to reduce emissions from heating.\nAssembly members grappled in small groups with other contentious climate issues such as transport, farming and food.\nOne expert witness explained the radical idea of personal carbon allowances \u2013 that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s given an annual carbon budget to emit CO2. \nIf you overshoot your budget with too much heating, driving and flying, you must buy permits from someone who\u2019s used less than their allowance. It would apply, for instance, to flying.\nTracey, a carer from Northern Ireland, liked the idea. She said her group favoured climate schemes that increased fairness.\nShe told me: \u201cIt\u2019s going to create more equality for everyone, so if you have lots of money, people are probably going to take lots of flights because you can afford it. But you\u2019ll probably end up paying extra for that.\u201d \nAsked whether such a revolutionary idea would be acceptable to the public she replied: \u201cWell, it seemed to go down pretty well in there (the assembly).\u201d\nChris from Oxford had previously expressed doubts about the urgency of tackling climate change. \nBut he\u2019s happy to contribute to the task of choosing the right policies as we head towards 2050.\nChris welcomed, for instance, the chance to interrogate some of the proposals on the sort of synthetic fuels proposed by the aviation industry.\nHe said: \u201cSynthetic fuels seemed like a really persuasive solution \u2013 but then we heard they\u2019re not ready \u2013 just not ready. \n\u201cContrast that with something like heat pumps, and they on Twitter. ready.

I\u2019m the typical person who would change their iPhone every year, car every three years\u2026 just pick up what I wanted from the supermarket.\n\u201cBut after all this (information from the assembly) you start questioning. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because everyone\u2019s going to want to keep the same standard of living - not make massive changes. But we\u2019ll have to. So it\u2019s going to be interesting how we get to that happy medium. If we educate people properly we could be on to something good.\u201d    \nBut can the assembly help produce that something good? Mark from Manchester (not to be confused with Marc) thought that it could, by showing MPs and the government a policy roadmap that the public might accept.\nHe believes a mixture of tax, technology and government rule-making will be needed. \n\u201cI wouldn't mind taxing, because it\u2019s for the greater good. Regulations need to be in place. Something needs to be set so governments can\u2019t overrule things that have been set in stone.\u201d\nBut does he really think MPs will take notice? He\u2019s cautiously optimistic: \u201cI\u2019ve spoken local MPs about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were passionate and they\u2019ve visited (the assembly) \u2026 so, it\u2019s positive!  \nThe next assembly weekend is at the end of the month.

They make planes fall out the sky and bridges fall down. On a more mundane level they trip you up on a badly-maintained pavement.  \nNow Strathclyde University in Glasgow is claiming a world-first with a centre dedicated to a new science of cracking-up.\nThe concept of peridynamics - from the classical Greek words for \"around\" and \"force\" - emerged from the United States at the turn of the century.  \nIt uses sophisticated computational models to simulate and analyse these fissures that can mean the difference between triumph and disaster.  \nBut the director of Strathclyde's Peridynamics Research Centre, Dr Erkan Oterkus, says cracks are not always a bad thing.  \n\"Think about a chocolate bar,\" he says. \"If you want to enjoy this bar you have to open the package.  \n\"To open the package, what you need to do is tear the package. So you need to create a crack.\" \nSo far, so delicious.  \n\"Then your teeth need to split this chocolate bar into smaller pieces. Your teeth are actually creating lots of cracks in your mouth. If you think about it, cracks are everywhere.\"\nDr Oterkus came to Glasgow from Turkey via Nasa in Virginia. His co-director Dr Selda Oterkus is also his wife.  \nThe peridynamics centre is part of Strathclyde's engineering faculty but it is not all bridges, planes and ships. \nSelda explains that they have been working with the Japanese giant Samsung to examine cracking in electronic components.  \nThese cracks appear because of steam in unexpected places.  \n\"The electronic package has polymer components,\" she says. \n\"During storage and shipping these components absorb moisture. Then during the soldering process, when you want to combine the electronic components together, the temperature rises and it creates vapour pressure - it creates a crack.\"  \nShe has a food-based analogy - popcorn.  \n\"It's the same idea. If you want to make popcorn in your home, it has a shell and it has content in it,\" she says.  \n\"And when you heat it, the shell gets broken because of high vapour pressure inside.\"  \nOther methods already exist for studying how cracks form and spread but each tends to focus on a different scale: very small things or quite big ones.  \nThe computer modelling used in peridynamics means it can be used to simulate cracks of any size in often complex materials like composites.  \nA fundamental principle is that the same equation can be applied to a material whether or not it has a crack.  \nOne challenge to which it is being applied is global heating. \nAs the climate warms it is opening shorter shipping routes between the Far East, America and Europe through seas on the edge of the Arctic.  \nThe sea ice on these northern routes can be cracked but ships can crack too. Peridynamics can simulate the behaviour of both as they interact.  \n\"What we know from history, for example the Titanic accident, is that if we are just designing ships without considering the effect of ice impact, it can create big damage to the ship's structure,\" Erkan says.  \n\"By using peridynamic methodology we are trying to simulate what is happening in this particular process.  \n\"We are modelling ice as a material and the ship as a material, and we are trying to simulate what happens when these two different objects are in contact with each other.\"  \nPeridynamics can also simulate how aircraft behave when they are struck by hail or lightning. \nBut it can also be applied to softer objects too. Like us. \nIt can be used to calculate the damage a bullet would do to a human body.  \nThermal flows, whether in an aircraft struck by lightning or a cold glass suddenly filled - and cracked - by hot water can be calculated.  \nThe discipline challenges not just existing techniques, but tenets of physics that have prevailed for more than 2,000 years.  \nThe Aristotelian view was straightforward: to move something you must touch it.  \nThat works but it's not the whole story. \nLet's say you want to smash a wine glass.  \nYou could throw it at the wall. You've touched it and it's moved - that's what's called a local force.  \nOr you could just drop the glass on the floor. You haven't thrown it - gravity did the work this time, without touching it. That's a non-local force.  \nPeridynamics can take account of both types, using the concept of the \"horizon\".  \nNot, in this case, the thing behind which the Sun vanishes at night. In this case it's the term for how near or far away a non-local force can be and still have an effect.  \nThe research centre is engaged in a three-year project supported by the US Air Force to find out how well this horizon can be defined.  \nPeridynamics holds out the prospect of increasing safety by better understanding how forces near and far could affect buildings, aircraft and even our bodies.  \nIn practical terms it could mean the difference between a ship cracking the ice or ice cracking the ship.  \nOr indeed whether that chocolate bar cracks your teeth.  \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24021772", "title": "What is climate change?

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. \nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes.\nUse this form to ask your question: \nIf you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the terms & conditions to submit your question or send them via email to privacy policy.

She held a simple sign, black letters on a white board, that said \"School Strike for Climate.\"\n\"It felt like I was the only one who cared about the climate and the ecological crisis,\" she told the BBC. The 15-year-old was by herself, but not for long.\nWithin a year, her school strike, carried on through all weather, had inspired millions of young people around the world to take to the streets and demand action on climate change. \nAs thousands of students again protest in major global cities, here's a look at what we know about the teenager who started it all.\nMs Thunberg, the elder of two girls, was born on 3 January, 2003. She grew up in Stockholm with her mother Malena Ernman, an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant, and her actor father Svante Thunberg. Her father is a descendant of Svante Arrhenius, a scientist who came up with a model of the greenhouse effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. \nMs Thunberg said her parents were \"as far from climate activists as possible\" before she made them aware of the issue. She persuaded her parents to become vegan, and in 2016 convinced her mother to stop flying, despite her mother frequently travelling overseas for work. \nThey have co-written a book with their daughter called Our House is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis. It is set to be released in March. \nMs Thunberg has Asperger's Syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift and a superpower.\nShe says she first learned about climate change when she was eight and couldn't understand why people weren't taking action. \n\"I remember thinking it was very strange that we were capable of changing the entire face of the Earth and the precious thin layer of atmosphere that makes it our home. Because if we were capable of doing this, then \n\" she wrote in the Guardian.\nIn May 2018, Ms Thunberg won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper. Three months later, she decided to start protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue until the government met the why weren't we hearing about it everywhere?. \nMs Thunberg said her parents weren't enthusiastic about her protest at the start, and told her that she would have to do it without their help. \nAfter she was pictured outside the Swedish parliament building with her sign, the teenager's protests went viral on social media. \nAs support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world, and the message spread with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. \nMs Thunberg travelled to some of the strikes in Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment. \nIn April, she made an appearance at the Extinction Rebellion protests in London, telling the crowd: \"For way too long, the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.\"\nIn September, Ms Thunberg travelled to New York address the UN Climate Conference. She made her way there on a zero-emissions boat in a journey that lasted two weeks. \nThe week of her arrival, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence.  \nDuring her address at the UN, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. \n\"How dare you,\" she said. \"I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? \n\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We will be watching you.\"\nAt the end of 2019, she was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. \nHer message has not been well received by everyone, carbon emissions target set out by world leaders in Paris in 2015. But she has responded defiantly and often with humour.\nAfter her UN appearance, US President Donald Trump appeared to mock her by saying she \"seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future\".\nMs Thunberg then changed her Twitter biography to include Mr Trump's words. She did the same weeks later when Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a \"kind but poorly informed teenager\".\nIn January, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the teenager to most notably prominent conservative voices. His comments came after she called on world leaders to abandon fossil fuels at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nAs for the teenager's schooling, she took the whole of 2019 off school to be able to attend the climate conference in New York and the world's major annual climate summit in Madrid in December.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46459714": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46459714", "title": "What's your diet's carbon footprint?", "published": "Fri, 09 Aug 2019 06:34:55 GMT", "summary": "Check the environmental impact of what you eat and drink.", "story": "Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.\nSwitching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. \nBut what is the difference between beef and chicken?

Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer? \nTo find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.\nDon't cry because you can't play with our interactive. \n                 \nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a \nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely. \nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink. \nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science. \n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained. \nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year. \nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and click to launch the interactive content looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally. \nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process. \nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products. \nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based onUniversity of Oxford study. and Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger.\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality. \nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. \nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user. \nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The  serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants. \nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared. \nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based onEuropean Environment Agency and uses up 65 litres.

This brought nations together for the first time in a single agreement on tackling climate change.\nBut everyone has a carbon footprint. This is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide - which contributes to global warming - released into the atmosphere by people's actions.\nThis can be reduced in a number of ways. through measures like the 2005 Kyoto Protocol.  transport is responsible for 34% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.\nHome heating presents another challenge and opportunity. It is responsible for 21% of a household's carbon footprint. \nThis could be cut by turning down the thermostat, having better-insulated houses and changing to low-carbon heating systems.According to a recent report by a group of international scientists, the current world population is about 7.7 billion and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050.\nThis population growth drives higher demand for food, greater energy consumption and more competition for resources. And it increases the production of the gases that cause global warming.\nAnd According to the United Nations, by a global group of 11,000 scientists, concluded that the world needs to stabilise its population.\nThe study has attracted quite a deal of controversy, but its authors say such action is needed if the world is to avoid what they call \"a catastrophic threat\" from climate change.\nHowever, not everyone agrees about the impact population growth has on climate change. Some argue, for example, that a focus on reducing individual carbon footprints would be a much effective strategy than seeking to stabilise population growth. \nIt is estimated that 26% of global emissions come from food and more than half of this from animal products.  \nThis is because producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Cows and sheep also produce methane - a greenhouse gas.a recent major study,, switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change.\nThey said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. But they stopped short of advising people to become vegan or vegetarian.\nAnd According to a 2019 report by UN experts found that if everybody on Earth cut meat and dairy from their diet, there could be a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production. \nChina and the US are the world's largest emitters of CO2, responsible for 16,000 megatonnes between them a year.\nIn terms of emissions per head of population, the picture is different. The US is still near the top, with 15.53 tonnes. But the UK (5.99 tonnes) is only slightly behind China (6.59 tonnes).\nSo what can a smaller country, like the UK, do to exert pressure for change?\nOn an individual level, consumers could decide to seek out \"green\" products and boycott ones from more polluting parts of the world, says Alyssa Gilbert, climate policy director at Imperial College London.\nThere is also an opportunity for the UK to come up with innovative ideas that larger countries might adopt, Ms Gilbert suggests.\n\"As a country we are small and nimble, so we can pilot ideas around technology and policy in the hope that we can export them to other countries\", she says.\nAt government level, the UK can also use diplomacy, as well as international aid, to bring about change.\nCarbon capture, to remove and store greenhouse gases, already happens naturally. All plants and trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and groundwater.\nSo, planting trees is seen as an important weapon in the fight against global warming. \nThe UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says significant rises in tree planting \"need to happen quickly\" if other targets to cut carbon are not met.\nIt says 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted in 2018.\nThe UK government says it is a University of Oxford study by 2022.\nIn February 2019, the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, became the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning.\nAnother approach, currently being offered by a company in Switzerland, is to committed to planting 11 million trees.

Which makes the news from \n - that it's creating a fleet of ocean-going robots - all the more interesting. \nUS-based OI is a relatively new exploration and survey company. It was founded in 2016. \nIt's made headlines by finding some high-profile wrecks, including \n and the South Korean bulk carrier Stellar Daisy. It also led an ultimately unsuccessful \"no find, no fee\" effort to locate \n. \nOI's strategy has always been to throw the latest hardware and computing power at a problem. The move into Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USV) at scale is therefore the logical next step, says CEO Oliver Plunkett. \n\"We've ordered 11 robots, different sizes. The smallest ones are 21m; the biggest are up to 37m,\" he told BBC News. \"They will be capable of transoceanic journeys, wholly unmanned, controlled from control centres on land. \n\"Each of them will be fitted out with an array of sensors and equipment, but also their own capability to deploy tethered robots to inspect right down to the bottom of the ocean, 6,000m below the surface.\" \nThe boats will be used to search for missing objects, yes; but they'll also inspect pipelines, and survey bed conditions for telecoms cables and off-shore wind farms. They'll even to do freight, says Dan Hook who'll run the robot fleet for OI under the spin-out name of \n. \n\"The 37m will actually take about 60 tonnes of deck cargo. We're looking at logistics services in places like the North Sea, running containers out to oil and gas platforms.\"\nAnd with every USV equipped with a hull-mounted, multi-beam echo-sounder, the boats have the potential to add to the global seafloor database.   \n 21 metres (35 tonnes) long and 37 metres (120 tonnes) long\n 12 knots. 21m - 3,700 nautical miles; 37m - 5,000 nautical miles\n Diesel electric. Reduced CO2 emissions compared with large ships\nArmada will be based in the Southampton area of the UK's South Coast. Or at least, that's where the main control room will be. The boats themselves will be positioned around the world, along with a small number of maintenance staff. \nWhen a mission is instigated, the Southampton operator (or an operator in an identical control centre in Austin, Texas) will drive the vehicle out of port, maintaining command and situational awareness through satellite links. \nWe've already seen something similar come out of the recent Shell Ocean Discovery XPrize, which sought to find a range of innovative seafloor mapping technologies. \nThis was a 12m USV called Sea-Kit that proved its credentials by \n in the Mediterranean and by making \n. \nThe OI difference is to bring scale to the endeavour.  \nThe growth in the deployment of uncrewed vessels inevitably raises questions about safety - similar to the ones being asked of driverless cars. \n\"This is a new industry and we've got to get across the message that this must be done responsibly,\" said Hook. \"It will take time, but I'm convinced that it won't be long before people trust a robot to read the chart and look out for things at night better than a human can. It's going to come.\"\nSince Ocean Infinity's announcement of the Armada fleet, there's been quite a bit of chatter about the company resuming its search for MH370. \nOliver Plunkett describes OI's involvement in the hunt for the missing jet as \"unfinished business\". But he stresses that any further survey work would require some credible new evidence first. \nTo that end, OI is involved with an academic group that is conducting a start-from-scratch re-evaluation of all the available data on the airliner's disappearance. If this new analysis yielded something worth pursuing, could the Armada USVs be involved? \n\"When we set out to design this latest generation of robots, we deliberately built them to be capable of transoceanic operations. So the simple answer to the question is 'yes', they are absolutely the right type of tool for that type of project,\" said Plunkett. \n and follow me on Twitter: \nGEBCO 2030 project\nOcean Infinity\nthe Argentinian submarine San Juan\nthe missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\nArmada\ndeploying and recovering an autonomous survey submarine\nthe first robotic cargo run across the North Sea\n@BBCAmos\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51398485": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51398485", "title": "Fireflies face extinction risk - and tourists are partly to blame", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:35:23 GMT", "summary": "Tourists love the sight of fireflies glowing at night but it can kill the insects, scientists say.", "story": "Firefly tourism is on the rise globally but scientists are warning it may contribute to risk of the insect's extinction.\n\"I spotted a hundred flickering lights, illuminating a palm like a Christmas tree.\"\n\"Our guide waved his flashlight at the fireflies.

They are killing the next generation,\" Prof Lewis says.\nIn Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, the industry has existed for a few decades, but is usually poorly-managed, she explains.\nCongregating Mangrove fireflies live exclusively in mangrove trees along rivers.\nMales gather in huge numbers to attract females, producing the appealing glowing swarms that tourists desire.\nMotorised boats are driven up the rivers, creating water swells that erode the banks, killing the trees where the fireflies live.\n\"Operators also crash boats into the banks to disturb trees and make fireflies fly out, creating a swarm for tourists to see,\" Prof Lewis explains. \n\"There is evidence that even just camera flashes disturb fireflies and interfere with their reproductive success, in addition to the flashlights used by tourists\".\nProf Lewis is keen to emphasise that firefly tourism is often crucial to local economies and should not be banned.\nInstead tour operators and tourists can develop eco-friendly practices.\nTravel blogger Katie Diederichs and her husband, both from the US, chose an eco-friendly tour operator in Bohol, Philippines for their firefly experience in 2015. \nTravelling in a small group at night in kayaks with just one light, the experience was designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, Katie explains.\n\"The amount of light from the fireflies made the mangroves look like Christmas trees - it was really magical. \n\"The male fireflies were flying around, giving the illusion of twinkling, while the females blink.\" \nThe company is run by locals who love the fireflies and want to protect their environment, she explains.\nBut Katie says they witnessed other operators with \"large motorboat of tourists\" passing by them \"sending waves in our direction.\"\nIn Taiwan, the tourist board has invested in sustainable firefly tours and created \"thoughtful and effective\" firefly eco-tourism, Prof Lewis explains.\nSites have regulated guided tours with raised walkways that allow small groups of people to walk through the habitat without trampling on fireflies. \nInstead of flashlights or headlamps that would disturb the insects, white paint illuminates the routes.\nA group of scientists will meet in 2020 to set down guidelines for how to run a sustainable firefly tourism company, Prof Lewis says.\n\"It is very important to not disturb the fireflies' habitat while photographing,\" \nShe regularly photographs the Big Dipper firefly, as well as other wildlife, where she lives in the Catskill mountains in New York.\nWatch where you walk, she says, and be careful with your light sources.\n\"And for goodness sake, please don't ever capture them!\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-51448909": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-51448909", "title": "Oxford University Museum of Natural History gives exhibits fresh look", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 01:30:35 GMT", "summary": "The natural world specimens are being temporarily removed to make way for new display cabinets.", "story": "As part of plans to change the museum's displays for the first time in almost 20 years, the specimens are being temporarily removed as new conservation cabinets are fitted.\nThe museum, founded in 1860, attracts more than 750,000 visitors a year.\nMangers said the refurbishment would \"safeguard our heritage\".\nThe new display, which will include presentations of the \"diversity of life and address the importance and fragility of biodiversity and human impact on the environment\", will be constructed this year.\nThe museum said the cabinet changes were part of longer term plans to \"transform\" the displays in its main court.\nMuseum director Professor Paul Smith said a grant meant they were able to purchase the cabinets which \"meet today's conservation and display standards\".\n\"These are exciting changes for the museum, as we look to provide our large and varied audiences with inspiring, scientifically rigorous and aesthetically beautiful presentations of the natural world,\" he said.\nFounded in 1860 as the centre for scientific study at Oxford University, the museum now holds the university's internationally significant collections of entomological, geological and zoological specimens. \nIt is housed in a pre-Raphaelite inspired example of neo-Gothic architecture and underwent a \nHowever, after the roof was replaced in 2016 sunlight started causing \"rapid and irreversible damage to specimens\", which resulted in a reflective film being added to its glass tiles.\nThe museum will remain open to visitors as normal throughout the changes this year.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51378317", "title": "Mud wasps used to date Australia's aboriginal rock art", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:18:54 GMT", "summary": "Scientists use the remains of wasps\u2019 nests to date Australia\u2019s ancient aboriginal rock art.", "story": "When the veteran telecoms engineer Damien Finch went on a three-week bush walk in Australia's Kimberley region, he became enthralled with its rock art.\nOn his return home, he tried to find out more about these enigmatic aboriginal paintings and engravings.\n\"I couldn't believe how little was known about them; we didn't even know how old they were,\" Damien said.\n\"It seemed disrespectful that scientists hadn't studied this stuff more; it was downplaying the importance of the culture,\" he told BBC News.\nNow, 10 years on and in his 60s, Damien is putting that right.\nHe's approaching the end of his doctoral research on the topic, and \n, has published his own efforts to age the Kimberley's so-called Gwion figures.\nThese feature finely painted human forms, often in elaborate ceremonial dress and carrying spears and boomerangs.\nIt was thought they were painted some 16,000 years ago, but the University of Melbourne investigator has been able to show the likely age is nearer in time - at about 12,000 years ago. \nDating rock art is really hard. Aboriginal artists use iron oxide pigments (ochre) which contain no organic material and are therefore resistant to any radiocarbon analysis.\nDamien has got around this by studying instead the scraps of organic matter stuck on top of and underneath the paintings.\nAnd for this, he's working with wasps. In particular, the ones that build nests out of mud. There's a wide group of these.\nSome will enclose their prey - such as a paralysed spider or caterpillar - inside an earthen box. Before sealing the lid, the wasps lay an egg on the unfortunate victim. The developing larva then consumes the immobile spider or caterpillar, eventually digging its way out of the nest as an adult to carry on the cycle.\nFrom Damien's point of view, when the female wasp gathers her mud supplies she inevitably picks up fragments of charcoal from the Kimberley's fire-prone landscape. And this charcoal can be radiocarbon dated.\nHe's examined the remains or more than 20 ancient nests at various rock art sites. \nMaterial that smothers pigment gives a minimum age; underlying material provides a maximum age.\nA distribution of dates from many locations enables an estimate to be made for when the Gwion style was in vogue. \n\"All this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea-levels. Things like that.\"\nThe paintings he and his team have been working on are, of course, sites of immense cultural significance. \nAll the sampling was guided and approved by representatives from the traditional owners of the artwork.  \n\"We couldn't have done what we did without their active support and encouragement,\" Damien told BBC News.\nHe's hopeful the mud-wasp dating technique can now be used at more locations right across the north of Australia, and perhaps at other rock art locations in the Americas and Europe. \nGavin Broad is the principal curator in charge of insects at London's Natural History Museum. He described the Australian research as \"very smart\".  \n\"There was a paper about this some years ago, but the techniques seem to have improved since then,\" he told BBC News.\n\"In this study, the nests are made by \n, which are wasps of the family Sphecidae, superfamily Apoidea.  \n\"These are well-known mud-daubers in much of the warmer parts of the world.  \n\"However, the real diversity of potter wasps is in the Eumeninae, a subfamily of Vespidae (superfamily Vespoidea).

In fact, it did not admit women until more than half a century after her death.\nAda Lovelace was a leading 19th century mathematician credited with creating early computer programs.\nShe worked with her friend Charles Babbage, an inventor and mechanical engineer, on his proposals for an \"Analytical Engine\".\nThe device was never built, but the design had the essential elements of a modern computer.\nHer notes described how codes could be created for the handling of letters, symbols and numbers. \nShe also created a method for the machine to repeat a series of instructions - a process known as \"looping\", which computer programs still use today.\nGarrett Anderson was the first woman to qualify in the UK as a doctor - but it wasn't easy to get there.\nIn her mid-20s, she enrolled as a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital in London.\nShe attended lectures and observed the male medical students, but no university would let her take the exams to become a doctor.\nHowever, after finding that the Society of Apothecaries couldn't legally refuse her, she qualified in 1865. \nShe subsequently opened the St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children in London and co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women. \nShe was the sister of Suffragist leader Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and campaigned for women's right to vote.\nWiddowson devoted her life to improving people's diets in Britain and overseas.\nIn 1940, when food was being rationed during World War Two, she published a book called The Chemical Composition of Foods that contained details of the nutritional values of many foods.\nShe was one of the dieticians who oversaw the addition of vitamins to food during wartime rationing.\nHodgkin was born in Cairo to a British couple who were working in the north African country during a period when it was under British control.\nBut she herself largely spent her childhood in Norfolk and was educated at a state school in Beccles, Suffolk, \nShe used X-ray technology to discover the structures of penicillin, insulin, and vitamin B12.\nIn 1964 she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry - and is still the only British woman to have done so.\nShe also lectured former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who studied chemistry at Somerville College in Oxford in the 1940s.\nFrom 1976 to 1988, Hodgkin was president of the Pugwash Conference, an international organisation set up in the 1950s to assess the dangers of nuclear weapons.\nProfessor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell is credited with one of the most important discoveries of the last century: the discovery of radio pulsars.\nPulsars are the by-products of supernova explosions that make all life possible.\nProf Bell Burnell was overlooked for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974, even though the award went to two male academics who worked alongside her.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51364382", "title": "The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 21:16:05 GMT", "summary": "When Li Wenliang warned about a Sars-like virus at his hospital in Wuhan, authorities tried to silence him.", "story": "Dr Li Wenliang, who was hailed a hero for raising the alarm about the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak, has died of the infection.\nHis death was confirmed by the Wuhan hospital where he worked and was being treated, \nDr Li, 34, tried to send a message to fellow medics about the outbreak at the end of December.

China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand.\nSamsung has suffered less impact than many of its rivals to date because it makes most of its handsets in Vietnam, and sells relatively few phones to Chinese consumers.\nBut TrendForce - a research firm - still predicts the virus will cause the South Korean firm to produce 3% fewer devices than it might have in the current quarter.\n\"I'm expecting that to mean some delays in delivering the new handsets,\" added Francisco Jeronimo an analyst at IDC.\nSamsung told the BBC it was making its \"best effort to minimise impact on our operations\".\nThere are three S20 variants:\nThe S20 Ultra's camera module is thicker than that of the others to incorporate a periscope. This uses a prism to reflect light into the device's interior, allowing the wide-angle option to feature a longer lens and bigger sensor.\nAlthough it is possible to take 108MP shots, owners are expected to let the phone automatically merge groups of nine pixels into one most of the time. This aids low-light photography.\nThe 100x \"super-resolution zoom\" facility uses the lower-resolution 48MP camera. Machine-learning techniques stitch together pixels from up to 20 different frames to achieve a better result than would be possible via a simple digital zoom.\nIt allows Samsung to boast double the zoom range of Huawei's competing P30 handset, although one expert questioned how usable it was in practice.\n\"The 100x zoom ends up with a quite blurred image, so I don't think people will turn to it that often\", commented Mr Jeronimo.\n\"But it should have a wow factor when shown off in stores.

especially state-sponsored crime - with the seriousness it deserves.\"\nCritics have accused the company of failing to take proper steps to guard information and for waiting too long to inform the public about the hack. \nRichard Smith, CEO of Equifax at the time of the hacking, resigned a month after the breach. He apologised for the firm's failings, ahead of testifying in Congress. \nEquifax was forced to pay a $700m (\u00a3541m) settlement to the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe US regulator alleged the Atlanta-based firm failed to take reasonable steps to secure its network. At least $300m of the settlement went towards paying for identity theft services and other related expenses run up by the victims. In a statement Mr Barr said: \"This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people. \n\"Today we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the internet's cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us.\" \nThis is not the first time the US has charged members of the Chinese military with hacking US companies. \nThe first indictment came back in 2014 and helped lead to a deal the following year to try to restrain such activity. \nBut clearly the US feels that it needs to return to the weapon of public indictments to increase pressure again. \nThe US has become increasingly concerned not just at the alleged theft of economic secrets but also the intelligence risks. \nEquifax was one of a series of large data breaches linked to China - others include health care providers and, most significantly, the theft of data from the Office of Personnel Management which carried sensitive records for almost all US federal employees. \nOne of the concerns for US security officials is how Chinese spies may be able to put together these vast databases about US citizens. \nOfficials say the information could be used to create \"targeting packages\", establishing which individuals have access to sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities which would allow them to be approached. They add, though, that so far they have not seen the Equifax information being used for that purpose.  \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51419210": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51419210", "title": "West Africa's first drone corridor has opened in Njala", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 14:11:55 GMT", "summary": "West Africa's first drone corridor, in Njala, could transform Sierra Leone's healthcare.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51464474": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51464474", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra zoom put to the test", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:00:42 GMT", "summary": "BBC Click's Lara Lewington goes hands-on with Samsung's latest smartphone.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360646": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360646", "title": "Robot blocks leap, roll and climb to work together", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:33:13 GMT", "summary": "Researchers at MIT have developed robots that can self-assemble to form various structures.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51400415": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51400415", "title": "'You're a good dog': Robo-pup helps people with dementia", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 09:51:08 GMT", "summary": "The robot is used as part of a live animal therapy treatment to help encourage emotional attachment.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360645": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51360645", "title": "Portl's 'holoportation booth' lets users beam-in live and life-sized", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:57:25 GMT", "summary": "The projection display is able to show pre-recorded video or live images broadcast from another location.", "story": ""}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51281233": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51281233", "title": "Blockchain: The revolution that hasn't quite happened", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:11:30 GMT", "summary": "Blockchain was hyped as a secure and cheap way to store or retrieve data, but it is yet to take off.", "story": "Imagine you are out shopping and get to the till but your card doesn't work. It turns out that your bank has had a computer meltdown and none of its customers, including you, can pay for anything.\nBut what if the till had access to a record, or ledger, of the balance on your credit and debit cards that was updated anytime you bought something? \nEven with the bank's systems down your card would still work at the supermarket, because the till itself would know your balance.\nThat is just one possibility offered by a distributed ledger, also referred to as a blockchain. The technology has been around for more than a decade and has been heavily hyped.\nIt sounds pretty handy, but in practice, it is hardly used. So what happened?\nBlockchain has struggled to find a purpose, beyond powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\nIn that scenario, the blockchain acts as a universal record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made. The blockchain is a ledger, or log, of those transactions and users on the network collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur. They're rewarded financially for this effort - an enterprise known as \"Bitcoin mining\". \nBut the basic idea, of a ledger of information distributed around lots of different users instead of held centrally, has provoked a lot of interest.\nProponents have long argued it could be a better alternative to traditional databases.\nBut how transformative would blockchain-style alternatives really be? The shop tills example was suggested by Dave Birch, an author and advisor on digital financial services, who has been critical of some proposed blockchain schemes in the past.\n\"I'm prepared to buy that,\" he says, of the tills idea. \"I think there's some value to it.\"\nThere are other ideas out there. Prof Gilbert Fridgen, a financial services expert at Luxembourg University suggests a distributed ledger system that keeps track of certificates and degrees issued by universities.\nNo one organisation would be responsible for it. Rather, copies of the ledger would be held by multiple parties and individuals would be able to check that records of their own qualifications were accurate.\nIt would certainly by useful. In 2018, a BBC investigation showed that there were thousands of fake degrees in circulation, so a decentralised system that tracks qualifications might appeal to employers.\nThat said, Prof Fridgen notes that nothing about a blockchain itself can stop some corrupt individuals trying to add fraudulent information to it. Additional checks are needed.\nIf those trust issues can be solved, then blockchains could have real benefits.\nNews surfaced recently of More Technology of Business of migrants from the Commonwealth who have had their legal status questioned because records were not kept of their being granted leave to remain in the 1970s. In the future, such errors might be avoided by keeping information like this on a distributed ledger instead of relying on the government to look after it.\nSome big businesses have been incorporating the technology into their operations.\nTake shipping giant Maersk. It uses blockchain technology in TradeLens, a new system for tracking customs documentation on goods that are shipped internationally. The idea is that any stakeholder in the process, from a port to a customs authority, can quickly look up details pertaining to a shipment. \nMaersk says that 10 million shipping events are now registered in the system every week. \nUnlike Bitcoin, TradeLens uses a permissioned blockchain, this is a non-public ledger to which access is controlled.\nBut a similar system could be achieved with other technologies such as cloud-based ledger databases that encrypt data and control who can access what information.\nAnother project of interest is the real estate system trialled by the Swedish land registry, Lantm\u00e4teriet. A blockchain was designed to track documents during the sale of a property. The buyer and seller, brokers and banks involved could all take part in and keep track of the sale digitally.\nWhile the trial proved such a scheme was possible, a change in legislation would be needed before the system could be scaled up in the future, explains Mats Sn\u00e4ll, chief innovation officer at the Swedish land registry.\n\"It was never integrated into the production system of the land registry,\" he tells the BBC.\nIn Thailand, cryptocurrency firm Zcoin developed a blockchain-based system so that members of the Thai Democrat Party could cast digital votes for their new leader in late 2018. Instead of having to trust a central authority to count the votes, they were instead collected on the Zcoin blockchain.\nVotes were made at polling stations or via a mobile app, where voters needed to submit a photo of themselves when casting their ballot. \nThese digital votes were also audited by the election committee, a Zcoin spokesman tells the BBC. Zcoin says it is planning to announce a bigger scheme, involving \"millions\" of voters, in the near future.\nThese are thought-provoking ventures, though a debate remains as to whether blockchain is absolutely necessary for any of them.\nSome say that eventually blockchain-style systems will prove to be the most efficient option for organising data at scale. Entrepreneur Helen Disney is one of them.\n\"In many cases there is a cost saving to be made once you've got past the initial hurdle - obviously bringing in any new system is expensive,\" she says.\nWhile blockchain bluster will surely continue, even sceptics like Mr Birch think there are some focused applications that could prove worthwhile. So far, blockchain might not have changed the world - but it has got a lot of people thinking.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-51391981": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-51391981", "title": "\u2018I was raped at 14, and the video ended up on a porn site\u2019", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:01:41 GMT", "summary": "When Rose Kalemba was raped, it took her months to persuade a porn website to remove the video.", "story": "Last year Rose Kalemba wrote a blog post explaining how hard it had been - when she was raped as a 14-year-old girl - to get a video of the attack removed from a popular porn website. Dozens of people then contacted her to say that they were facing the same problem today.\nThe nurse stopped at the doorway leading out of Rose's hospital room and turned to face her.\n\"I'm sorry this happened to you,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"My daughter was raped too.\" \nRose looked at the nurse. She couldn't be older than 40, Rose thought, her daughter must be young, like me.\nShe thought back to the morning after the assault, to the conversations with the emotionless policeman and the clinical doctor. Everyone had used the phrase \"alleged\" when referring to the violent, hours-long overnight attack that Rose had described to them. With the exception of her father and grandmother, most of her relatives hadn't believed her either.\nWith the nurse it was different. \n\"She believed me,\" Rose says.\nIt was a small crack of hope - someone recognising and acknowledging what had happened to her. A wave of relief washed over her, which felt like it could be the start of her recovery.\nBut soon hundreds of thousands of people would see the rape for themselves and from those viewers she received no sympathy.\nA decade later, Rose Kalemba brushes her thick thigh-length black hair at the bathroom mirror, twirling the ends with her fingers to form natural ringlets. This wouldn't have been the case in the months after her attack - all the mirrors in her home had to be covered with blankets, as she couldn't bear to catch her reflection. \nShe is now 25 and she has organised routines of self-care into her daily life. \nTaking care of her hair is one. Combing it takes time and effort, it's almost an act of meditation. She knows she has beautiful hair, people comment on it all the time. Every morning she also makes herself a cup of cacao, a pure, raw form of chocolate that she believes has healing qualities, and writes down her goals in a diary.\nShe deliberately puts them in the present tense. \n\"I'm an excellent driver,\" is one goal. \"I'm happily married to Robert,\" is another. \"I'm a great mother.\"\nSitting down to talk, Rose pulls her hair over her shoulders - it covers most of her body, her own armour. \nGrowing up in a small town in Ohio, it wasn't unusual for Rose to go for a walk alone before bedtime. It cleared her head, she enjoyed the fresh air and peace. So that evening in summer 2009 started like most for 14-year-old Rose.\nBut then a man appeared from the shadows. At knifepoint he forced her into a car. Sitting in the passenger seat was a second man, aged about 19 - she'd seen him around town. They drove her to a house on the other side of town and raped her over a period of 12 hours, while a third man filmed parts of the assault.\nRose was in shock - she could hardly breathe. She was badly beaten and stabbed on her left leg, her clothes bloody. She fell in and out of consciousness.\nAt some point, one of the men got out a laptop and showed Rose videos of attacks on other women. \"I am of first nations ethnicity,\" she says. \"The attackers were white and the power structure was clear. Some of the victims were white but many were women of colour.\"\nLater, the men threatened to kill her. Forcing herself to collect her senses, Rose began to talk to them. If they released her, she wouldn't reveal their identities, she said. Nothing would ever happen to them, no-one would know.\nTaking her back in the car, men dumped her in a street about half an hour's walk from her home. \nWalking through the door, she caught sight of her reflection in the hall mirror. A gash in her head was oozing blood. \nHer father, Ron, and some extended family were in the living room about to have lunch. Still bleeding from her stab wound, she explained what had happened to her.\n\"My dad called the police, he immediately comforted me, but the others said I had asked for it by walking out late at night,\" Rose says. \nAt the hospital, Rose was greeted by a male doctor and male police officer.\n\"They both dealt with me in an extremely matter-of-fact manner,\" she adds, \"There was no kindness, no warmth.\"\nThe male police officer asked her if this had started as consensual. Was it a night gone wild, he wondered.\nRose was stunned. \n\"Here I was beaten beyond recognition. Stabbed and bleeding...\"\nRose told them no, it had not been consensual. And still reeling from what she had been through, she said she didn't know who had attacked her. The police had no leads to go on.\nWhen Rose was released the next day, she attempted suicide, unable to imagine how she could possibly live a normal life now. Her brother found her in time.\nA few months later, Rose was browsing MySpace when she found several people from her school sharing a link. She was tagged. Clicking on it, Rose was directed to the pornography-sharing site, Pornhub. She felt a wave of nausea as she saw several videos of the attack on her. \n\"The titles of the videos were 'teen crying and getting slapped around', 'teen getting destroyed', 'passed out teen'. One had over 400,000 views,\" Rose recounts. \n\"The worst videos were the ones where I was passed out. Seeing myself being attacked where I wasn't even conscious was the worst.\"\nShe made an instant decision to not tell her family about the videos - most of them had not been supportive anyway. Telling them would achieve nothing.\nWithin days it was evident that most of her peers at school had seen the videos. \n\"I was bullied,\" she says, \"People would say that I asked for it. That I led men on. That I was a slut.\"\nSome boys said their parents had told them to stay away from her, in case she seduced them and then accused them of rape.\n\"People have an easier time blaming the victim,\" she says.\nRose says she emailed Pornhub several times over a period of six months in 2009 to ask for the videos to be taken down. \n\"I sent Pornhub begging emails. I pleaded with them. I wrote, 'Please, I'm a minor, this was assault, please take it down.'\"\nShe received no reply and the videos remained live. \n\"The year that followed I withdrew into myself. I disassociated,\" she recalls, \"I felt nothing. Numb. I kept to myself.\"\nShe would wonder, with every stranger who made eye contact with her, if they had seen the videos. \n\"Had they got off to it? Had they gratified themselves to my rape?\"\nShe couldn't bear to look at herself. That's why she covered the mirrors with blankets. She would brush her teeth and wash in the dark, thinking all the time about who could be watching the videos.\nThen she had an idea. \nShe set up a new email address posing as a lawyer, and sent Pornhub an email threatening legal action. \n\"Within 48 hours the videos disappeared.\"\nMonths later Rose began to receive counselling, finally revealing the identity of her attackers to the psychologist, who was duty bound to report them to the police. But she didn't tell her family or the police about the videos. \nThe police collected victim impact statements from Rose and her family. The attackers' lawyers argued that Rose had consented to sex, and the men were charged not with rape but \"contributions towards the delinquency of a minor\" - a misdemeanour - and received a suspended sentence.\nRose and her family did not have the energy, or the resources, to fight for a tougher sentence.\nIt's clear that Ron Kalemba thinks a lot about what happened to his daughter all those years ago. What could he have done differently, if he'd known more, he wonders. His daughter changed after the assault. She went from being a straight-A student to missing classes, rarely handing in her homework.\nWe're sitting in a park near his home that Ron visits often. He and Rose sometimes read from passages of the Bible from a picnic bench together. They don't talk much about the past.\n\"It feels like the whole world let her down,\" he says. \"Her abuse, it was like it was a big joke to everyone. It changed her life completely, and people let her down every step of the way.\" \nRon only heard about the Pornhub videos in 2019, when a blog that Rose shared about her abuse went viral on social media. He had no idea that his daughter's rape had been seen by so many people, nor that people in her school had mocked her for it.\n\"I knew a girl in eighth grade when I was in school,\" Ron recalls. \"People would pick on her, and she would get beaten up. And none of us would say anything, we just watched it happen.\"\n\"I ran into her years later and she thought that I was a bully too, because I had just stood by and watched it happen. In reality it had only been a couple of people who actually hurt her but she thought we were all against her because we watched it and said nothing. That's what the silence felt like to her.\"\nIs this what he thinks happened to Rose?\n\"Yes but it was worse for her. She had a digital crowd of bullies too. Some silent and some abusive. Hers is a different world.\"\nOver the next few years Rose would often disappear into the digital world.\nShe threw herself into writing, expressing herself on blogs and social media, sometimes using aliases, sometimes her real name.\nOne day in 2019, as she was scrolling through her social media feed she saw a number of posts about Pornhub. People were praising it for donating to bee conservation charities, adding caption facilities for deaf viewers, donating to aid domestic violence charities and providing $25,000 scholarships for women who want to enter the tech industry.\nAccording to Pornhub, there were 42 billion visits to its website in 2019 - an increase of 8.5 billion from the year before, with a daily average of around 115 million. And 1,200 searches per second.\n\"It's impossible to miss Pornhub if you use social media,\" says Rose. \"They've done a great job at positioning themselves as a 'woke' mission, almost transcending porn, but videos titled like mine are still on the site. There's no way of knowing if there are rapes on there and the victims don't know it.\"\nIn the viral blog post, Rose shared a detailed account of her rape, and called out Pornhub for turning a blind eye until she pretended to be a lawyer. Dozens of women and some men responded to her post, saying that videos showing them being sexually abused had also appeared on the site.\nIn a statement to the BBC, Pornhub said: \"These horrific allegations date back to 2009, several years prior to Pornhub being acquired by its current owners, so we do not have information on how it was handled at that time. Since the change in ownership, Pornhub has continuously put in place the industry's most stringent safeguards and policies when it comes to combating unauthorised and illegal content, as part of our commitment to combating child sex abuse material. The company employs Vobile, a state-of-the-art third party fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform.\"\nWhen asked why videos with titles similar to those uploaded featuring Rose's rape, such as \"teen abused while sleeping\", \"drunk teen abuse sleeping\" and \"extreme teen abuse\" are still active on Pornhub, the company said: \"We allow all forms of sexual expression that follow our Terms of Use, and while some people may find these fantasies inappropriate, they do appeal to many people around the world and are protected by various freedom of speech laws.\"\nPornhub introduced a \"non-consensual content removal system\" in 2015, but stories about videos of abuse on the website continue to surface.\nIn October last year a 30-year-old Florida man, Christopher Johnson, faced charges for sexually abusing a 15-year-old. Videos of the attack had been posted on Pornhub. \nIn a statement to the BBC regarding this case, Pornhub said its policy is to \"remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case\".\nIn 2019 Pornhub also removed a channel called Girls Do Porn, when 22 women sued it for forcing them to take part in videos, and the channel's owners were charged with sex trafficking. \n\"People may say that what happened to me a decade ago isn't a reality of today, but that is simply not the case,\" says Rose.\n\"Women have told me that it is still happening, after they saw my blog. And these are Western women with access to social media.\n\"I don't doubt that videos in other parts of the world, in places we know porn is consumed in large bulks like the Middle East and Asia are places where the victim might not even be aware that their abuse is being shared.\"\nThe BBC also spoke to one woman who emailed Rose. A video showing her being abused remained for years on a smaller site, even though she sent several emails to the company, and left a post in the comments section under the video. The woman, from California, says that the video has also been downloaded and shared on other porn sites. Lawyers for the website told the BBC that their clients had \"no knowledge of any such situation\". The BBC then provided a link to the video, as well as screenshots of comments by the woman requesting for it to be removed. It was finally removed in the following days.\n\"What happened to Rose in 2009 is still happening today on several free streaming porn sites - and not just Pornhub,\" says Kate Isaacs from Not Your Porn, a group that investigates porn sites.\n\"There's nothing we can do about rogue, smaller porn sites set up by individuals but large commercial sites like Pornhub need to be held accountable and they are not right now. No laws apply to them.\"\nSo-called revenge pornography, which is a type of image-based sexual abuse, has been a criminal offence in England and Wales since 2015. The law defines it as \"the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person, without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress\". It is punishable by up to two years' imprisonment. However platforms that share this content have not been held accountable so far.\n\"Porn sites are aware that there is disturbing and non-consensual content on their platforms,\" says Isaacs. \"They know that there is no way we can differentiate fantasy role-play acting, or faked production scenarios, or real abuse.\"\nShe set up Not Your Porn when a sex video featuring a friend of hers (who was under 16 at the time) was uploaded on to Pornhub. Kate says more than 50 women in the UK have come to her in the past six months to say that sexual videos have been posted without their consent on pornography sites. Thirty of them were uploaded to Pornhub.\nShe also points out that Pornhub and other websites enable viewers to download videos on to their own computer - so even if the video is taken down from one website it's easy for any of these users to share it or upload it again to another.\nNot Your Porn are campaigning for laws in that UK that would make the sharing of non-consensual pornographic videos a criminal offence.\nRose has hope for the future. In her early 20s she met her boyfriend, Robert, who she says has helped her discuss and come to terms with her abuse. She hopes they'll get married and have a daughter. And her dog Bella, a pitbull is a source of strength.\n\"I've grown up around pitbulls. They may have a reputation of being aggressive but they're so sweet,\" she says. \"They're aggressive only if abused by humans,\" she adds pointedly.\n\"In many ways, I have a life sentence,\" Rose say. \"Even now I could be at the grocery store and I wonder if a stranger has seen my video.\"\nBut she no longer wants to be silent, she says. \n\"The most powerful weapon of a rapist is our silence.\" \nPurnima Shil was gang-raped in northern Bangladesh at the age of 13 and she has not been allowed to forget it. Twelve years later, because of the stigma that attaches to rape victims in some parts of the country, someone shamed her by creating a pornographic Facebook page in her name - with her photograph and telephone number.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376973": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51376973", "title": "'I remember the roaches walking across the floor'", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:01:47 GMT", "summary": "When Rob Bernshteyn and his family escaped the Soviet Union, they initially found the US was worse.", "story": "The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive of US software company Coupa.\nWhen Rob Bernshteyn and his family finally managed to escape the Soviet Union, they initially found that the US was worse.\n\"We settled in a pretty tough neighbourhood of Brooklyn [New York, in 1980],\" says Rob looking back. \"You didn't want to be walking round at night unless you were carrying. I mean, this was a rough neighbourhood, very rough. New York was a different place back then.\n\"The apartment we were in, I remember the size of the roaches, an inch and a half, walking across the floor. There was graffiti everywhere when you walked down the street, and you constantly heard the sirens of ambulances and police. All of it was really scary for us.\"\nNow 44, and a successful US business leader, Rob was just six when he and his parents were able to swap Leningrad (today's St Petersburg) for New York. A Jewish family, his parents wished to get away from the anti-Semitism they were facing in the Soviet Union, and also gain the economic opportunity on offer in the US.\nSo risking the wrath of Soviet authorities, his father and mother - both engineers - applied to emigrate. \"It took four years for them to get approval,\" says Rob.\n\"There was a real risk in applying, because if you got rejected you were called a \"refusenik\" and often those folks lost their jobs. Many wound up on the street, and some got shipped to Siberia.\n\"But luckily we were on the list that was allowed to leave, and there was a [Jewish] agency in the US at the time that helped.\"\nHis family arrived in the US with just $1,000 (\u00a3765) and two suitcases, and Rob says he can remember his dad taking him \"dumpster diving\" to try to find discarded furniture that he could patch up and put in their small flat.\nThankfully his parents were both soon able to find work; his father with engineering giant Honeywell, and his mother with the New York Department of Environmental Protection. But Rob initially had a much harder time at school.\n\"It was a really tough school in Brooklyn, and I got beat up pretty badly for being seen as a, you know, communist, and all that,\" he says.\nRob says that things improved as he started to lean English, and he found that he was academically gifted, especially at maths. Home life also got a lot better when his parents had saved up enough money to move out of Brooklyn to suburban Long Island.\nAfter secondary school Rob did a degree in information systems at the State University of New York at Albany. He then began his working life as a management consultant, first with Accenture and then McKinsey.\nIn 2000, aged 24, he took time out to do the celebrated master of business administration course at Harvard University, before going into the software industry. Moving to Silicon Valley he spent a number of years with first Oracle, and then SAP.\nBut ultimately keen to be his own boss, in 2009, aged just 32 he took up the top job at a small software business called Coupa. Set up three years earlier, Coupa makes cloud-based procurement systems to enable companies to more easily buy all the supplies they need, such as laptops and office chairs - or the cleaning firms they employ.\nRob had ambitious plans to expand the firm, but with the global financial crisis still in full swing at the time it was a struggle to secure financial backing.\n\"I pitched to investors three or four times a day, for weeks on end, and no-one was believing me that Coupa could become a multi-billion dollar company,\" he says. \"Some three dozen people rejected me.\n\"Then right before we were going to run out of cash I found a venture capitalist who decided to get behind me more than the company. We got $7m, which valued the business at $15m.\"\nFrom that point on, sales at Coupa have continued to rise steadily, thanks in the main to positive word of mouth. Today, its thousands of clients include sportswear brand Adidas, bank BNP Paribas, drinks firm Britvic, retailer Office Depot and aerospace business Rolls-Royce.\nWith quarterly revenues of more than $100m, and 2,000 employees, Coupa - which floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2016 - now has a market capitalisation or value of \u00a310bn.\nStuart Lauchlan, co-founder of technology news website Diginomica, says Coupa meets \"a genuine business need\".\n\"Great tech matters of course, but it's how that tech is used for bottom line benefit that really matters,\" he adds. \"Bernshteyn last year commented that Coupa had earned legitimacy among enterprise buyers at some of the world's largest companies. There was a lot of hard work that went into achieving that.\"\nLooking ahead, Rob says he has no plans to slow down or learn how to relax more. \"This isn't really work for me, it's a way of life...

singer Matty Healy has pledged.\nThe musician made the promise after this year's Reading and Leeds festivals were criticised for a gender imbalance.\nOnly 20 of the 91 acts on the initial line-up are women, leading a journalist to challenge Healy to insist on greater equality at festivals where he plays.  \n\"Take this as me signing this contract,\" said the singer, whose band headlined Reading and Leeds in 2019.\nThe 1975 won best British group and best British album at last year's Brit Awards.Guardian writer Laura Snapes asked the frontman to \"only play festivals that commit to X% (ideally 50%!) acts that include women and non binary performers\".\nHealy accepted the challenge, saying \"people need to act, not chat\".\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"I have agreed to some festivals already that may not adhere to this [condition] and I would never let fans down who already have tickets. \n\"But from now I will and believe this is how male artist can be true allies.\"\nTake this

I can feel the change!\"\nThe 1975 are holding their own one-day festival in London's Finsbury Park this summer, where six of the seven support acts are female. \nThe https://t.co/1eaZG2hEze lineup with the men removed. Where are all the women aye? @OfficialRandL #readingfestival \nEnd of Twitter post  by @lucy_mccourt\nThe issue of gender balance on festival line-ups has been a talking point since 2015, when the music blog Crack in the Road tweeted a doctored image of the Reading and Leeds poster, erasing all acts that didn't include a female performer. Only 10 groups remained.\nAnalysis by the BBC suggests only 8% of this year's major festival headliners are female, with just three acts - Taylor Swift, Little Mix and Haim - topping the bill at the UK's 16 biggest festivals.\nSome progress has been made in the past five years - with more than 300 festivals and music organisations signing up to the Keychange initiative, which aims to achieve a 50/50 gender balance by 2022.\nMaxie Gedge, who runs Keychange at the PRS Foundation, welcomed Healy's statement, calling him \"an ally that we appreciate\".\n\"Working together and doing everything we can to ensure equality in the music industry is crucial if we're to make change happen. \n\"Since 2017 over 300 festivals and music organisations have signed up to our Keychange pledge for gender equality and we'd be more than happy to put Matt in touch with all of the festivals that pledged - including those that have already reached a gender parity with their line-ups ahead of their 2022 target date.\"\nGeoff Ellis, who organises Scotland's TRNSMT festival, caused outrage earlier this year when he suggested it would take \"several years\" for equality to be achieved.\n\"There's far, far less female artists,\" #leedsfestival. \"We need to get more females picking up guitars, forming bands, playing in bands.\"\nWhile there is some truth to his comments - only 20% of artists signed to a UK record label are female - other festivals have shown that gender balance is possible.\nIn 2019, Spain's Primavera festival had a 50/50 line-up, while Latitude managed a 40/60 split between women and men. Meanwhile, 59% of the acts who played at Liverpool Sound City last summer were female or female-fronted.\nHealy said he wanted to see other male musicians taking a pledge to ensure equal representation, pic.twitter.com/B70Y97IAWZ: \"It's something that, if everyone gets on board, we can fix.\"\nHe said he was \"sceptical\" that festivals would jeopardise their \"short-term or long-term personal profit\" to make a change, but added: \"We should accept that some people are willing to learn.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51459553": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51459553", "title": "Does drill music cause crime, or offer an escape from it?", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:48:43 GMT", "summary": "A new film gives a voice to drill rappers, while exposing hard truths about links to knife crime.", "story": "\"These days if someone gets stabbed no-one really cares, unless it's the family. It's just another young person getting stabbed.\"\nThose chilling words come from a young boy in north London, no older than 14, in a new documentary about the links between knife crime and drill music.\nHe's not alone. His classmates describe intimidating encounters with gangs in balaclavas, and the fear that \"saying the wrong thing\" will lead to violence.\nWhat they're less clear about is whether music, specifically the dark and gritty beats of drill, encourages criminal behaviour.\n\"In the songs, they talk about how they killed so much people and all that,\" observes one pupil.\n\"Violence is a choice,\" responds another. \"Everything is a choice. You don't have to do it.\"\n\"If you think about it,\" adds a third classmate, \"drill has caused more success for people than deaths.\" \nLike the students, the documentary, titled Terms and Conditions, is divided on the question of whether drill's violent lyrics are a symptom or a cause of the rise in knife-related crime.\n\"In this time of fake news, I wanted to show both sides,\" explains Andre Montgomery-Johnson, who authored the feature-length investigation. \n\"Some people see drill music as bad, and some people see drill music as a way out - but we want to see why people have these opinions.\n\"In a way, we ask the question, 'Does drill cause knife crime?' and the viewer makes the decision. That's the most powerful thing about it.\"\nMontgomery-Johnson is uniquely placed to explore the issue. Under the name Mr Montgomery, he's one of the few journalists to cover drill closely from a grassroots level. \nHe grew up on the same streets as some of the genre's biggest names, and has lost friends of his own, including the rapper Incognito, to knife crime. \nCrucially, he files his reports on YouTube - drill's natural home - giving him authenticity within the scene.\nAs a result, he has access to some of drill's biggest stars, going behind the scenes as they record music and shoot videos. In turn, the documentary shows \"another side of these drill rappers\", who have often been painted as aggressive thugs in the media.\n\"They have pride in what they're doing. They can articulate themselves,\" says Montgomery-Johnson. \"We're giving them a voice to be understood.\"\nThe journalist recognises that drill, like grime before it, offers some of London's poorest residents an escape route.\n\"You can record a song on your phone and within 24 hours, that could potentially have a million views, which would change your whole destiny,\" he says.\nThe lyrics are often about obtaining money and status and power \"because these are the things people on the streets don't have\", explains rapper Drillminister (who recently launched a bid to become London's mayor) in the film.\nBut Montgomery-Johnson is equally aware the music can lead to problems. \n\"Some drill songs do make it seem like it's cool to carry a knife, so of course there's going to be consequences to that.\"\nThere were 90 fatal stabbings in London in 2019, according to the Met Police. Across the UK, there were 44,771 offences involving knives or sharp instruments between September 2018 and September 2019, a rise of 7%, figures from the Office of National Statistics show.\nPolice have targeted drill music in an attempt to crack down on the violence, asking YouTube to remove videos that they say incite real-world crimes.\nTo examine the links, Montgomery-Johnson spoke to knife crime activists, youth mentors, community leaders, police officers and, in his documentary's most moving scenes, the mothers of several victims.\nAmong them was Sharon Kendall, whose 18-year-old son Jason Isaacs died after being ambushed by four assailants on mopeds as he walked to a friend's house in November 2017.\n\"The boy that killed Jason, he's in numerous YouTube videos and all they speak about is stabbing people in the back,\" she says. \n\"It's a massive thing, this drill music. I don't think it's the only cause, but it's one of the causes.\"\nSeveral interviewees blame YouTube for disseminating violent videos without checks in place (a segment that's all the more striking when you learn that Terms and Conditions is being released under the YouTube Originals banner).\n\"They're not being mindful of the things they're allowing to be put onto their platforms,\" says campaigner Lucy Martindale, who developed PTSD after witnessing her cousin's murder at the age of nine.\n\"It's just a way of these gangs communicating with each other really violently and making threats. They need to take them [the videos] down very quickly.\"\n\"I think YouTube has a massive responsibility because, ultimately, it's a platform which they profit from,\" agrees Sayce Holmes-Lewis, director of youth work charity Mentivity.\n\"If young people are losing their lives because of content that's being put up, it needs to be screened at the earliest opportunity.\"\nRappers Skengdo and AM strenuously disagree. The duo, who've been handed suspended sentences for performing lyrics which police said incited violence against rival gang members, argue that their freedom of speech is being curtailed.\n\"They didn't link any crimes to our music,\" says AM. \"It was a very weak case\".\nMontgomery-Johnson offers a solution to the stand-off between rappers and law enforcement - put pre-roll disclaimers on videos to discourage copycat behaviour.\n\"They need to have little warnings that say, 'This is not real life, this is not true, this is just entertainment - like in a film'. These are people playing a role and you shouldn't take them too serious,\" he says.\nThe idea that some drill lyrics are artfully exaggerated is reinforced by 21-year-old rapper Lavida Loca, who admits in the documentary that her \"songs about violence and drugs caught everyone's attention\", encouraging her to pursue that direction.\nBut Montgomery-Johnson points out that the genre is about more than gang culture and nihilistic violence, with an artist like Drillminister tackling climate change and economic austerity in his songs.\n\"Drill is only drill because of the beats. So you can create political drill, you can create property drill, there's even gay drill. The beats is the genre, but the topic can be anything.\" \nAnd while the documentary deliberately avoids making a judgement on the link between drill and knife crime, you're left with the impression that it's only one pixel in a bigger picture.\n\"There's so many things that you can look at,\" says Montgomery-Johnson.  \"The lack of father figures, the lack of economic structure, the lack of activities, the lack of opportunities. \n\"So I think, yeah man, there's more than just drill to knife crime. There's other structures that are failing our young people. That's what I learnt.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51473761": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51473761", "title": "'A real delight' - Artist Sonia Boyce to make history at Venice Biennale", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:05:13 GMT", "summary": "Sonia Boyce will be the first black woman to represent Great Britain at the prestigious art festival.", "story": "Artist Sonia Boyce is to become the first black woman to represent Great Britain at the prestigious Venice Biennale next year.\nBoyce will fly the flag with a major new exhibition at the world's most important contemporary art festival.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the offer came as \"a real shock, but a real delight as well\".\nThe London-based artist rose to prominence in the 1980s as one of the leading lights in black British art.\nHer art has often dealt with themes of race and gender, initially working with pastels and then moving into photography, video, sound and installations. \n\"That early work in the 1980s was very much about me being the centre of a lot of those images that I was making, and I would often talk about growing up in the UK, being black and being female, and what it was like at that particular time,\" she told Today.\n\"And the work has since shifted, which I suppose is what we're going to be seeing when the show goes to Venice.\"\nBoyce was made an MBE in 2007 and was elected to the Royal Academy in 2016.

It had been estimated to sell for \u00a320m-\u00a330m - and ended up going for \u00a323,117,000.\nThe painting, in Hockney's minimalist style, depicts the moment after a diver hits the water in an LA swimming pool.\nIt is considered one of the stand-out pop art images of the 20th Century and is one of a trio of works alongside A Little Splash and A Bigger Splash.\nA Bigger Splash is housed in London's Tate Britain while A Little Splash remains in a private collection and has never appeared on the public market.\n\"Not only is this a landmark work within David Hockney's oeuvre, it's an icon of Pop that defined an era and also gave a visual identity to LA,\" Emma Baker, head of Sotheby's contemporary art evening sale, said in a statement.\nWhen it was previously sold to a private owner in 2006 it went for \u00a32.9m - a then record price for a Hockney work - and it has remained with that buyer until now. \nPrior to that, the \u00a31.9m sale of A Neat Lawn, also in 2006, had set a precedent for a Hockney. \nSince then, the growing interest among the most wealthy in the value-holding investment benefits of high-end contemporary art have seen auction prices climb. \nThis was illustrated at a 2018 auction at Christie's in New York where Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for just over $90m (\u00a370m) - an auction record at the time for a work by a living artist. \nIt's since been beaten by the $91.1m (\u00a370.3m) sale in 2019 of a sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons.\nIn May 2018, Hockney's Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica sold for $28.5m (\u00a322m) - which was more than double the previous auction record for the artist.\nThe Splash captures the brief moment just seconds after a swimmer has broken the calm surface of a pool. \nThe painting's protagonist is present, yet absent, hidden by the displaced water. The work is a classic example of Hockney's lifelong fascination with the texture, appearance and depth of water.\nThe Splash series was inspired by the time Hockney spent in Los Angeles following his graduation from art school. \nHe first visited the Californian city in 1964. On returning to London later that year, he began to work on his first pool painting, Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool, which fetched $7.2m (\u00a35.6m) at an auction at Sotheby's New York in November 2019.\nIn 1966, he went back to Los Angeles and moved into an apartment in the city. It was there that Hockney, in his new sun-soaked environment, created the Splash paintings between 1966 and 1967.  \n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51471305": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51471305", "title": "WWE: The Rock's daughter, Simone Johnson, will step into the ring", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:04:14 GMT", "summary": "The 18-year-old will be the fourth-generation wrestler in the family", "story": "The daughter of wrestling legend, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, is set to continue her family's legacy. \nSimone Johnson, 18, has started training with WWE - following in the footsteps not just of her dad but her grandad, and her great-grandad too.\nShe will be the first fourth-generation superstar in WWE history.\n\"It means the world to me,\" Simone said in a statement. \"To know that my family has such a personal connection to wrestling is really special to me and I feel grateful to have the opportunity, not only to wrestle, but to carry on that legacy.\" \nHer training has already started alongside other future wrestling stars at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. \n\"Simone Johnson's unbridled passion and incredible drive has earned her a coveted spot training with the elite athletes from around the world at the WWE Performance Centre,\" said Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, executive vice president.  \nFollowing the announcement, The Rock posted on his Instagram: \"Dreams ain't just for dreamers...

They were calling, 'Do it again, do it again'.\"\nHe eventually became the leader and main composer for the choir, fusing indigenous Zulu songs and dances with South African isicathamiya, an a capella tradition that was frequently accompanied by a soft, shuffling style of dance.\nThey were re-christened Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a name that was significant on several levels: Ladysmith represented their hometown, Black referenced the black oxen that were the strongest on the farm, and Mambazo, from the Zulu word for axe, symbolized the group's ability to cut down the competition. \nA radio performance in 1970 led to a recording contract, and in 1973 they released Africa's first gold-selling album, Amabutho.\nThey achieved global recognition after being recruited to sing on Paul Simon's multi-million-selling Graceland album, most notably on Homeless, a song Shabalala co-wrote with Simon, based on the melody for a traditional Zulu wedding song.\nEnd of Youtube post  by PaulSimonVEVO\nThe band joined Simon on his subsequent world tour.

Even though he was looking frail, he was teaching traditional choral music to a group of young people who were clearly eager to learn from him. \nHe was singing Homeless, a song he co-wrote with Paul Simon. He was wearing a red t-shirt and stood in front of a microphone and pulled his famous isicathamiya dance moves.

the first time a non-English language film has done so.\nTwo, for best director and best original screenplay, although with Parasite winning in two other categories (best picture and best international film), you could argue that Bong won four golden statuettes in a single night - a feat only previously achieved by Walt Disney in 1953.\nBong says he has two projects up his sleeve: One is a Korean feature he's been honing for the last decade, the other is an English project, which he is in the process of researching, \n. Speaking backstage at the Oscars, he declined to give further details, but said: \"I do have a plan. I have to work. It's my job.\"\n: Best supporting actor for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Pitt played Cliff Booth, stuntman-turned-sidekick to Leonardo DiCaprio's fading TV star Rick Dalton.\n Two. He won in 2014 for producing 12 Years A Slave but had never won an acting award before now, despite several nominations. \n  He's got a number of projects on the boil as producer, including a screen version of Mark Haddon's novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. On the acting front, he's thought to be starring alongside Emma Stone in Damien Chazelle's Babylon, another movie set in the Hollywood of a bygone era. This time the story takes place in the late 1920s, during the movie industry's transition from silent films to talkies\nVariety magazine says Babylon is \n, a prime position for awards season.\n: Best supporting actress for playing a tough-talking, hotshot divorce lawyer in Marriage Story.\n  One but she's been nominated twice before - for best supporting actress in 2014's Wild, and for best actress in 1991's Rambling Rose.\n She's set to resume her role as paleobotanist (yes, that's a real job) Dr Ellie Sattler in Jurassic World, the third instalment of the rebooted dinosaur franchise.\n Fellow Jurassic stalwarts Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, alongside Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard join Dern on-screen, while director Colin Trevorrow returns after 2015's Jurassic World.\n  It's currently scheduled for release in June 2021.\n: Best actress for recreating Judy Garland's final run of concerts in the musical biopic Judy.\n Two. After nominations for three years in a row from 2002 to 2004, she finally won the Oscar for best supporting actress for the American Civil War drama Cold Mountain.\nShe has nothing on the agenda (that's known about, at least). Helen Fielding is writing a new Bridget Jones book so maybe a return to her kooky character lies on the horizon. Let's just hope she doesn't take another six years off, as she did from 2010 - 2016.\n: Best actor for his mind-bending performance in Joker.\n One, but he's been nominated three times before. He received best actor nominations for The Master in 2013 and for playing country singer Johnny Cash in Walk the Line in 2006 and was up for best supporting actor in 2001 for Gladiator. \n  C'mon C'mon.\n It's a drama in which he plays the uncle of a gifted and sensitive boy, whose father struggles with bipolar disorder.\nCo-stars include Gaby Hoffman, known for the comedy series Girls, and dancer Kenneth Kynt Bryan. Mike Mills, known for 2010's Beginners, directs and also wrote the screenplay.\n  Later this year.\n: No official film awards, but Bong Joon-ho's trusty interpreter claims the trophy for winning hearts. She became a social media phenomenon, thanks to her poise, humour and dignified dedication to her job. \nThe 25-year-old has accompanied Bong since the Cannes film festival last year (where Parasite won the Palme d'Or) and they seem to have developed a symbiotic relationship. Choi's skill has been to communicate the emotional essence of the director's words, rather than providing a literal translation. At the Oscars, she three times conveyed the director's messages of gratitude to the whole of Hollywood, unfazed by the glitzy audience.\n Choi has plans to make her own movie... about the awards season.\n\"She's a film-maker, and she studied film at university,\" said Bong, backstage at Sunday night's ceremony. \"She's writing [a] feature-length script. I'm so curious about it.\"\n: Best adapted screenplay for the Nazi satire Jojo Rabbit - an off-the-wall drama which makes you laugh and wince simultaneously as it skates the thin line of good taste. \n:  This is his first Oscar win and, in another first for the night's proceedings, he's the first Maori to win an Academy Award. \nWaititi is currently filming an unspecified role in the sequel to 2016's The Suicide Squad alongside Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Idris Elba, which is based on the DC Comics supervillain team of the same name. \nAlso on his to-do list is directing Next Goal Wins, with Elisabeth Moss and Michael Fassbender. It's an adaptation of the 2014 British football documentary about Dutch coach Thomas Rongen who attempted to turn the American Samoa soccer team from established losers into winners.  \nHe'll then co-star in comedy Free Guy (led by Stranger Things director Shawn Levy) alongside Ryan and Jodie Comer, before returning to direct the Marvel film Thor: Love and Thunder. Waititi, who previously helmed 2017's Thor: Ragnarok, will transform Natalie Portman into a female Thor, presumably replacing Chris Hemsworth's iteration of the superhero.  \nFree Guy is due out in July, followed by The Suicide Squad in August.

Traditional TV as a whole is struggling to reach younger viewers.\n\"The hottest shows on TV networks - which command the highest ad prices - are attracting older viewers, which is a challenge for brands that want to reach millennials and teens,\" American Cinema Editors awards.\n\"As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook.\"\nSo what can be done to stem the exodus of award show viewers? \nThis year's Brit Awards are The Big Picture podcast, compared with the Oscars' 24 categories.\nThe Brits are also promising \"more music\", with artists given full creative control of their performances. \nThe Baftas already edit their film awards ceremony down to a two-hour BBC broadcast.\nEven with new host Graham Norton, this year's event attracted an average  of 3.03m viewers, down from 2019's 3.5m - which in turn was said the New York Times in 2018.\nOscar watchers may recall that organisers tried to update the ceremony last year.\nThey wanted to include a slimming down the number of winners from 12 to nine, have 500,000 fewer than 2018 and to give awards including cinematography and editing during ad breaks.\nBut after popular films category, the ad break decision fewer songs performed.\nThe overall format remained the same - minus a host, after objections from heavyweights including Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese amid controversy over old homophobic tweets.\nSo was former host Johnny Carson right was reversed \"two hours of sparkling entertainment, spread out over a four-hour show\"?\nBBC News asked a group of students from the Kevin Hart resigned what they thought.\nAs potential academy voters, and maybe even future winners, they were able to offer a youthful perspective - and their views were decidedly mixed. \nWhile most of them enjoyed the ceremony, they felt it was \"too long\", \"hasn't changed in years\" and \"doesn't captivate younger audiences\". \nNone of them said it should be hostless.\nThe ditching of the popular film category split opinion. Some said it would simply reward \"the movie that made the most money\" and was \"useless\" because \"the awards must be about quality\". \nBut others liked the idea, feeling it \"might attract the attention of younger viewers\" who are currently being courted by many parts of the media.\nCaptivating winners' speeches, such as Olivia Colman's last year, make for memorable moments, and some students love it when film-makers speak about their work or politics.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Oscars\n\"Movies are meant to move people, and the people making them have powerful voices and should speak for what they believe,\" said one.\nBut others believe \"overlong thank yous are the worst\", with one student stating: \"I don't care about Hollywood's opinion on politics.\"\nThere also was no consensus about consigning categories like editing to the ad breaks. One student argued these awards represented \"where the real skill is\", but another replied: \"It should be reported afterwards.\"\nBest song performances were a big hit with the students. After all, who could forget when he famously called the Oscars by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper?\nOne remarked they \"loved\" the songs as \"they make the show feel more modern\", while another advocated reducing them all to a \"medley\".\nBBC News has also contacted Oscars organisers to see if they have any further plans for the ceremony.\nAccording to Matt Wolf from the International New York Times, Oscars organisers will \"incur outrage almost no matter what they do with the ceremony\".\n\"Even if five new pre-conditions were met, five more would emerge,\" said Wolf, who describes himself as a \"self-confessed Oscars nerd\". \nHe also thinks the organisers should televise all the categories, but said of the technical nominees: \"Mr and Mrs Middle America have no idea what they do.\"\nHe complained that \"all four acting winners are guessable this year in advance, which takes the suspense out of it.\n\"It's not the Oscars' fault, but Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Joaquin Phoenix, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern seem dead certs so the awards seem a bore.\"\nYet Wolf is sympathetic to the ceremony's organisers.\n\"The Oscars have become a very pliable punching bag; people can use it to vent their frustrations from all quarters. If they do A people want B; if they do Q people want Z.\"\nThe Oscars, he goes on, need to reflect all aspects of the ceremony. \"You want the garish dress on the red carpet as much as you want someone stunning and stellar. We need the package, warts and all. \n\"People love to complain about the Oscars, it's sort of a cultural sport, but the imperfections are what make them so glorious.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51451904": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51451904", "title": "Oscars 2020: Number of TV viewers falls to all-time low", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 20:32:05 GMT", "summary": "The awards ceremony bucked a decline in viewers last year but ratings reached a record low on Sunday.", "story": "The US live TV audience for the Oscars fell to an all-time low on Sunday.\nRoughly 23.6 million viewers tuned into the awards ceremony, according to the US broadcaster ABC, citing Nielsen.\nThe ratings fell sharply from last year when 29.5 million people watched, amid an industry-wide decline in linear TV viewing.\nSouth Korea's Parasite made history, becoming the first non-English language film to win best picture since the awards began 92 years ago.\nRenee Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland in Judy. Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor for Joker.\nDespite the ratings slump, the Oscars, which had no host for the second year running, remains the most-watched awards show.\nIn 2019 the ceremony managed to buck a four-year trend in declining viewers and increased its audience by 11% to 26.5 million.\nMusicians Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed a much-celebrated duet, while Queen opened the show.\nIt was the first year the ceremony went without a host, which some had pointed to as a reason for its increased popularity.\nBut the new record low indicates the Oscars was not able to repeat that success in 2020.\nSinger and actress Janelle Monae opened the three-and-half hour show, followed by performances by musicians Elton John and Billie Eilish.\nThe awards were presented by celebrity duos, including Timothee Chalamet and Natalie Portman, and Steve Martin and Chris Rock.South Korean viewers celebrated when Parasite director Bong Joon-ho spoke partly in South Korean during his acceptance speech.\nOther awards ceremonies, including the Emmy Awards, Golden Globes, and Grammys, also lost viewers this year.\nThe number of people who watched the 2019 Emmy Awards live fell by 32%.\nParasite won four awards in total, while Sir Sam Mendes's 1917 took three.\nThe World War One epic had been the favourite to win best picture, but its awards all came in the technical categories.\nBrad Pitt won the first Oscar of his career for best supporting actor in his role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.\nBest actress winner Renee Zellwegger paid tribute to Judy Garland, who was nominated for two Oscars but never won.\nJoker actor Joaquin Phoenix used his acceptance speech to cover topics from animal rights, to the environment and racism.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51441309": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51441309", "title": "Oscars ceremony: A clumsy attempt to address a lack of diversity", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 10:42:48 GMT", "summary": "This year's event bent over backwards to include women and BAME performers who weren't nominated.", "story": "\"Remember when a movie was a fella in a hat running away from a fella with no hair?\"\nWhen Hank Hooper, CEO of media conglomerate Kabletown, made that observation in Tina Fey's sitcom 30 Rock, it was a parody of the outmoded opinions held by the men who run Hollywood.\nYet there was an unmistakable air of Hank Hooper-ism hanging over this year's Oscars, where a war movie (1917) and a love letter to Spaghetti westerns (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) were among the front-runners.\nNo women were nominated for best director, and only one person of colour was nominated in any of the acting categories (British star Cynthia Erivo).\nAnd as you watched this year's ceremony, there was an ever-so-slightly awkward feeling that the Academy was trying to make up for that pre-event controversy.\nTo be fair, it all began superbly. Janelle Monae started the evening with a performance of It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, from the Tom Hanks movie of the same name, which became an old-time musical special.\nAs Monae interspersed her lyrics with cries of \"be loud, be lit\", perfectly choreographed dancers spun around her dressed in costumes from Little Women, Jojo Rabbit and Joker.\nBut there were also characters from Us, Queen and Slim and Dolemite Is My Name - all movies with a strong African-American voice that missed out on nominations.\n\"Those voices long deprived,\" observed Monae, before rhyming the title of Bong Joon-ho's Parasite with \"the Oscars, it's so white\".\nLater she announced \"Tonight we celebrate the women who directed phenomenal films,\" a statement that was patently untrue.\nShe signed off by telling the audience: \"We celebrate the women. I'm so proud to stand here as a black, queer woman.\" \nMonae got a rousing standing ovation - and her performance was certainly much better than Queen opening last year's show.\nBut it was strange to see the Oscars raising the curtain with a song-and-dance number dedicated to self-flagellation.\nOn to the main ceremony... And for the second year in a row, the show went without a host.\nIn 2019, Tiny Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph handled the first presenting segment brilliantly. This year's awards were kicked off by Steve Martin and Chris Rock, who were fine but no more than that.\nRock sarcastically pointed to the Academy's progress in 91 years: \"Back in 1929 there were no black acting nominees. And now in 2020 there is one black acting nominee.\"\nThe pair also referenced the lack of women in the directing category: \"Something missing from the list here. Vaginas? Yes.\"\nBut any screenwriter will tell you that the best films show, not tell. All the scripted words and host selections could not change the stark fact that the likes of Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Lulu Wang (The Farewell) and Alma Har'el (Honey Boy) weren't in the running.\nAnd so the night continued in this slightly laboured vein. At a later point, Gal Gadot, Brie Larson and Sigourney Weaver - best known for playing Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel and Ripley in the Alien movies - co-presented the award for best original score, making the point that \"all women are superheroes\".\nIt's unlikely that the scheduling of their appearance for that award was a coincidence, given that the prize went to Hilda Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir for Joker.\nThe Icelandic composer was the first woman in history to receive this award (although two women had previously won best musical or comedy score, before that category was scrapped in 1999).\nMaya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig pretended to be auditioning for film roles when they took to the stage to present the awards for production design and costume.\n\"That was an act. We were acting. We just know that there are a lot of directors here tonight,\" they joked.\nIt was very funny and led into a massively impressive a capella mash-up that took in Vogue, The Lady in Red and Sisqo's Thong Song.\nBut if the Academy has to spend most of its scriptwriting energy winking at the audience to apologise for its own mistakes, perhaps it should stop messing up the nominations so badly?\nThen, right at the end - just when it was about to go down as one of the least interesting (and most awkward) awards of recent times -  the 2020 Oscars suddenly became historic.\nParasite's surprise success in becoming the first film not in the English language to win best picture made it the thing that the 92nd Academy Awards will be forever associated with. (\"\n\" tweeted film critic Xan Brooks.)\nBong Joon-ho's win was well-deserved and, for the producers, extremely fortunate - because until then the most memorable thing about the ceremony had been a baffling performance of Lose Yourself by Eminem. \nThe rapper had not even turned up when the song, from his semi-autobiographical movie 8 Mile, won an Oscar back in 2003. So why here? Why now?\nThe feed captured the expressions of Billie Eilish and Martin Scorsese - not knowing and not caring respectively - which will surely be new Oscar gifs.\nPerhaps it was fitting that a white rapper should appear centre stage for no good reason at all on a night when so many were asking about the absence of minority and women performers.\nBut with Kelly Marie Tran, Mahershala Ali, Anthony Ramos, Zazie Beetz, Taika Waititi and Spike Lee all given time in the broadcast, the Oscars producers had at least been able to offer a token of diversity amongst the presenters.\nIf only, they must have been thinking, it had been as easy to do the same with the nominees.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51449513": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51449513", "title": "Parasite: What the Oscar win means for Korean cinema", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:48:30 GMT", "summary": "The film, directed by Bong Joon-ho, is the first non-English language film to take the top prize.", "story": "\"A miracle has happened,\" said South Korean film critic Ha Sung-tea.\n\"I'm overwhelmed. In tears,\" tweeted Korean cinema expert Jason Bechervaise, who was watching the Oscars with his son.\nSocial media went into meltdown during the Oscars, and this was just a snippet. Korean pride in this cinematic masterpiece swept through my Twitter timeline. \nAnd by the time Parasite was named best picture - winning its fourth Oscar - the voices across the country had reached a crescendo of wild congratulatory joy. \nYes, this is historic. Bong Joon-ho's comedy-thriller is the first non-English language film to win best picture. But to South Korea, these awards mean more than that. \nIt is a cultural breakthrough. \nFor a decade this country has ploughed money into the so-called Korean wave or Hallyu - K-drama, K-pop and Korean cinema.\nThe accolades from the Academy are proof that this cultural wave has come crashing down on Hollywood.\nStill, director Bong Joon-ho believes his influence is nowhere near that of K-pop idols BTS.\n\"I think BTS has 3000 times the power and influence I have. I think Korea produces a lot of great artists because we are a very emotionally dynamic people,\" he told reporters outside the Oscars.\nKorean cinema has been a force in its own right for more than 15 years, says Mr Bechervaise, who works as a professor at the department of entertainment and arts at Korea Soongsil University.\n\"But it has taken time for it to get recognition within award bodies in the US, and even a festival like Cannes - it took a long time before they finally awarded a Korean film with the Palm d'Or. \n\"It felt like it was only a matter of time before they would take notice, with Burning coming so close last year, and The Handmaiden winning a Bafta in 2018.\"\nIn some ways the seeds of success had been sown. South Korea is a nation of movie-goers and its film industry is the fifth biggest in the world in terms of box office sales. \nDirector Bong Joon-ho's talent was also well acknowledged. Memories of Murder, The Host, the science fiction thriller Snowpiercer and Okja - about a genetically modified giant pig - all won him critical acclaim.\n\"Bong Joon Ho's use of storytelling is wildly innovative, unpredictable and extremely entertaining,\" explains Prof Bechervaise, who has studied Bong's work for 15 years. \n\"He's able to take audiences in directions few other filmmakers are able to do in a movie, let alone in a single scene: from moments of humour to horror in an instant without making it jarring.\"\nBut it is Parasite which has given Bong his big global breakthrough - and for so many reasons. \nThe film is about class warfare. It is about rich and poor - a universal theme which has made it possible for this South Korean story to resonate with audiences around the world.\nThis vision is brought to life by an all-star and experienced South Korean cast who take us through plot twists which keep us guessing right until the very end. \nThe film's distributor, Neon has also been very savvy, says Prof Bechervaise.\n\"They orchestrated a very clever and effective release strategy, releasing it on a small number of screens in October before expanding it as strong word-of-mouth pulled more people in. \n\"As it added to its accolades, its box office success grew even further.\"\nThere is another Korean figure behind Parasite's success - co-producer Miky Lee who got the last word at the Oscars (after the audience protested when the lights went down). \nShe is vice chair of the South Korean conglomerate CJ Group. Very little happens in TV or film in South Korea without her involvement. \nShe is said to be a true film fanatic and has backed several of Bong's films. Her influence will have been considerable. \nIt seems ironic that this social satire about class warfare came about with the help of one of South Korea's richest companies, but all of these factors combined appear to have created a surprise hit.\nAudiences have forgotten any fear they may have had of the \"one inch barrier of subtitles\" (as Bong himself put it at the Golden Globes).\nBut can others emulate his success? Especially if he had such powerful backers from private companies.\nPresident Moon Jae-in said his government would support Korean cinema as he started his cabinet meeting with a round of applause for Parasite.\n\"Parasite has moved the hearts of people around the world with a most uniquely Korean story,\" he said. \"It reminds us of how touching and powerful a movie can be.\"\nThis year the Korean Film Council has allocated 100 billion won (\u00a365m; $85m) for film development. That's a 32% increase on last year.\nBut building on this success won't be easy, says film critic Ha Sung-tea.\n\"To create the next Bong Joon-ho will be a long term project for the Korean film industry. Director Bong Joon-ho is unique. \n\"I think now the government, the industry, and big conglomerates need to all work together to promote diverse creators and their unique perspectives.\"\nProf Bechervaise agrees.\n\"The younger generation don't have the same kind of opportunities their predecessors had as studios grow more powerful. \n\"That being said, Korean cinema is in a very strong position going forward and the infrastructure is there to find further success.\"\nBut just as Bong Joon-ho stared disbelievingly at his first Oscar while the world watched and smiled, now is a moment to bask in South Korean cinema's current success.\nDuring his acceptance speech for Best Screenplay, Bong told the audience, \"we never write to represent our countries\".\nHowever, in the next breath, he said, \"but this is a very first Oscar to South Korea.\"\nThis feels personal for this country. My team went to the pizza shop featured in the film where an enthusiastic fan told us this was South Korea's greatest moment.\nSince the Korean peninsula was split at the end of World War Two, there has been a deep-rooted insecurity here. A feeling that perhaps people can only point to it on a map because it's next to a nuclear weapon-owning dictator in the North.\nThe Oscars is affirmation that South Korea is a cultural powerhouse - and it now has a place in the history books. \nIf audiences didn't know the considerable cultural talent within this country before, they do now.\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51432470": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51432470", "title": "Oscars 2020: 10 things we learned", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 10:53:03 GMT", "summary": "How the Oscars fared for diversity, Brad Pitt gets serious and Cats is laughed at - again.", "story": "Bong Joon-ho's surprise best film win for Parasite suddenly made the Oscars seem far less predictable, given all the main acting categories went exactly as expected.\nThis highly original South Korean film, which won four Oscars, may help focus voters' minds when it comes to ensuring greater diversity in the future. \nIt has certainly made the awards more memorable. \nHere's how the ceremony played out, both on the (very wet) red carpet and in the press room.\nThere were gasps of delight in the press room when Bong Joon-ho's Parasite won best director and then best film.  \nMany had thought Sam Mendes' 1917 was a shoo-in, but there's been a groundswell of support for Parasite, the South Korean social comedy thriller, which won last year's Palme D'Or at Cannes.\nFor an Oscars criticised for a lack of diversity, this is a positive outcome - the Academy has landed its first non-English language film taking the top prize.\nFor anyone who hasn't seen it, the dark film depicts the brutally symbiotic relationship between two families - one wealthy and the other impoverished. \nBong Joon-ho told the press room his win was \"crazy\", adding: \"For this film I just did what I've always done with great artists and all my actors - but we've had these amazing results.\"\nThe film-maker had previously described subtitles as a \"one-inch barrier\" but he revised his opinion on Sunday, saying that social media and YouTube meant, \"we're all connected [and] a foreign language film doesn't really matter\". \nThe film Hair Love winning best animated short was also significant.\nIt follows the story of an African-American father who must style his daughter's hair for the first time, focusing on their relationship.\nFilm-makers Matthew A Cherry and Karen Rupert Toliver brought DeAndre Arnold, the Texas teen suspended from school for having for dreadlocks, to the ceremony with them.\nToliver spoke to the press room about the \"policing of hair\", and said: \"Black hair is very close and personal to us, so freeing black hair is freeing ourselves. \n\"We want to be able to freely walk the streets - with our hair free. Hopefully we can make social change.\"\nJojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi is also the first person of Maori descent to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\"I dedicate this to all the Indigenous kids all over the world who want to do art and dance and write stories,\" he said.\nAfter a string of decidedly funny speeches during awards season, such as naming his Bafta \"Harry\" because he was excited to take it back to the US, Brad Pitt's Oscars acceptance was something of a gear change.\n\"They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,\" Pitt said referencing the US Senate's refusal to call witnesses at President Trump's impeachment hearings.\nSerious stuff indeed.\nPitt lightened up after that, praising his Once Upon A Time In Hollywood co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, saying \"the view's fantastic\" as he rode on the lead actor's \"coat tails\", and making heartfelt comments about his children and parents.\nBut in the press room, he said made no apology for taking a political stance, saying: \" I was really disappointed with this week,\" adding: \"It's a sad day and I don't think we should let it slide - I'm very serious about that.\"\nHe added that, despite rumours he'd used a speechwriter, \"I definitely write them. I have some friends who help with the laughs but it's got to come from the heart.\n\"Historically I've always been really tentative about speeches - they make me nervous - so this round I thought I'd put some real work into it and get comfortable, so I put some effort into that.\"\nAfter so much recent press exposure, Pitt said: \"Right now I think it's time to disappear for a while and go back to making things.\"\nNo sooner have you won an Oscar than you're wanting to give it away, at least if you're Laura Dern, Bong Joon-ho or Sir Elton John. \nDern, who won best supporting actress for Marriage Story, told the press room: \"If I could give this Oscar to [Little Women director] Greta Gerwig I would do it right now, and to [The Farewell director] Lulu Wang.\"\nBoth women failed to make the best director shortlist, with five men nominated instead.\nDern added: \"There are great films by women. We should focus less on the lack of accolades, and more on the business and people and giving money to more diverse voices.\"\nWhen Bong Joon-ho won best director, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, and said: \"If I had a Texas chainsaw and could cut this into five, I would. I would give a piece to each of you.\" \nHaving just won an Oscar for their song (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again, Sir Elton immediately dedicated his trophy to writing partner and fellow Oscar-winner Bernie Taupin in the press room.\n\"This is for him, my partner of 53 years, without him I wouldn't be here,\" he said.\n\"He starts the process. Without him I'm nobody, without him I can't start the journey. I wanted to get an Oscar for everyone involved in the film.\"\nJulia Reichert won an Oscar for the documentary American Factory while undergoing chemotherapy as she battles cancer at the age of 73. \nHer film was backed by Michelle and Barack Obama, and she said the former first couple had sent her meaningful letters during her treatment.\n\"It meant so much to me, because I admire them both so much, that they would take the time to hand write, and it wasn't just 'get well soon', it was real thoughts,\" she told BBC News.\n\"That made my whole week - makes you want to survive.\"\nClutching her Oscar, which was never really in doubt, Renee Zellweger told the press room her parents would be dancing around the room together to celebrate her win.\nShe also spoke about the process of transforming into the troubled and fragile Judy Garland, saying: \"The only thing I would do by myself for this would be to sing in the car while trying to drive down the 405 bypass here in the traffic.\n\"Anyone who knows the 405 knows that's a lot of time to practise.\"\nJoker composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir was the first woman to win for original score since Anne Dudley won for The Full Monty in 1998.\nShe said: \"To the girls, to the women, to the mothers, to the daughters who hear the music bubbling within, please speak up, we need to hear your voices.\"\nMeanwhile, Sigourney Weaver told the audience of another significant milestone: \"Tonight we want to celebrate for the first time in the Oscars' 92-year history, a female conductor, Eimear Noone, will be leading the orchestra finally.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC last week, Noone said she was relieved not to have the \"nasty job\" of playing people off-stage if their speeches over-ran.\nSo now you know.\nJames Corden and Rebel Wilson came on stage dressed as their characters from Cats.\n\"As cast members of Cats, nobody understands more than us the importance of good visual effects,\" they deadpanned.

Don't worry.\"\nLong after The Smiths had been left at the cemetery gates, Street found himself at the centre of another cultural cornerstone with Britpop and Blur. \nThe Londoner was perfectly placed to record the band's \"diverse\" and ultimately acclaimed third album, Parklife. He describes it as being \"here, there and everywhere,\" sonically-speaking, \"yet it all hangs together well as a perfect, perfect album.\"\nIt seems unthinkable now, but the title song almost didn't make it out of the studio.\n\"Parklife, the track, went through a very difficult process,\" Street explains.\n\"It was one of the very first tracks [to be recorded] and we just couldn't get it the way we wanted. At this point, Damon [Albarn] was doing the narration on the verses and it just fell flat.\n\"I think we were being too precious with it because the pressure was on us to make it a single - as it obviously had a great chorus - and we made the drums too tight. So we left it in the can for a while.\" \nEnd of Youtube post  by Blur\nIn stepped Quadrophenia actor Phil Daniels - who had initially been booked to lend his Cockney vocal stylings to another track called The Debt Collector - and he \"really kicked life back into the song\".\n\"We got Dave [Rowntree] back in to play in a much more bombastic, loose kind of fashion and it all came together,\" says Street.\n\"So it was saved, but at one point it nearly didn't make the record - which would've been strange, wouldn't it?\n\"Sometimes you can be banging your head against a brick wall and you've just got to walk away from it for a while, let it stew and then come back and look at it from a fresh angle.\"\nWhen Street first got involved with The Cranberries he thought they could become a decent little indie act, akin to the Cocteau Twins or The Sundays, but he says \"no-one could have foreseen\" the huge global success that was to follow.\nTheir debut album, 1993's Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? featured tender tracks like Dreams and Linger but was almost \"ignored forever\" in the UK, until MTV started to show them some love in the States.\n\"It was a fairy story,\" says Street.\nBy the time their second album came around, the Irish band - who were playing \"every gig under the sun\" - were ready to cut loose and Street let them to do so spectacularly on the \"bona fide classic,\" Zombie: a protest song about an IRA bomb in Warrington which killed two boys and injured many more.\n\"That was really the band just flexing their muscles on the second album because they were playing so many live dates at this point and wanted to rock out.\n\"So much of their material was relatively mellow so [Zombie] was done as a way of letting off steam. We didn't make it with any pressure really because we had no-one looking over us at that point saying 'make a classic rock record!'\n\"It turned into a huge hit for them.\"\nEnd of Youtube post  by TheCranberriesVEVO\nOver the years, Street has advised The Cranberries and others including The Kaiser Chiefs and Pete Doherty (he even ended up playing guitar with Babyshambles on tour at one point) when he thinks a song is too long, or needs of a more ear-grabbing intro. On the whole, though, he believes it's vital to remember \"it's not my record\". \n\"I'm not employing them,\" he says. \"They're employing me to do them a service and that's one thing I always try to remember\".\nThe Cranberries' fairy story ended tragically with the death of singer Dolores O'Riordan in 2018, aged 46. The band employed Street's services one final time to piece together tracks they had been working on before her death.\n\"I'm pleased that at least we managed to make one more record,\" he says, while acknowledging \"it's a dangerous thing\" for a band's remaining members to release music posthumously. \n\"You can be accused of some kind of ulterior motives but it was done with a lot of love and affection, so when we were nominated for a Grammy, I was delighted for the band.\"\n"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-51460528": {"link":

installation for Blackpool Illuminations after winning a contest.\nBlackpool's Jack Irving has been awarded \u00a3100,000 to create his design, after artists were asked to bring a \"new dimension\" to the famous show. \nThe artist, who created three pieces for the singer, will create his vision with Lancaster University scientists.\nThe 26-year-old said making a new illumination was a \"dream come

there had been some \"extraordinarily exciting entries\", but Irving's was the best.\nThe artist, who takes inspiration from his hometown's bright lights, said the as-yet-unrevealed piece was inspired

hair who later dabbled in class A drugs, and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist, would he deport that boy?\n\u201cOr is it one rule for black boys from the Caribbean and another for white boys from the United States?\u201d\nThe prime minister was born in New York and gave up his US citizenship in 2016. He \n and was recorded in 1990 on a call with his friend Darius Guppy, who was discussing how he planned on beating up a fellow journalist.\nCorbyn used Prime Minister\u2019s Questions to confront Johnson over the controversial deportation of ex-offenders to Jamaica.\nAbout 50 people were due to be flown to the country earlier this week, including those convicted of rape, manslaughter and drugs offences.\nHowever, the court of appeal \n of 25 people due on the flight over concerns they had not had adequate access to legal advice because of a temporary outage of mobile phone signal in January.\nCorbyn asked about the case of one offender who came to the UK aged five, who was recruited into a county lines drugs gang and had served time for his drugs offence.\nThe Labour leader said the man had served his time in prison and had never committed another crime.\nHe asked: \u201cDoes the prime minister think that someone who came to this country at the age of five and was the victim of county lines grooming and compelled to carry drugs, released five years ago and never reoffended, deserves to be deported?\u201d\nJohnson replied: \u201cIt is entirely right that foreign national offenders should be deported from this country in accordance with the law.\u201d\nCorbyn said: \u201cThen the government has learnt nothing from the \n.\n\u201cThis cruel and callous government is trying to mislead the British people into thinking it\u2019s solely deporting foreign nationals who are guilty of murder, rape and other very serious offences. This is clearly not the case.\u201d\nThe deportation case has ignited rows about the Windrush immigration scandal as the \n is expected to suggest that all deportation flights cease until more work can be done to ascertain people\u2019s citizenship.\nThe government has said none of the offenders are connected to Windrush and none are British nationals.\nJohnson said Corbyn had demeaned himself by the tone of his questions and \u201cbesmirches the reputation of the Windrush generation who came to this country to work in our public services, to teach our children in this country\u201d.\nHe later said the Labour leader was \u201csoft\u201d on the deportation of violent foreign offenders.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps", "title": "UK alignment on EU standards price to pay for trade deal, say MEPs", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:40:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Vote comes as bloc wields its powers to force change in UK domestic law during transition</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/12/pmqs-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-in-red-wall-seats-won-by-tories-to-lose-out-disproportionately-from-switch-to-universal-credit-report-finds-live-news\">The day\u2019s political news \u2013 live</a></li></ul><p>The European parliament has called on Michel Barnier to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU.</p><p>In a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The European parliament has called on \n to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU.\nIn a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues.\nAs MEPs gave their seal of approval for the maximalist position, the European commission for the first time wielded its powers under the withdrawal agreement to order the British government to change its domestic law, despite the country having left the EU two weeks ago.\nUnder the terms of the transition period, during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union but none of Brussels\u2019s decision-making institutions, EU law continues to be superior to UK national law.\nThe government was given two months by the commission to amend a levy on heavy trucks on which UK-registered drivers can get a discount. The EU\u2019s executive branch said the levy discriminated against those based in member states.\nIt highlights the uncomfortable position for the government for the next 11 months, during which the country will be in what Boris Johnson \n as a position of \u201cvassalage\u201d.\nThe resolution, passed by the European parliament on Wednesday, called for EU regulations to continue to set the standard for British lawmakers past 2020. MEPs said there was a need to avoid a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d as they backed dynamic alignment of UK law with the EU\u2019s.\nThe MEP Nathalie Loiseau, a former French minister for EU affairs and a member of the parliament\u2019s UK coordination group, said: \u201cThe European parliament has proposed a broad, deep and sustainable partnership that is unprecedented in scope and ambition to the UK.\n\u201cThis offer comes with balanced obligations: we will not compromise on what we stand for: high standards we have to protect consumers, workers, privacy and personal data of citizens or to protect the environment.\u201d\nThe resolution also urged Johnson to \u201cimmediately clarify\u201d his government\u2019s approach to the Irish border agreement, following his repeated \n moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nThe MEPs sought to include gender equality in trade talks, with measures to combat the pay gap, and recommended the UK should not be a net beneficiary of any EU programmes, threatening Britain\u2019s research funding.\nThe vote came as EU member states met in Brussels to further toughen up the negotiating mandate proposed by Barnier, their chief Brexit negotiator, ahead of negotiations with the UK next month.\nUnder Barnier\u2019s opening proposal the UK would need to commit to non-regression from current environmental, social and workers standards and would be tied into upgrading its legislation in the field of competition policy and state subsidies as EU positions develop in the years to come.\nFrance is among the member states which believes the EU needs a tougher negotiating stance. Its final position will be adopted by member states on 25 February.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/1bn-pledged-for-cycling-and-walking-routes-across-england-boris-johnson": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/1bn-pledged-for-cycling-and-walking-routes-across-england-boris-johnson", "title": "'\u00a31bn pledged' for cycling and walking routes across England", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:52:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>Johnson told MPs figure was \u00a3350m but sources say he made error in \u2018car crash of an announcement\u2019</p><p>The government has earmarked \u00a31bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years \u2013 not \u00a3350m, as Boris Johnson mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called \u201ca car crash of an announcement\u201d, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>But \u00a31bn is still not enough to even build Greater Manchester\u2019s 1,800-mile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/24/what-14bn-buys-1800-miles-of-cycle-lanes-or-one-big-roundabout\">Bee Network</a> of safe paths, according to its architect, Chris Boardman, a former Olympic cycling champion who is the region\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/1bn-pledged-for-cycling-and-walking-routes-across-england-boris-johnson\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The government has earmarked \u00a31bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years \u2013 not \u00a3350m, as \n mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called \u201ca car crash of an announcement\u201d, the Guardian has learned.\nBut \u00a31bn is still not enough to even build Greater Manchester\u2019s 1,800-mile \n of safe paths, according to its architect, Chris Boardman, a former Olympic cycling champion who is the region\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner.\nHe has asked Johnson for \u00a31.2bn and says he will continue to do so.\n\u201c[The announcement] doesn\u2019t change anything for me.

The Home Office had initially planned to fill the plane with dozens more people but a ruling by the court of appeal on Monday evening prevented many of the deportations.\nAccording to a response from the Home Office to an FoI request from \n, 37 people \u2013 35 men and two women \u2013 were removed on charter flights in the last three months of 2019, accompanied by 172 escorts.\nThe total cost to the Home Office of the four short-haul charter flights to Germany, France, Switzerland and Kosovo was \u00a3443,089.62. This works out at \u00a311,975 per person.\nIt is possible to buy a one-way ticket to some of these destinations on a scheduled flight for less than \u00a3100, so the cost per person on some of the charter flights was more than 100 times the going commercial rate.\nConcern has been raised about the treatment of the deportees, as well as the impact of these flights on the climate emergency. The FoI response revealed that one flight carried one deportee, another two and a third six. \nA spokesperson for the campaign group \n said: \u201cThe real issue here is the human cost of the brutal, inhumane and barely legal deportation system. From the abuses we know are suffered in detention by security guards during deportation and very often the real risk of serious harm, even death, in the countries people are sent to, the human cost of deportation charter flights is immense.\n\u201cThere is also a huge cost to the taxpayer of both detention and deportation. These costs could be completely avoided if the government let people stay at home with their families and communities.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: \u201cNot only is the government continuing the legacy of the hostile environment \u2013 fostering division in our UK society \u2013 but with the collusion with airlines on these Home Office charter flights, they are directly contributing to the climate and ecological emergency, making a hostile environment for us all.\u201d\nBella Sankey, the director of Detention Action said: \u201cAlmost half a million pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money, to deport 37 people in austerity Britain, raises serious questions about the government\u2019s approach to budgeting. But charter flights are not only bad value for money. They create perverse incentives for the authorities to bypass due process, as we\u2019ve seen with this week\u2019s controversial Jamaica deportations, requiring the court of appeal to step in.

They also rejected the charge that their group was transphobic and trans-exclusionist, saying such claims were defamatory.\nCritics of Woman\u2019s Place UK argue that the campaign seeks to limit trans people\u2019s rights and dismisses the validity of some trans people\u2019s gender identity.\nThe Labour Campaign for Trans Rights said it was \u201cheartened by the solidarity\u201d of the Labour candidates, and in relation to Woman\u2019s Place UK the \u201cevidence is clear of the discrimination trans people suffer from in our society, and organisations like theirs exist to perpetuate that discrimination. It\u2019s our view that bigotry has no place in the Labour movement, including transphobic bigotry.\u201d\nIt added: \u201cWe also want to emphasise that the response to our campaign has been overwhelmingly positive outside what is a small group of transphobes. We have now over 3,000 signatures to our pledges in just two days, representing a huge amount of support from the Labour party as a whole.\u201d\n activists have also criticised the LGB Alliance as transphobic. When the group launched in October last year, founding member Allison Bailey said \u201cgender extremism is about to meet its match\u201d. Bailey has also warned of the dangers posed by the \u201cinternational, all-powerful, wealthy & totally out of control trans lobby\u201d.\nThe group rejects claims of transphobia, insisting that \u201cpseudo-scientific\u201d approaches to gender are putting the rights of gay and bisexual people at risk.\nSerwotka, Green and Tunks all deny that their organisation is transphobic, releasing a statement on Tuesday saying their campaign was established to \u201censure that women\u2019s voices are heard and our sex-based rights upheld\u201d.\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned by the scurrilous mischaracterisation of Woman\u2019s Place UK as a \u2018transphobic organisation\u2019 and a \u2018hate group\u2019 by some individuals and groups in the Labour party, including leading figures in the current leadership election,\u201d they said. \u201cThese are accusations we absolutely refute and which we believe to be defamatory.\n\u201cWe call on those making such accusations against us to provide evidence for these claims or withdraw them.\u201d\nSam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cTrans people are targeted with violence, abuse and threats and so are women who speak out about the need to defend women-only spaces and sex-based rights. Women\u2019s fear of male violence is real and justified.\n\u201cFor reasons of women\u2019s privacy, dignity and safety the need for single-sex spaces remains. But trans people\u2019s human rights must also be recognised and their needs must also be met. The only way forward is for both sides of this issue to be heard with mutual respect. Characterising Women\u2019s Place UK in this way misrepresents them and is fundamentally unhelpful. It is time to move this agenda forward.\u201d\nThe Woman\u2019s Place UK campaign was set up in 2017 to call on the government to consult more widely about how changes to the Gender Recognition Act would affect women if ministers pressed ahead with plans to allow people to self-identify as a man or a woman. It claims that changes to self-identification are likely to threaten the rights of women. Critics view its stance on a range of issues as coming into conflict with the rights of trans people.\nThe government has delayed publication of its long-awaited decision on changes to the Gender Recognition Act, but it is expected to make a call on whether to push ahead with allowing people to legally self-identify their gender as soon as next month.

The idea of a \u201cwhite working class\u201d \u2013 defined by whiteness and social values rather than by an economic relationship \u2013 came into vogue in the late 2000s, with \n as \u201cBritain\u2019s betrayed tribe\u201d, claiming they\u2019d been \u201cpushed to the margins by the politicians\u201d for whom they had voted for generations because of New Labour\u2019s \u201cdivisive and wasteful\u201d promotion of multiculturalism. \nToday, siren voices \n that Labour learn from its defeat by throwing off the \u201cyoke of the woke\u201d. The Tories indeed intend to pour accelerant on the so-called \u201cculture war\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for stoking resentment at minorities and their struggles for equality. This was evidenced by their \nthe court of appeal blocking the deportation of people who came here as children over convictions including drug offences. Yet Labour\u2019s historic mission \u2013 however inconsistent it has sometimes been \u2013 needs restating: to advance the interests of working people and to combat oppression against women and minorities. That was always based on the recognition that the working class on the one hand and women and minorities on the other were not separate categories, but impossible to disentangle. That\u2019s why Clement Attlee was a founding member of the\n, and why under Labour\u2019s watch laws partially decriminalised homosexuality, legalised abortion, forbade discrimination against women and minorities, and finally repealed all anti-gay laws.\nAs such, Labour has always been pilloried for championing minorities and women. In the 1980s, Labour councils were described by the press as the \u201cloony left\u201d for advocating for LGBTQ rights. In 1987, Neil Kinnock\u2019s then press officer, Patricia Hewitt, wrote a letter warning that \u201cthe \u2018loony Labour left\u2019 is taking its toll: the gay and lesbians issue is costing us dear among the pensioners\u201d. It is indeed worth noting that in 1987, two-thirds of Britons \n that same-sex relations were \u201calways wrong\u201d. Should Labour therefore have thrown LGBTQ people under a bus as a matter of electoral expedience in the late 1980s?\nFew would now admit they think Labour should have done as such now: but just look at what has become perhaps the totemic issue of so-called \u201cwoke\u201d politics \u2013 trans rights. The tunes being played against trans people today are straight from the press campaigns against gay and bisexual people in the 1980s and 1990s. Piers Morgan has \n his shame over describing EastEnders\u2019 first gay kiss as a \u201chomosexual love scene between yuppie poofs\u201d in the 1980s, but lacks the reflection to wonder whether he will be driven to make the same apologies in 30 years over \n about gender.\nLong before the Corbyn era, New Labour found itself demonised as the high priests of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d: who can forget Harriet Harman parodied as \u201cHarriet Harperson\u201d, and the likes of Peter Hitchens \n they were achieving their revolutionary aims through \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and \u201copen borders\u201d. Not that New Labour should be absolved of their role in today\u2019s backlash. They stopped talking about the working class, but championed the rights of LGBTQ people and women, creating the false impression that they were mutually exclusive; they presided over a growing housing crisis, which allowed the right to claim that working-class people were forced to compete for scarce resources with foreigners; and as people from EU accession states came to the UK, they refused to make a pro-migrant argument. All of this fed the myth that the interests of working-class people and minorities were counterposed: that \u201cyou only care about them, you don\u2019t care about us\u201d.\nWhoever becomes \n leader, the voices demanding a tack to the right on social issues must be resisted. It would be a betrayal of Labour\u2019s fundamental purpose. It erases the reality of the modern working class, which includes women, people of colour and indeed people who are LGBTQ. It also conjures up an utterly patronising caricature of the working class. The real divide on social issues isn\u2019t based around class, but rather age: younger working-class and middle-class people are significantly more socially progressive than their parents, let alone their grandparents.\nAnd while the under-40s are voting for Labour in unprecedented numbers, they are less partisan than previous generations, and will gladly defect if Labour shifts right on women and minorities. Stand your ground: granting the right victory in its so-called \u201cculture war\u201d is a recipe for both moral and political suicide.\n Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/reshuffle-boris-johnson-pitfalls": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/reshuffle-boris-johnson-pitfalls", "title": "I\u2019ve been on the inside of enough reshuffles to know this one won\u2019t be easy | Paul Harrison", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:24:24 GMT", "summary": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s shake-up has been long in the planning, but the pitfalls are many \u2013 and new enemies are always made</p><p>On Thursday, Boris Johnson is set to conduct his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/09/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle-dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">post-election reshuffle</a>.

That allows a PM to put their personal stamp on an administration, ensuring that the day-to-day decisions reflect overall priorities.\nThis particular reshuffle has long been planned. That\u2019s not always the case. Some of the reshuffles in Theresa May\u2019s time as PM were conducted in what might charitably be deemed a brisk manner.\nI vividly remember having to tell her that the now home secretary, \nwhen on holiday in Israel than she had initially mentioned. (It was a call from this newspaper that first informed me of that fact, as it happens.) Now, May never succumbed to foul language even under the greatest of stress. However, the news I had just delivered \u2013 that ultimately saw \n \u2013 led to probably the fruitiest expression I ever heard her say.\nBut how does a reshuffle actually work? The pressure of governing means there will be lots of what we\u2019ll call strongly held views in No 10 about the relative merits of the existing cabinet ministers. The chief whip will be offering thoughts, in terms of who should be rewarded for good behaviour. There\u2019s also a role for the Cabinet Office\u2019s scary sounding propriety and ethics team, who will be reminding ministers of their responsibilities.\nThose competing views, through a series of meetings, result in the proposed shape of the new cabinet. That gets physical form in a whiteboard that will make its way into the PM\u2019s office (if it isn\u2019t already there). Nametags for the senior people are held on by magnets against the various departments.\nThen the Downing Street switchboard \u2013 always from a withheld number \u2013 will start to place calls asking ministers to take the nervy walk up Downing Street. Sometimes the conversations with those who aren\u2019t continuing in post happen in the PM\u2019s office in the Commons \u2013 in part because TV cameras aren\u2019t allowed outside there.\nIt\u2019s when something unexpected happens that the whiteboard really makes itself useful. Under May, there was a \nrespectively. Hunt wasn\u2019t particularly keen on that idea \u2013 so I was dispatched, as his former adviser, to persuade him of the merits of the move. Suffice to say, it emerged both quickly and fairly robustly that he didn\u2019t think there were any, so we had a talk about the weather and his family before I reported my abject failure back to the PM.\nIt seems an obvious point, but once you\u2019ve started a reshuffle there\u2019s no way of stopping until every position on the whiteboard is actually filled \u2013 and the further into the day you get, the less room for manoeuvre there is with available positions.\nSo while the team attempts to put the odd square peg in the odd round hole, other ministers will be bottlenecked inside No 10 without their phones or any idea of what\u2019s happening. Useful as ever, I was once pressed into service to keep\ncompany. In the process of being made education secretary, he had to spend several hours drinking tea in what used to be Margaret Thatcher\u2019s study. He did discover one of the small mercies of reshuffle day, though \u2013 which is that, generally, a far better selection of biscuits appears.\nWe also learned through bitter experience the consequences of the inadvertent cock-up. A decision had very firmly been made in 2018 not to make Chris Grayling Conservative party chairman, as we tried to project vigour and dynamism. Sadly, that had not been communicated to Tory HQ, \n for an appointment Grayling wasn\u2019t supposed to have had.\nWhat have we learned? Well, \n will never be more powerful as prime minister than he is now. But by the end of the day, and amid all the flattery he will be repaid with from those in post, he will have new enemies too.\n Paul Harrison was Downing Street press secretary from 2017 to 2019 and is senior counsel at Lexington Communications\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/tories-blue-wall-voters-stereotypes": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/tories-blue-wall-voters-stereotypes", "title": "The Tories can\u2019t help \u2018blue wall\u2019 voters unless they understand them | Torsten Bell", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:43:00 GMT", "summary": "People in the party\u2019s new seats are not all as old and badly off as stereotypes suggest<p>In the weeks since the election, the Westminster agenda has been focused on the politics and economics of place.

And it is the desire to hold on to those seats that lies behind its programme of tackling Britain\u2019s damaging geographic divides \u2013 what it calls \n.\nBut defining that programme means understanding those constituencies. Crucially, it means getting beyond stereotypes. Too often we hear these former Labour strongholds characterised as poor, left-behind towns that the young are \n, when the reality is far more complex.\nThe town part of the label is at least broadly true \u2013 these seats are indeed larger towns or smaller cities. More than two-thirds of residents across the 50 constituencies live in towns, compared to just under half of the population as a whole.\nBut these towns and cities are not the poorest parts of Britain. Yes, they are much poorer than traditional Conservative seats \u2013 with typical pay \u00a344 a week lower. But that is really down to the wider north-south divide and higher pay across London and the south-east. If we focus on the regions that these seats sit within, typical earners actually take home \u00a39 a week more on average than in \n seats in the same areas.\nCalling these places old is also wide of the mark. The average age of residents in these seats is 41 \u2013 just 0.7 years above the UK average. This is exactly why these are the new swing seats in Britain \u2013 they are middle-aged in a country that is becoming increasingly polarised by age. And the idea that these seats have seen a youth exodus is simply false: far fewer young people are leaving than in Labour seats, or other Conservative seats. Indeed, fewer people of any age are moving out, or for that matter moving in \u2013 either from other parts of the UK or abroad. As a result, their population growth since 2002 is half that of the rest of the country.\nThe relative economic performance of these seats also poses a challenge for this government \u2013 because while they haven\u2019t historically done worse than the country as a whole, they have certainly been doing so since 2010. Northern regions have generally seen a smaller pay squeeze post-crisis than the south, but these seats have bucked that trend, with pay still down by 2%. They have also missed out on the largely city-based job boom since 2012 and are seeing slower growth in higher-paying jobs than elsewhere. House prices have grown at half the rate of the rest of the country \u2013 although this has brought some benefits, with home-ownership rates above the national average.\nSo while the Tories\u2019 new seats aren\u2019t poorer than the rest of the country, their relative economic decline explains the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda and focus on the specific challenges in those places, as well as its desire to close the broader north-south regional divide. Transport plans need to go well beyond the big intercity trains that \n to more local improvements, strengthening the economies of the blue wall directly. Investing in skills will reinforce such an approach.\nThe government\u2019s attention to its new seats is welcome, but while new road and rail links are needed, they will inevitably take time to arrive. In the meantime the \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda risks being taken backwards by the one big government reform that we know is definitely coming to the blue wall in this parliament \u2013 universal credit. Unintentionally the design of the new benefit system means there will be \n in the north than the south, something that is currently receiving no attention in government.\nOf course, understanding the \n taking places across these seats can only get you so far. It\u2019s equally important to listen to what people want, and appreciate that different areas will have different priorities.\nAll governments need big, clear agendas to help them prioritise. \u201cLevelling up\u201d the new Tory seats, and Britain more generally, is a worthy aim, irrespective of whether it\u2019s partly based on cold electoral logic. And the only way to do it is by starting with facts, not stereotypes.\n Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/boris-johnson-billions-buses-5bn": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/boris-johnson-billions-buses-5bn", "title": "If Boris Johnson really wants to improve the UK\u2019s buses, he should look to Switzerland | Lynn Sloman", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:40:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Local authorities need greater powers, such as those enjoyed by the Swiss, if the prime minister\u2019s \u00a35bn pledge is to help</p><p>Finally, after decades of disastrous, or at best feeble, bus policy, Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes\" title=\"\">\u00a35bn to improve buses</a> suggests that at long last the importance of this neglected mode of transport is being recognised.

But while \u00a35bn could build quite a lot of bus lanes, it will not have much impact on fares and services unless it is accompanied by countrywide regulation of local public transport.\nIn 1985, control over Britain\u2019s buses passed from local authorities to private companies. \n meant that instead of local authorities planning the bus network, private bus operators could decide where and when to run buses, based on which routes were most profitable. It was supposed to lead to an improvement in services, and an increase in the number of people travelling by bus. The Conservative government at the time said that \u201cwithout the dead hand of restrictive regulation, fares could be reduced on many bus routes and the operator would still make a profit. New and better services would be provided. More people would travel.\u201d\nBut deregulation had the opposite effect: fares rose, services worsened and bus use fell. The decline was most catastrophic in the places that previously had the highest levels of bus travel. According to census data for 1981 and 2001, 41% of workers in Sheffield travelled by bus at the beginning of the 1980s, but two decades later that figure had halved to 19%.\nWith bus operators focusing on the most profitable routes, the lack of services elsewhere was addressed in part by local authorities paying for extra \u201csocially necessary\u201d journeys. That worked to a degree, though it meant that bus services increasingly came to be seen as a basic safety net rather than an essential public service.\nAusterity cuts from 2010 meant that councils had to make impossible choices between funding for social care and funding for transport. Not surprisingly, it was \n. The result was a further slashing of services, especially in rural areas.\nIronically, it was the Conservative chancellor George Osborne who finally recognised that deregulation had been a failure. Three years ago the government legislated to allow large local authorities with elected mayors to \n again. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, seems likely to be the \n, though the process that his transport authority has to go through to get the regulatory powers has been complicated and drawn out. Local authorities outside the big conurbations were not given this power, however.\nOver on the continent, Switzerland embarked on a very different journey. Just two years after buses were deregulated in the UK, the canton of Zurich passed a law specifying the \n citizens could expect: an hourly service for settlements of 300 people; a half-hourly service for people living on main corridors; and a service at least every 15 minutes for residents of dense urban areas. All services were to run from 6am to midnight, seven days a week.\nThe difference in the destinations reached by the respective countries is stark: the average citizen of Zurich canton makes \n in equivalent areas in England. One part of the UK did not suffer bus deregulation in the 1980s \u2013 in London, services stayed under public control. While bus trips outside London halved over the following 30 years, use in the capital doubled. Londoners now make as many local bus, Underground and local train trips each year as the citizens of Zurich canton.\nAs a result of deregulation, the public sector can only provide capital for bus lanes, but it can\u2019t specify what services will run on them, or how often, or at what fares. And worst of all, it can\u2019t design a complete network. So right now, Boris Johnson\u2019s billions will have a limited impact. The only way to improve bus travel in the UK is to reverse deregulation and provide local authorities with Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate their bus services, coupled with ongoing funding for a comprehensive offering that enables convenient travel any time of day, any day of the week, between any two places bigger than a small village. And so far, there are no hints of that happening.\nAside from the important function of providing transport from A to B, buses now have an increasingly important role to play in tackling the climate emergency. To stand any chance of meeting the \n targets, we will have to cut the amount of driving we do. That implies some restraint on car use, which will only command public consent if it happens in parallel with recognition that people have a right to decent, affordable alternative ways of travelling. Action on the climate emergency doesn\u2019t just require a few more electric buses, it requires Swiss-style public transport so that buses become not just a better form of transport, but our main form of transport.\nSo one cheer for Johnson recognising that buses are important and that they deserve at least \u00a35bn. But I\u2019ll only be giving three cheers if he follows up with an announcement of Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate services. The UK has been travelling in the wrong direction for too long, it\u2019s not too late to hop off.\n Lynn Sloman is director of \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/protection-law-politicians-judges-courts": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/protection-law-politicians-judges-courts", "title": "This government has plans that would destroy the protection of the law | Charles Falconer", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:00:28 GMT", "summary": "<p>We cannot let politicians have power over who becomes a judge, or put some issues beyond the reach of the courts</p><p>On Sunday, the lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, said he would <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7983775/Robert-Buckland-vows-fight-bid-make-judges-political-appointments.html\" title=\"\">resist attempts to politicise and weaken the judiciary</a>.

He said he would uphold his oath as lord chancellor to protect judges\u2019 independence. He\u2019s taking on his own government and we should support him.\nThe Tory manifesto included a pledge to restrict the courts\u2019 powers to take on the government. It characterised some recent judicial review findings against the government as abusive \u2013 the ruling \n and the \n are presumably what they had in mind. This government is determined to prevent the courts from being a fetter on what it wants to do.\nIt has two muzzles in mind. First, giving politicians greater influence over the appointment of senior judges, and second, taking some big government decisions that affect politics out of judicial review. No 10 briefed, the night before the Queen\u2019s speech in December, either ignorantly or deceitfully, of decreasing the power of the supreme court, and increasing the power of the lord chancellor. It claims to fear the UK court becoming like the US supreme court which decides big political issues such as abortion or desegregation.\nIn the US there is a written constitution which sets limits on what Congress can do. The US supreme court determines what those limits are. The constitution, for example, determines whether everyone has a right to choose whether to have an abortion. In the UK, where there is no written constitution, parliament is sovereign. It decides whether abortion should be permitted. Once parliament has decided an issue like that the courts cannot interfere. And they don\u2019t.\nProf Richard Ekins, the head of the judicial power project at the government\u2019s favourite thinktank, Policy Exchange, has suggested increasing the lord chancellor\u2019s power to interfere with senior judicial appointments, to ensure that \u201cjudicial activists\u201d don\u2019t get appointed to senior positions. He suggests the lord chancellor should more often use his existing, very limited, powers to reject judges proposed by the independent judicial appointments commission and should be given new power to choose all senior judicial appointments from a shortlist of three.\nThis is wrong-headed. The more politicians are involved in judicial appointments, the more political judges will become. Not in the sense that they will start to decide issues like abortion, but that they will start to decide cases in a way that will get them promoted by politicians. At the heart of Ekins\u2019s independence-reducing idea is the view that some \u2013 not all \u2013 judges do not respect the supremacy of parliament and, for example, construe statutes in ways that do not give effect to the intention of parliament, or decide judicial review cases in a way that seeks to frustrate the will of parliament. Giving the politicians more say in weeding out those judges who are too \u201cactivist\u201d will, he believes, ensure a cadre of senior judges who respect the line between the courts and politics. As he must know, it will lead to judges who defer to the executive being promoted more.\nThe other prong of the No 10 plan to weaken the supreme court is to declare, by statute, that cases such as the prorogation one last year, which involve the exercise of the royal prerogative, are beyond the reach of the courts \u2013 they are non-justiciable. This would have prevented the supreme court finding that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful.\nStrengthening the role of the lord chancellor is No 10\u2019s sweetener for the reduction of the power and independence of the supreme court. The only measure it has mentioned so far is specifying that the lord chancellor should be a lawyer. Yes, that would help to avoid Titanic disasters such as \n or \n. But you can always find an amenable lawyer. Among the casualties of Harold Macmillan\u2019s night of the long knives cabinet reshuffle was Lord Kilmuir, the lord chancellor. He complained he had received less notice than would his cook. Macmillan replied that cooks were a lot harder to come by than lord chancellors.\nThe purpose of the judicial appointments process must above all be to ensure independence of the judges from the executive. If their promotion to the supreme court depends on pleasing the politicians their independence is crucially compromised. The ability of the lord chancellor to remonstrate with the prime minister is no substitute for the courts fearlessly prohibiting unlawful acts, and unscrambling their consequences.\nThe effect of declaring by statute that something is non-justiciable is to declare that it is outside the realm of the law. The courts would be powerless to prevent it \u2013 because it would be for the politicians to resolve. And the lord chancellor, the voice of the law in cabinet, would, rightly, be told that since the issue is outside the realm of the law he or she is the last person with any authority on the issue.\nThe executive can arrest, imprison, remove children, confiscate property, remove union rights, close down parliament indefinitely, close businesses, close publications, declare war, sell arms and break humanitarian law, deport. It is the courts, not the lord chancellor, that prevent the abusive use of these powers. The lord chancellor can protest internally within government or even publicly. And that is of some value as a restraint on a government embarking on flagrantly unlawful conduct, for example, by deliberately breaking an act of parliament \n. But ultimately the courts alone can prohibit unlawful state actions. They are proudly and defiantly independent of the government. They uphold the rights of the citizen against the executive. And do so even in cases where it upsets the government\u2019s political plans.\nThe protection of the law will be destroyed if judicial promotion is dependent on not upsetting the government, and if courts cannot rule on cases that might embarrass the state. The lord chancellor needs all our support to stop this.\n Lord Falconer was lord chancellor in Tony Blair\u2019s government\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections", "title": "These three post-Brexit bills bulldoze a hole through environmental protections | Fiona Harvey", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 06:30:25 GMT", "summary": "<p>Wildlife, air quality and fish stocks are all at risk as ministers water down EU regulations</p><p>Hedgehogs, yellowhammers and dormice did not figure highly in the EU referendum campaign, but they may turn out to be some of the first losers from Brexit.

Now we can see the worth of those promises, in a trio of bills set before parliament. The \n, \n and \n replace the EU\u2019s comprehensive framework directives, common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy.\nAll three bills contain major flaws that undermine the government\u2019s claims. They leave gaps, fail on enforcement and oversight, open loopholes for future ministers to quietly backslide from existing standards, and turn what is currently a coherent system of long-term, stable regulation into a patchwork of competing and sometimes contradictory proposals.\nTake the environment bill. It sets out four priority areas, some of them critical for human health: air quality, waste and resource efficiency, water and nature. \n contributes to 40,000 deaths a year, and the new bill sets out a framework for standards on key pollutants. Yet although this bill could be law within a few months, the new standards on air \u2013 along with those on the other three priority areas \u2013 will not be set until October 2022.\nThe government says the delay is to give time for expert input. Parents \n to get their breathless children to A&E every time there is a \n might take the view that the World Health Organization, the EU and \n have already answered the questions over what constitutes breathable air. Why do they have to wait more than two years without legal safeguards before even being allowed to know what the new limits will be?\nThe watering down does not stop there. Under the EU\u2019s air quality directive, ministers were obliged not just to adhere to targets for air pollutants but to publish plans showing how the targets would be met. That was where campaigners scored their \n, when they took the government to court over Britain\u2019s filthy air and judges ruled the plans were not valid. The new environment bill dispenses with the need for detailed plans that can be weighed up by experts and used to hold government to account. Instead, ministers will be required only to set out the steps they intend to take, without accountability as to whether those measures are sufficient.\nNew powers have also been quietly inserted for the government to derogate from high standards at will. Clause 81 of the environment bill gives the secretary of state powers to weaken targets for the chemical status of our water, either by relaxing the targets or changing the rules by which they are measured.\nTo reassure the public \u2013 who will no longer be able to take the government to the European courts over any failures \u2013 there is to be a watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection. Will it have the same powers as the European courts? No. Will its judgments be binding? Not necessarily. Who will make up its board? Ministers will decide.\nThe agriculture bill and the fisheries bill, while containing some admirable aims, are also worrying. The EU\u2019s common agricultural policy was often disastrous for wildlife and nature, and the government was rightly cheered when it proposed paying farmers for providing public goods \u2013 clean water, good soil, flood protection. But the new system of environmental land management contracts \u2013 to be phased in over seven years \u2013 will be voluntary and the measures farmers will be required to take will be decided at the level of individual farms. This leaves gaps.\nCurrently, there are specific protections for species and habitats that apply across the UK. Under environmental land management contracts, many of those protections \u2013 like the ones for nesting birds and hedgehogs \u2013 will become voluntary. Farmers could pick and choose what protections they sign up to, and those who do not want the public money could opt out altogether. And who will monitor the farmers who do? With ministers wanting to cut the number of farm inspections, enforcement looks hazy too.\nJettisoning the EU\u2019s \n also offered ministers a chance to stop rampant overfishing. They have not taken it. The bill retains a broad aim to restore stocks to \u201cmaximum sustainable yield\u201d \u2013 the level, worked out by scientists, at which fishing does not harm the ability of the fish population to reproduce. But the fishing quotas each year are still to be set by ministers, with the power to depart from that scientific advice, and to choose which stocks will be fished sustainably and which will not.\nUnless the government accepts amendments to these vital bills in the coming weeks and months, the UK will be quietly swapping an agreed set of outcomes and stringent environmental protections for a set of vague promises, voluntary measures, and deliberately loose and leaky legislation.

But the longer this segregation of political cultures goes on, the harder it gets to argue for a United Kingdom.\nSturgeon is counting on Brexit to drive divergence to the point where independence feels irresistible. Two-thirds of Scots wanted to stay in the EU, and their ejection from it on Boris Johnson\u2019s terms reinforces old resentment of rule by remote English Tories. Sturgeon hopes fresh anger will keep her party buoyant through next year\u2019s Scottish parliament elections despite a heavy freight of incumbency. The SNP has been running Scotland for nearly 13 years \u2013 time enough to write a catalogue of troubles, of which the Mackay saga is just an appendix. Later this year Alex Salmond, Sturgeon\u2019s predecessor, \n over allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape.\nSo far the SNP has relied on the inadequacy of the opposition to weather storms, and there is no sign of that shelter being withdrawn. If you had forgotten his name, Richard Leonard is Labour\u2019s Scottish leader but not the answer to any other questions. His party has \n of a second independence referendum, and not just because Jeremy Corbyn was eyeing deals with the SNP to build a Commons majority. The radical English left already had a soft spot for Scottish nationalism. Corbyn likes causes that parade as liberation struggles, and avoids positions that involve defence of the British state in its established form. A similar impulse persuades Scottish Greens to support independence.\nNon-aligned unionists miss Ruth Davidson\u2019s voice in the debate. The former Tory leader in Edinburgh was an adept reader of Scottish politics, and proved it by \n rather than waste her skills defending Johnson.\nThe SNP benefits also from a shift in attitudes since \n. Polls show discernible movement towards independence, driven by remainers who voted no in 2014. There is demographic momentum too. Younger voters like independence. But Sturgeon\u2019s strongest card is the total capture of Westminster by Tories, with the prime minister\u2019s anglocentric swagger providing bonus repulsion of Scottish voters.\nJohnson\u2019s administration also makes it hard for non-Tories in England to plead the unionist cause. In theory, ancient bonds are precious under any government, and as worthy of defence outside the EU as in it. Tories can be ousted, while cutting the UK\u2019s constitutional cord is forever. Anti-Brexit arguments should also translate into rebuttal of the case for \n. In both scenarios it is unwise, impractical and expensive to repaint borders that progress had erased. But fewer remainers have the heart to push that line when the union whose virtues they must extol has Boris, Brexiteer Supreme, as its champion.\nFacing at least five years of Tory government, many English voters might envy the Scots their referendum escape raft and their dreams of sailing it back to Europe. Sturgeon was in Brussels on Monday advertising her readiness for that journey. Even if it looks like a long shot, plenty of demoralised remainers will root for her if the alternative is cultural capitulation to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage.\nWhile moderate unionist voices are muted, the noisiest opponents of Scottish separation are tin-eared Tories who can\u2019t praise the heritage of Great Britain without sounding as if they mostly mean England. Even if Johnson aims for an emollient tone he will be quickly baited into confrontation with the SNP over demands for a referendum. The Tory leader has only two settings: frivolous and contemptuous. He visibly struggles not to despise those whom he cannot entertain.\nIncumbency will also weigh on the Tories. Brexit promises will be pulped in the negotiating mill, and foreigners will be blamed. Johnson will sound increasingly like an English nationalist. The prime minister thinks his permissive social attitudes and free-trader rhetoric make him a liberal. It is true, up to a point. Yet that point is reached whenever expediency requires a tilt into chauvinism and xenophobia. Johnson embodies a common delusion that the English are inherently resistant to nationalism, seen as a vulgar condition afflicting less pragmatic nations.\nScotland\u2019s independence campaigners have a similar trick, insisting theirs is the good kind of nationalism \u2013 \u201ccivic\u201d, \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2013 not like the mean, atavistic strain that sows conflict and division. They too have a point. Sturgeon is no despot, and the SNP has egalitarian intent. But the test is not the ambition with which nationalism starts, it is the turn taken when utopia is not reached. The beginning is always democracy, freedom and romance. The end is always disappointment and a hunt for traitors. Nationalists never own their mistakes because there is always some remnant of the old regime or a foreign neighbour to scapegoat.\nWhether the bad guys are in Brussels or Westminster, the model has the same flaw. The idea that the collective destiny of a nation can be truly expressed only by the victory of one party or one leader is a well-trodden historical dead end. Nationalism rejects the moral validity of rival programmes. It demotes tolerance and, when short of fuel, taps the rage of fanatics. It is poisonous to liberal democracy, although democratic principle demands it be given space on a ballot paper. Once there, it stands out in bold colours against politicians who deal in grey shades of complexity.\nThose of us who wanted to stay in the EU, and also want to keep the union of England and \n, lack compelling stories to rival the myths that drive separatism. It is a grimly familiar sensation \u2013 watching from the sidelines, muttering boring old facts while the fate of our country is settled by better storytellers. History is meant to be our vaccine against nationalism, but it doesn\u2019t work when we let nationalists rewrite the past in order to spell out the future in their own words.\n Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/woods-and-irons-winners-and-losers-in-the-path-of-hs2": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/woods-and-irons-winners-and-losers-in-the-path-of-hs2", "title": "Woods and irons: Winners and losers in the path of HS2", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 06:00:24 GMT", "summary": "<p>South Cubbington Wood will be partially destroyed because of HS2, but local golf club spared </p><p>The news that Rose Guiot had been dreading for the past decade was confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.

The 71-year-old retired engineer has long argued that the high speed rail line that will travel through the countryside between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds should be cancelled entirely.\n\u201cOver the last ten years, I\u2019ve read countless documents on the project and written 400 blog posts on the matter and on all the grounds I\u2019ve looked at it, from transport, the environment and financial perspective, it doesn\u2019t actually make any sense,\u201d he said.\nWhile Delow has accepted that his efforts to stop the project through parliament have failed, a group of activists have set up a protest camp to stop South Cubbington Wood being destroyed. Among the group was Martin Newman, an accountant, who said that as well as the environmental impact, costwise the project has gotten \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\u201cThe cost has jumped from \u00a356bn in 2015 to as much as \u00a3106bn as of this month. \n. We need investment in infrastructure, but it\u2019s concentrating that investment in a narrow area,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact the \n line will likely be paused.\nBut for Lucy, who has worked for the past 15 years as a headhunter in global mega-projects, the railway is \n and would be hugely beneficial for local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ageing infrastructure, as a lot of reports show. It costs a lot more to upgrade all the existing Victorian infrastructure than to build new routes.\u201d\nThe 37-year-old, who lives in Leamington Spa, added: \u201cWe used to be the forefront of the infrastructure, but if we don\u2019t invest, we will start to fall behind.\u201d She pointed to China, Japan and some European high speed rail as examples to emulate to kickstart the local economies in the north and Midlands, especially after Brexit.\nDarren Galloway, who is self-employed and lives in Nuneaton, echoed Lucy\u2019s points. The 40-year-old said: \u201cUnfortunately there are a lot of outdated and very narrow minded views from residents which do not allow for the development of the country let alone the area, for the benefit of the future generations.\u201d\nBut Penny McGregor, among the protestors at South Cubbington Wood, said there wasn\u2019t enough focus on the impact HS2 will have on local farmers. The high speed railway will go through a chunk of her father\u2019s farmland, which has impacted him both emotionally and financially, she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \n is really thinking about what he is actually doing and the destruction he is causing by saying \u2018let\u2019s go ahead with it\u2019. Many farmers are in distress; there is a lot of depression and anxiety associated with this project,\u201d she said.\nMcGregor said that when she heard the news that the government had given the green light to the project, she felt like there was a dagger through her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s just a train for goodness sake, it\u2019s just a train. You don\u2019t have to destroy so many lives for a train.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/11/the-hs2-go-ahead-leaves-heathrows-third-runway-up-in-the-air": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/11/the-hs2-go-ahead-leaves-heathrows-third-runway-up-in-the-air", "title": "HS2 go-ahead leaves Heathrow's third runway up in the air | Nils Pratley", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:43:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>Few of the arguments which won the day for a high-speed rail project apply to the airport expansion.

First, \u00a39bn has been spent on the \u00a3100bn-ish project already. Second, \n that there are no \u201cshovel ready\u201d alternatives to add rail capacity.\nThe latter factor represents a disgraceful failure of planning by the Department for Transport.

Faced with shouts from the construction industry that builders will go bust if deprived of their HS2 bonanza, \n took the easy political route.\nThose of us who believe \n to spend \u00a3100bn on improving the railways, and quicker ways to deliver \u201clevelling up\u201d benefits, have lost. The only consolation is that recasting phase 2 to make it integrate properly with Northern Powerhouse Rail is a sensible rejig if HS2 is happening. Even so, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool would do well to check the small print of the \u201chigh-speed north\u201d ambition; it sounds vague and thus vulnerable to downgrade.\nYet Johnson\u2019s more intriguing remark was the one about Heathrow, the other big infrastructure conundrum. Asked in the Commons if he still intended \n to stop a third runway, the prime minister replied: \u201cI see no bulldozers at present, nor any prospect of them arriving.\u201d\nIt was a throwaway answer and, as things stand, the first part was 100% accurate; Heathrow will only \n its detailed planning application towards the end of this year. Yet \u201cno prospect\u201d is interesting because it plays into the current political buzz that the mood is turning against Heathrow.\nAside from Johnson\u2019s long-standing personal opposition to expansion at Heathrow, there are strong political reasons to refuse a third runway, as Larry Elliott \n recently. Putney and Richmond Park, two constituencies under the flight path, were among the few Tory losses in December\u2019s general election; after approving the environmentally damaging HS2, Johnson might recover some green ground; and a no to more south-east infrastructure might score more \u201clevelling up\u201d points.\nWhat\u2019s more, neither of the arguments that carried \n over the line apply at Heathrow. There are few sunk costs and the main loser would be Heathrow\u2019s owners, a consortium headed by Spanish firm Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority. As for shovel readiness, the argument would be that no shovels are needed.\nBusiness would grumble but one can imagine Johnson inviting London\u2019s boardroom brigade to get Birmingham International to provide more flights to Asia. As economist Jim O\u2019Neill pointed out, HS2 promises a journey of 38 minutes from \n Euston to Birmingham Interchange.\nNever underestimate the power of the Heathrow lobby, which is just as determined as HS2\u2019s, but it suddenly looks very easy for a PM with a large majority to kill the third runway. Go for it.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority did fine work when it \n Sainsbury\u2019s plainly anti-competitive proposed takeover of Asda, but the watchdog looks ridiculous in getting so upset about JD Sports\u2019 \n.\nThe \u00a390m deal, which has already happened, \u201c\n\u201d, thinks the CMA. Substantially? Footasylum wasn\u2019t enjoying much success on the competitive front, which is why its board surrendered to JD last year at a price that was half the flotation valuation of 2017.\nThe CMA says fewer discounts and less choice could \u201cparticularly affect younger customers and students\u201d. The boffins\u2019 concern is touching but, come on, modern youth knows how to shop around online.\nThe biggest problem in the trainers and sportswear market is surely the pricing power enjoyed by Nike and Adidas. It\u2019s not obvious that liberating Footasylum would improve matters one jot.\nOcado co-founder Tim Steiner \n, a function of a booming share price and a super-charged one-off incentive scheme that was established five years ago. Quite why he needed the highly unusual incentive in the first place has never been adequately explained. Other shareholders probably let it slip through because Ocado, in those days, was struggling.\nNow, of course, the company has a fair claim to being the UK\u2019s most successful technology outfit. It\u2019s worth \u00a38.5bn, supermarkets around the world are snapping up its kit and Steiner\u2019s stake is worth nearly \u00a3300m. That is why the \u00a335,000 bump in his salary to \u00a3720,000, supposedly to keep him motivated, is bizarre. Surely, with that slug of shares, he\u2019s already incentivised to get up in the morning.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/10/martin-rowson-political-message-oscars-academy-awards-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-cartoon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/10/martin-rowson-political-message-oscars-academy-awards-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-cartoon", "title": "Martin Rowson on a political message from the Oscars \u2013 cartoon", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 20:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/10/martin-rowson-political-message-oscars-academy-awards-dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/09/nicola-jennings-on-boris-and-huawei": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/09/nicola-jennings-on-boris-and-huawei", "title": "Nicola Jennings on Boris and Huawei", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 22:31:06 GMT", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/09/nicola-jennings-on-boris-and-huawei\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/08/if-there-was-an-oscar-for-boris-johnsons-performance-cartoon": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/08/if-there-was-an-oscar-for-boris-johnsons-performance-cartoon", "title": "If there was an Oscar for Boris Johnson's performance\u2026 \u2013 cartoon", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 18:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Chris Riddell imagines the prime minister\u2019s acceptance speech<br></p><p><a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/products/9th-february-2020\">\u2022You can buy your own print of this cartoon</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/feb/08/if-there-was-an-oscar-for-boris-johnsons-performance-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/keir-starmer-calls-for-end-to-scandal-of-spiralling-student-debt": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/keir-starmer-calls-for-end-to-scandal-of-spiralling-student-debt", "title": "Keir Starmer calls for end to 'scandal' of spiralling student debt", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 22:00:15 GMT", "summary": "<p>Labour leadership frontrunner would keep party\u2019s policy of scrapping tuition fees</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> would keep Labour\u2019s policy of scrapping student <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/tuition-fees\">tuition fees</a> if he became the party\u2019s leader, he has announced, in a fresh attempt to demonstrate he would not ditch Corbynism wholesale.</p><p>The pledge to abolish the \u00a39,000 annual fees was one of the most eye-catching policies in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/21/labour-abolish-university-tuition-fees-jeremy-corbyn-eu-uk-europe\">Labour\u2019s manifesto for the 2017 general election</a>, and also featured in 2019.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/keir-starmer-calls-for-end-to-scandal-of-spiralling-student-debt\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": " would keep Labour\u2019s policy of scrapping student \n if he became the party\u2019s leader, he has announced, in a fresh attempt to demonstrate he would not ditch Corbynism wholesale.\nThe pledge to abolish the \u00a39,000 annual fees was one of the most eye-catching policies in \n, and also featured in 2019.\nIn a statement released by his campaign team, Starmer said: \u201cLabour must stand by its commitment to end the national scandal of spiralling student debt and abolish tuition fees.

That is why I would urge the chancellor to use next month\u2019s budget to invest in the next generation by restoring maintenance grants for students in further and higher education.\u201d\nBallot papers for the leadership contest are expected to be posted out next week, and the result is due to be announced on 4 April.\nThe field appears likely to be narrowed down to three at the end of this week.

It means parliament\u2019s sitting is suspended and it ends all current legislation under discussion. It is usual for this to happen every autumn. The current parliamentary session, which began in June 2017, is the longest in almost 400 years.\nYou cannot do anything in Westminster without a bit of pomp and circumstance. A ceremony of prorogation involves a message from the Queen being read in the \n, and then Black Rod summoning MPs from the Commons to the Lords. A list of all the bills passed by the parliament is read, followed by a speech on behalf of the Queen announcing what has been achieved by the government before MPs are sent home. Given what is on the order paper in parliament on Monday, this is likely to happen very late this evening.\nThere are a number of highly irregular factors at play here. For prorogation to last more than a month is unprecedented in recent times. For example, since the 1980s prorogation has typically lasted less than a week.\n includes a three-week period that would typically be recess anyway, during which the Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative party conferences are held, but is nevertheless longer than usual.\nMost obviously, though, the country is approaching the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU. Parliament has been working to pass a law that would prevent the UK crashing out without a deal, regardless of the fact that Boris Johnson has promised to leave on that date \u201c\n\u201d. With no deal agreed, and noises off suggesting the government might ignore any law requiring them to agree an extension with the EU, some politicians have been dismayed that parliament will not be sitting while the situation remains unresolved.\nAll work on legislation going through parliament stops. The government can, in some circumstances, carry over a bill into the next session \u2013 but only time will tell whether Johnson\u2019s priorities for government match the legislation that had started its progress through the house when Theresa May was in charge. There are some particular concerns that a lot of cross-party work and campaigning on \n will now go to waste.\nAll committees stop too \u2013 so Wednesday\u2019s scheduled appearance by the prime minister at the Commons liaison committee is cancelled, and after last week\u2019s debut, it will now be several weeks before Johnson faces another PMQs.\nNo. The timing of prorogation is entirely in the hands of the government, although there have been failed attempts in the courts to prevent it.\nJohnson intends for parliament to return on 14 October with a Queen\u2019s speech, which he says will \u201cbring forward an ambitious new legislative programme for MPs\u2019 approval\u201d.\nHe will then almost immediately have to head to Europe for the vital EU council, which is the last chance for him to obtain a new \n deal or to ask for an extension of article 50.\nAssuming MPs do not vote for a general election on Monday \u2013 and all the indications are that they will not \u2013the earliest the UK can have a general election will be in November.

And we want to change \u2013 this is the right thing for the world and for BP,\u201d Looney said.\nBP\u2019s green goals have divided environmental campaigners. Some welcomed the company\u2019s ambition; others criticised the absence of a clear strategy.\nMurray Worthy, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said BP\u2019s net zero pledge \u201clooks like an attempt to grab some positive headlines by a new CEO but with little of substance to show how it will achieve these grand claims.\n\u201cThere is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible. Saying that they will invest more in low-carbon tech and less in oil and gas \u2018over time\u2019 is not a credible plan for reaching net zero. The science is clear that this shift has to happen immediately.\u201d\nThe ambitions were welcomed by Climate Action 100+, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and the Church of England Commissioners, which have all collaborated with BP\u2019s executives to help tackle the climate crisis.\nStephanie Pfeifer, a member of Climate Action 100+ and the chief executive of the IIGCC, said investors would continue to look for progress from BP including how it would invest more in non-oil and gas businesses and ensure its lobbying activity supports delivery of the Paris agreement.\nLooney told investors the company plans to keep growing its cashflows and shareholder distributions over the long term, raising concerns over whether it will reduce the amount of oil and gas that it produces.\nAn \n revealed that the company planned to grow its production of oil and gas by about a fifth between 2018 and 2030, despite warnings that an increase in fossil fuel production would put the world on track for catastrophic global heating and a runaway climate crisis.\nLooney said: \u201cWe all want energy that is reliable and affordable but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner. To deliver that, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world\u2019s energy system.\n\u201cIt will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it. This will certainly be a challenge but also a tremendous opportunity.\u201d \nBP said it aimed to play a more active role in lobbying for policies that would spur climate action, and cut its spending on corporate reputational sponsorship and redirect the funds towards promoting climate action.\nThe company has faced growing public protests over its sponsorship of the arts in recent months. This month the Guardian became the first major global news organisation to \n.\nLooney set out the plans for a greener BP alongside an overhaul of the company, under a new leadership team.

Aiming for net zero is not only the right thing for BP, it is the right thing for our shareholders and for society more broadly.\n\u201cAs we embark on this ambitious agenda, we will maintain a strong focus on safe, reliable and efficient operations and on delivering the promises we have made to our investors.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/uk-ban-sale-petrol-diesel-cars-shapps-transport": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/uk-ban-sale-petrol-diesel-cars-shapps-transport", "title": "UK could ban sale of petrol and diesel cars in 12 years, says Shapps", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:44:50 GMT", "summary": "<p>Transport secretary\u2019s disclosure of earlier target likely to rattle carmakers</p><p>The government could ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2032, three years earlier than previously suggested, the transport secretary has said.</p><p>A consultation launched last week suggested all cars with internal combustion engines could be banned from 2035 but Grant Shapps told BBC radio on Wednesday the ban could come within 12 years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/uk-ban-sale-petrol-diesel-cars-shapps-transport\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The government could ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2032, three years earlier than previously suggested, the transport secretary has said.\nA consultation launched last week suggested all cars with internal combustion engines could be banned from 2035 but \n told BBC radio on Wednesday the ban could come within 12 years.\nThe ban would happen by 2035 \u2013 or even 2032, subject to consultation, he said.\nThe comments will add to the concerns of the car industry, which has \n for \u201cmoving the goalposts\u201d with its earlier announcement that the limits could come by 2035, from an initial expectation of a 2040 ban.\nMike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said it was a \u201cdate without a plan\u201d.\nPrevious proposals also excluded some hybrid cars, which combine internal combustion engines with battery electric power.\nHybrids are seen by carmakers as a key way of reducing the carbon footprint of their vehicles, and multiple companies such as Toyota and the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, have bet \n.\nShapps and Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, will meet the SMMT on Thursday, with the lobby group hoping to persuade the government that the industry will need more help to achieve the targets.\nAmong the main concerns for carmakers are incentives such as grants for electric cars as well as building national infrastructure capable of charging millions of vehicles.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Department for \n recorded 22,596 registrations of ultra-low emission vehicles, which includes electric cars \u2013 39% more than the same period in the previous year.

Shell was second with $524bn, followed by Chevron on $360bn and \n on $332bn.\nAutumn Hanna, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said: \u201cFor decades, oil and gas companies have been pocketing trillion-dollar profits and padding their bottom line with tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies. All while passing the buck on climate change.\u201d\nMel Evans, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the big oil companies knew the danger that their products posed to the climate well before it became common knowledge but pursued profits above the wider interests of the planet.\n\u201cWhy did they continue to promote those products and dispute science they knew to be correct? Why are they still spending hundreds of billions of dollars on making the problem worse, drilling for new oil and gas we can\u2019t possibly afford to burn?\u201d Evans said. \n\u201cThese figures provide the answer. Money is like rocket fuel: burn through enough of it and you can escape the pull of the Earth. But there\u2019s nowhere else to go.\u201d\nExperts say the decades-long boom is coming to an end as clean energy replaces fossil fuels. Last week Jim Cramer, the influential host of the US investment show Mad Money, said he was \u201cdone with fossil fuels\u201d because they had entered a \u201cdeath knell phase\u201d.\n companies have been the worst-performing investments in US stock markets over the past decade, after leading major stock market indices in previous decades. The market value of oil and gas companies now makes up only 4% of the S&P500 index, compared with about 28% in the 1980s.\n\u201cIf you go back to 1990 you can really see that oil and gas companies once outperformed the market,\u201d said Kathy Hipple, a financial analyst at the Institute for \n Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\u201cBut the market looks to the future and there has been a gradual awareness that fossil fuels are not going to be as big a part in the world economy. This doesn\u2019t mean that [oil companies] will go away tomorrow, but the market won\u2019t reward them for the profits of the past.\u201d\nLast year a \n that 20 fossil fuel giants including BP, Shell, Chevron and Exxon were directly linked to more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. \nThe big four investor-owned corporations were found to be behind more than 10% of all carbon emissions since 1965.\nThe \n project \n how many of the leading fossil fuel corporations had spent billions of pounds on lobbying governments and portraying themselves as environmentally responsible. \nA study published last year \n that the largest five market-listed oil and gas companies \u2013 the big four plus Total \u2013 spent nearly $200m each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.\nThe profit figures were calculated in today\u2019s money by using the annual net income attributable to shareholders for each company while taking inflation rates into account. In absolute terms, without inflation, the combined profits since 1990 were a still considerable $1.6tn, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.\nThe profits of the world\u2019s most profitable listed oil companies were dwarfed last year by the financial reports of the Saudi state-owned oil firm Aramco. It listed on the Saudi stock exchange after racking up profits of $111.1bn (\u00a384.7bn) in 2018, which was more than double the profits of Apple and five times those reported by Shell.\nExperts say the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known by industry leaders and politicians, particularly in the US, as far back as the mid-60s. Certainly by 1990 the facts were well known: two years earlier the Nasa scientist James Hansen had raised the alarm about the impact of fossil fuels during a landmark hearing at the US Congress. In 1992, world leaders came together at a summit in Rio to recognise the role carbon emissions were playing and to pledge coordinated action.\nBP did not respond to a request for comment on the findings. \nA spokesperson for Shell said: \u201cJust as reliable, affordable energy has benefited us all, all of society has a role to play in tackling climate change. We\u2019re working hard to develop lower-carbon energy options and meet demand for more and cleaner energy.\u201d\n said it was helping address \u201cthe dual challenge of the world\u2019s growing demand for energy and reducing emissions\u201d.\nChevon said it was taking action to address climate change by \u201clowering the company\u2019s carbon intensity, increasing the use of renewable energy and investing in breakthrough technologies.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps", "title": "UK alignment on EU standards price to pay for trade deal, say MEPs", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:40:09 GMT", "summary": "<p>Vote comes as bloc wields its powers to force change in UK domestic law during transition</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/12/pmqs-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-in-red-wall-seats-won-by-tories-to-lose-out-disproportionately-from-switch-to-universal-credit-report-finds-live-news\">The day\u2019s political news \u2013 live</a></li></ul><p>The European parliament has called on Michel Barnier to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU.</p><p>In a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/uk-alignment-on-eu-standards-price-to-pay-for-trade-deal-say-meps\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The European parliament has called on \n to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU.\nIn a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues.\nAs MEPs gave their seal of approval for the maximalist position, the European commission for the first time wielded its powers under the withdrawal agreement to order the British government to change its domestic law, despite the country having left the EU two weeks ago.\nUnder the terms of the transition period, during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union but none of Brussels\u2019s decision-making institutions, EU law continues to be superior to UK national law.\nThe government was given two months by the commission to amend a levy on heavy trucks on which UK-registered drivers can get a discount.

At the same time, this troubling turn represents a reversion to longstanding US values. Acknowledging that the second half of the 20th century was an anomaly, rather than the norm, raises troubling questions about the nature of US leadership and the fate of multilateralism after Trump.\nAs a resource-rich continental economy separated from Europe and Asia by vast Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the US has always been tempted by isolationism. Thomas Jefferson famously spoke of no entangling alliances. The Monroe doctrine, from 1823, was not just an assertion of US dominance in the western hemisphere but also an effort to keep the US out of European wars.\nIn the 20th century, the US entered the world wars several years late, long after the stakes were clear, and only after being directly provoked by German U-boat attacks and the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor.\nMoreover, the US long sought to advance its interests abroad unilaterally rather than through multilateral engagement. The Monroe doctrine is a case in point. The US\u2019s refusal after the first world war to join the League of Nations is another.\nEqually important, domestic business has long held inordinate sway over US economic and foreign policies. This historical pattern reflects the fact that it was the first country of continental scope to industrialise. Its immense internal market supported the efforts of US entrepreneurs to pioneer the \n in the second half of the 19th century.\nThis was the age of the robber barons, who held sway over not just the US economy but also its politics. For example, the \u201c\n\u201d California railway tycoons (Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker) controlled not just freight rates but also the state legislature. Viewed from this perspective, the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to cater to domestic corporations\u2019 every regulatory whim is firmly in step with US history.\nAmericans\u2019 deep, abiding and historically rooted distrust of government also reinforces isolationism. The view that government only creates problems is not just a product of Fox News. The US\u2019s founders were profoundly suspicious of overweening government, from which they suffered under British colonialism.\nAfter independence from Britain, the fact and then the legacy of slavery created \n to federal interference with local social arrangements and states\u2019 rights. Rallies of \n and the \n by western ranchers are peculiarly American aberrations, but they are also modern-day manifestations of the long-held view that government cannot be trusted and that the best government is one that governs least. Trump and his policies stand squarely in this tradition.\nThe existential threat of the second world war was enough to shock the US out of its isolationist, anti-government tendencies, at least temporarily. Possessing the single strongest economy, along with politicians, including presidents, with \n, the postwar US was able to provide the leadership needed to construct an open, multilateral order.\nBut it was naive to think that this was \u201cthe end of history\u201d \u2013 that the US would continue to exercise this kind of international leadership indefinitely. In the event, growing economic insecurity, together with the rise of identity politics (reflecting the inability of the once-dominant white majority to adjust to the reality of greater socioeconomic diversity), was enough to cause the American body politic to \n to its unilateral, isolationist mindset.\nThe next US president \u2013 whoever she or he may be \u2013 is unlikely to be as committed to free trade, alliance building, and multilateral institutions and rules as the presidents of the second half of the 20th century. But it is still possible to imagine multilateralism without the US. Climate change illustrates the point: Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Paris climate agreement has \n to its targets, nor should it.\nAnother example is how the European Union, China and 15 other countries reacted to Trump\u2019s efforts to paralyse the World Trade Organisation by leaving its appellate body inquorate with too few judges. In response, they set up their own ad hoc, \n to maintain WTO standards and procedures.\nAs this last case demonstrates, the successor to US global leadership must be collective global leadership, with the two largest economies, the EU and China, at its fore. Unlike the US, the EU is making every effort to work with China. Given the inevitable geopolitical tensions, cooperation won\u2019t be easy. But, as the US once understood, it is the only way.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/11/the-hs2-go-ahead-leaves-heathrows-third-runway-up-in-the-air": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/11/the-hs2-go-ahead-leaves-heathrows-third-runway-up-in-the-air", "title": "HS2 go-ahead leaves Heathrow's third runway up in the air | Nils Pratley", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:43:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>Few of the arguments which won the day for a high-speed rail project apply to the airport expansion.

The only consolation is that recasting phase 2 to make it integrate properly with Northern Powerhouse Rail is a sensible rejig if HS2 is happening. Even so, the mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool would do well to check the small print of the \u201chigh-speed north\u201d ambition; it sounds vague and thus vulnerable to downgrade.\nYet Johnson\u2019s more intriguing remark was the one about Heathrow, the other big infrastructure conundrum. Asked in the Commons if he still intended \n to stop a third runway, the prime minister replied: \u201cI see no bulldozers at present, nor any prospect of them arriving.\u201d\nIt was a throwaway answer and, as things stand, the first part was 100% accurate; Heathrow will only \n its detailed planning application towards the end of this year. Yet \u201cno prospect\u201d is interesting because it plays into the current political buzz that the mood is turning against Heathrow.\nAside from Johnson\u2019s long-standing personal opposition to expansion at Heathrow, there are strong political reasons to refuse a third runway, as Larry Elliott \n recently. Putney and Richmond Park, two constituencies under the flight path, were among the few Tory losses in December\u2019s general election; after approving the environmentally damaging HS2, Johnson might recover some green ground; and a no to more south-east infrastructure might score more \u201clevelling up\u201d points.\nWhat\u2019s more, neither of the arguments that carried \n over the line apply at Heathrow. There are few sunk costs and the main loser would be Heathrow\u2019s owners, a consortium headed by Spanish firm Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority. As for shovel readiness, the argument would be that no shovels are needed.\nBusiness would grumble but one can imagine Johnson inviting London\u2019s boardroom brigade to get Birmingham International to provide more flights to Asia. As economist Jim O\u2019Neill pointed out, HS2 promises a journey of 38 minutes from \n Euston to Birmingham Interchange.\nNever underestimate the power of the Heathrow lobby, which is just as determined as HS2\u2019s, but it suddenly looks very easy for a PM with a large majority to kill the third runway. Go for it.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority did fine work when it \n Sainsbury\u2019s plainly anti-competitive proposed takeover of Asda, but the watchdog looks ridiculous in getting so upset about JD Sports\u2019 \n.\nThe \u00a390m deal, which has already happened, \u201c\n\u201d, thinks the CMA. Substantially? Footasylum wasn\u2019t enjoying much success on the competitive front, which is why its board surrendered to JD last year at a price that was half the flotation valuation of 2017.\nThe CMA says fewer discounts and less choice could \u201cparticularly affect younger customers and students\u201d. The boffins\u2019 concern is touching but, come on, modern youth knows how to shop around online.\nThe biggest problem in the trainers and sportswear market is surely the pricing power enjoyed by Nike and Adidas. It\u2019s not obvious that liberating Footasylum would improve matters one jot.\nOcado co-founder Tim Steiner \n, a function of a booming share price and a super-charged one-off incentive scheme that was established five years ago. Quite why he needed the highly unusual incentive in the first place has never been adequately explained. Other shareholders probably let it slip through because Ocado, in those days, was struggling.\nNow, of course, the company has a fair claim to being the UK\u2019s most successful technology outfit. It\u2019s worth \u00a38.5bn, supermarkets around the world are snapping up its kit and Steiner\u2019s stake is worth nearly \u00a3300m. That is why the \u00a335,000 bump in his salary to \u00a3720,000, supposedly to keep him motivated, is bizarre. Surely, with that slug of shares, he\u2019s already incentivised to get up in the morning.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/boris-johnson-billions-buses-5bn": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/boris-johnson-billions-buses-5bn", "title": "If Boris Johnson really wants to improve the UK\u2019s buses, he should look to Switzerland | Lynn Sloman", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:40:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Local authorities need greater powers, such as those enjoyed by the Swiss, if the prime minister\u2019s \u00a35bn pledge is to help</p><p>Finally, after decades of disastrous, or at best feeble, bus policy, Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes\" title=\"\">\u00a35bn to improve buses</a> suggests that at long last the importance of this neglected mode of transport is being recognised.

The Conservative government at the time said that \u201cwithout the dead hand of restrictive regulation, fares could be reduced on many bus routes and the operator would still make a profit. New and better services would be provided. More people would travel.\u201d\nBut deregulation had the opposite effect: fares rose, services worsened and bus use fell. The decline was most catastrophic in the places that previously had the highest levels of bus travel. According to census data for 1981 and 2001, 41% of workers in Sheffield travelled by bus at the beginning of the 1980s, but two decades later that figure had halved to 19%.\nWith bus operators focusing on the most profitable routes, the lack of services elsewhere was addressed in part by local authorities paying for extra \u201csocially necessary\u201d journeys. That worked to a degree, though it meant that bus services increasingly came to be seen as a basic safety net rather than an essential public service.\nAusterity cuts from 2010 meant that councils had to make impossible choices between funding for social care and funding for transport. Not surprisingly, it was \n. The result was a further slashing of services, especially in rural areas.\nIronically, it was the Conservative chancellor George Osborne who finally recognised that deregulation had been a failure. Three years ago the government legislated to allow large local authorities with elected mayors to \n again. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, seems likely to be the \n, though the process that his transport authority has to go through to get the regulatory powers has been complicated and drawn out. Local authorities outside the big conurbations were not given this power, however.\nOver on the continent, Switzerland embarked on a very different journey. Just two years after buses were deregulated in the UK, the canton of Zurich passed a law specifying the \n citizens could expect: an hourly service for settlements of 300 people; a half-hourly service for people living on main corridors; and a service at least every 15 minutes for residents of dense urban areas. All services were to run from 6am to midnight, seven days a week.\nThe difference in the destinations reached by the respective countries is stark: the average citizen of Zurich canton makes \n in equivalent areas in England. One part of the UK did not suffer bus deregulation in the 1980s \u2013 in London, services stayed under public control. While bus trips outside London halved over the following 30 years, use in the capital doubled. Londoners now make as many local bus, Underground and local train trips each year as the citizens of Zurich canton.\nAs a result of deregulation, the public sector can only provide capital for bus lanes, but it can\u2019t specify what services will run on them, or how often, or at what fares. And worst of all, it can\u2019t design a complete network. So right now, Boris Johnson\u2019s billions will have a limited impact. The only way to improve bus travel in the UK is to reverse deregulation and provide local authorities with Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate their bus services, coupled with ongoing funding for a comprehensive offering that enables convenient travel any time of day, any day of the week, between any two places bigger than a small village. And so far, there are no hints of that happening.\nAside from the important function of providing transport from A to B, buses now have an increasingly important role to play in tackling the climate emergency. To stand any chance of meeting the \n targets, we will have to cut the amount of driving we do. That implies some restraint on car use, which will only command public consent if it happens in parallel with recognition that people have a right to decent, affordable alternative ways of travelling. Action on the climate emergency doesn\u2019t just require a few more electric buses, it requires Swiss-style public transport so that buses become not just a better form of transport, but our main form of transport.\nSo one cheer for Johnson recognising that buses are important and that they deserve at least \u00a35bn. But I\u2019ll only be giving three cheers if he follows up with an announcement of Swiss-style powers to regulate and coordinate services. The UK has been travelling in the wrong direction for too long, it\u2019s not too late to hop off.\n Lynn Sloman is director of \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/10/nmc-health-needs-urgent-truth-serum-to-survive-ftse-woes": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/feb/10/nmc-health-needs-urgent-truth-serum-to-survive-ftse-woes", "title": "Healthcare empire NMC should be clear about who owns its shares | Nils Pratley", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:51:58 GMT", "summary": "<p>FCA says it is \u2018making inquiries\u2019 after company says co-chairman\u2019s stake is under legal review</p><p>When at war with short-sellers, especially Carson Block\u2019s feared US outfit Muddy Waters, a company\u2019s best defence is credibility.

The latter element pushed the share price from 800p to 926p on Monday and a takeover, if it happens, would spare the London market from further embarrassment.\nCome on, though, Monday\u2019s tale of potentially misleading disclosures looks bad enough already.

Yorkshire Water is within its rights \n, but the last time a similar-sized firm did so was the mid-1990s.\nIt is virtually impossible from outside to tell if Yorkshire has a decent technical case when it says Ofwat\u2019s stance \u2013 a function of many detailed calculations \u2013 would discourage long-term capital investment. One can, though, say it\u2019s excellent news that we\u2019ll see some CMA action.\nPublic faith in the water industry and its regulator is low and Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans were popular for a reason. Customers have seen too many instances of companies delivering substandard service while showering dividends on their owners.\nScrutiny by a specialist team at the CMA could be a useful air-clearing moment. Remember, the CMA won\u2019t just consider Yorkshire\u2019s plea that the regulator has been too harsh; it is free to rule that Ofwat should have been tougher.\nIn fact, it would be helpful if Yorkshire is joined in the appeal lounge by others. Thames and Northumbrian are the likely candidates and have until the end of this week to decide. The more, the better: a showdown could be exactly what\u2019s required to determine whether a broader revamp of regulation is necessary.\nIntu, the beleaguered owner of Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, is making progress. It now has the name of a potential outside volunteer to chip in a few quid to support a mammoth fundraising effort \u2013 Hong Kong-based Link Real Estate Investment Trust.\nThe open question, though, is whether \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn, the rumoured target for the equity injection, will be enough to repair a horribly stretched balance sheet. The bears say twice as much is needed. Intu, if it can, needs to aim high.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/taking-care-of-business/2019/dec/11/from-driverless-cars-to-smart-ambulances-what-5g-really-means-and-why-it-matters": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/taking-care-of-business/2019/dec/11/from-driverless-cars-to-smart-ambulances-what-5g-really-means-and-why-it-matters", "title": "From driverless cars to smart ambulances: what 5G really means and why it matters", "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:55:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>5G is big news for individuals and businesses.

O2 provided the company with tablets and in-dash data sims, as well as mobile devices for more than 300 employees. This means the company now has real-time information on where each vehicle is at any given time. Drivers are also immediately updated on new tasks while out in the field \u2013 a big upgrade from the paper-based system B&M Waste Services was previously using.\n\u201cOur drivers would go out every day with pieces of paper with their route on, and it wasn\u2019t until these were sent back at the end of the day that we\u2019d know which bins had been emptied or collected,\u201d says Jayne Kennedy, marketing manager at B&M Waste Services. \u201cNow we have tablets in all of the cabs, so we know instantly if a bin has been emptied or if there have been any issues with access.\n\u201cThe drivers document everything there and then, so if someone rings up the customer service team and says: \u2018You haven\u2019t emptied my bin\u2019, they immediately receive an explanation for why that\u2019s happened.\n\u201cPreviously all the drivers had a mobile phone in the cab, but as they were busy emptying customer bins, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily answer straight away,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cWe\u2019d have a customer on the phone wanting to know what was going on, and we\u2019d have to wait to speak to a driver or wait until they returned at the end of the day. That\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve overcome by providing our customers with instant information directly from our vehicles via our customer service team.\u201d\nAny traffic problems or breakdowns are also instantly recorded from the tablets within the vehicles, and this information is also fed through to the customer service team. \u201cAnother benefit for our customers is that if they ring us and request an additional collection, if we\u2019re in the area we can map it on to the route there and then,\u201d says Kennedy.\nHousing 21 provides housing, care and support for thousands of elderly people of modest means across England. With a geographically dispersed workforce covering about 20,000 retirement and extra care apartments, and providing 42,000 hours of social care each week, it\u2019s imperative that staff can easily keep in touch with residents and each other.\nThe organisation\u2019s private and self-contained retirement apartments, for example, allow residents to live independently within a community setting. On-site court managers are a key part of the service, ensuring day-to-day life at the court runs smoothly and providing peace of mind for residents. Housing 21\u2019s mobile devices allow these court managers to engage with people, providing advice and arranging help if required.\nAs a not-for-profit organisation, Housing 21 also needs to keep a close eye on its overheads to demonstrate that it\u2019s providing good value for money for its customers \u2013 not only in terms of the housing it provides but also the services that go with it. Since moving its mobile phone contract to O2, it\u2019s saved around \u00a330,000 per annum by making sure it has the right number of connections on the right tariffs.\nWith the My Business online management tool, all spending on calls and data is properly allocated, too. \u201cOur finance team can pull reports from it, and we can then crossbill back to specific departments or people, so usage of devices and connections gets correctly charged to the right part of the business,\u201d says Stuart Millard, IS service delivery manager at Housing 21.\nAny successful organisation also wants to get new staff up and running as quickly as possible, which in Housing 21\u2019s case often includes providing them with their own phone number. \u201cWe can quickly go into the [O2 My Business] portal and we\u2019ve got a process set up whereby any spare connection is marked with a specific tag, so we can search for a spare connection and we know that it is definitely not being used by anybody else,\u201d says Millard. \u201cThat means we can allocate it out to a new member of staff really quickly.\u201d\nInstant access to essential information has made a big difference to the way frontline officers for Surrey and Sussex police serve local communities. Due to the unpredictable nature of their jobs, police officers often spend most of their time on the road; their office is therefore their car. Mobile devices pre-loaded with apps allow them to complete important tasks from any location, improving collaboration, reducing errors and speeding up the reporting process.\n\u201cThe mobile device we use in policing has an Airwave Pronto software solution, which allows officers and staff to do pretty much anything while they\u2019re out in the community,\u201d says Giles York, chief constable of Sussex police. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to use forms or pens and paper any more, it\u2019s all done on the move for them.\u201d\nHaving important information to hand \u2013 photos and information to confirm a suspect\u2019s identity, for example, or details of a vehicle\u2019s road tax status \u2013 can make a critical difference to officers in the field. This kind of digital policing also means officers don\u2019t have to return to the station during a shift to access, update or input information, which has cut admin by at least an hour per shift per officer. But more importantly, the reduction in paperwork and easy access to information in the field allows for much more visible policing in local communities.\nAs these examples show, the thoughtful deployment of digital technologies can benefit organisations in almost any industry, empowering people and improving customer service.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/taking-care-of-business/2019/dec/11/set-goals-switch-off-social-and-snack-well-how-to-be-more-productive-at-work": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/taking-care-of-business/2019/dec/11/set-goals-switch-off-social-and-snack-well-how-to-be-more-productive-at-work", "title": "Set goals, switch off social and snack well: how to be more productive at work", "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:59:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>With businesses set to gain an extra 18 days a year thanks to improved connectivity, Joy Persaud reminds us how individually we can make small changes to find even more productivity gains at work </p><p>Time is the precious commodity we all want more of.

Here\u2019s what the experts said about how to survive this new wave of transformational technology:\nBy 2025, millions if not billions of devices across the UK will be connected through the 5G network. This expanding influence of the IoT promises to transform business and society.\nImagine being able to monitor every piece of machinery in your business, down to its single components. This changes the way you do maintenance, enabling you to anticipate faults and order in new parts before a breakdown has even happened, saving precious production time. In agriculture, embedding a network of sensors in the soil can help to detect when irrigation is needed, allowing farmers to use water more resourcefully. The examples are endless.\nWhile companies should be thinking about how they can use the IoT, digitisation can\u2019t be about technology for technology\u2019s sake. O2\u2019s chief information officer, Debra Bailey, told delegates that she has always been focused on business outcomes rather than the technology itself.\nAzfar Aslam, senior partner at Nokia Bell Labs, told delegates that the technology investment decision should start with the problem you are trying to solve as a business, rather than the various potential use cases supported by a particular technology.\nThat\u2019s very much the approach that Northumbrian Water Group took when it started to explore, with the help of O2, how it might embrace 5G technology. Martin Jackson, the utility\u2019s head of IT service and operations, told delegates: \u201cWe have to answer the \u2018So what?\u2019 We have to understand as a business what 5G can enable and how that can impact some of the challenges we face, but the conversations don\u2019t naturally start with the technology \u2013 they start with some of the outcomes we want to achieve in the business.\u201d\nUber didn\u2019t invent taxis. Apple didn\u2019t invent the computer or the mobile phone. And Google certainly didn\u2019t invent the search engine. They took an existing innovation \u2013 and made it better. So the pressure to innovate can be made more manageable if you think of it in terms of just being ready for it, as opposed to always needing to invent the innovation.\nIf you want to know where denial can land you, just take a look at what happened to the music industry, which panicked when music filesharing site Napster appeared on the scene. Music labels, fearing that they would lose control of how their product got to market, went to war with Napster. Digital music has survived regardless and is now the most common way we buy and listen to music.\nThe decline of the traditional music industry has another telling lesson. Your competitors might not be who you think they are. Apple built computers. Then in 2003, it launched its iTunes Store and by 2014 it had sold 35bn songs.\nAs Gareth Turpin, sales director at O2, pointed out when talking about customer expectations: \u201cIt isn\u2019t just our direct competitors that set our customers\u2019 expectations. They don\u2019t just look at our My O2 app and ask if it\u2019s as good as other operators\u2019. You get compared to every organisation they interact with. Our app might get compared to the Monzo app and customers will be asking, \u2018Why can\u2019t my phone company do what my bank does?\u2019\u201d\nIf you want to know how to improve your customers\u2019 experience, start mining your big data to understand why they make the decisions they do.\nBut to use big data successfully, you need to create a data culture with a strong governance model, the technology architecture to allow you to scale up as more data comes in, and teams with the right skills, including data scientists, data translators and data engineers.\n\u201cYou also need to democratise data access,\u201d Carlos Martinez Miguel, global director of big data and artificial intelligence business for O2 parent Telef\u00f3nica, told delegates. \u201cEnsure people have the data they need to provide customers with the right service.\u201d\n\u201cOver the years, the one constant has been change,\u201d O2\u2019s Bailey told delegates, so how ever you choose to face the future, one thing is key \u2013 don\u2019t stand still.\n\u201cTest and trial, learn and fail fast, and move on,\u201d said Brendan O\u2019Reilly, O2\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWhat we give to our customers has to be robust but the process of getting there has to be really fast.\u201d\nO2\u2019s Turpin agreed, warning businesses that there is no single silver bullet to future-proofing yourself. \u201cOther organisations are constantly innovating,\u201d he said. \u201cTo keep up, you have to stay relevant. Keep learning, evolving and innovating. Focus on the people who deliver the customer experience for you and never ever stop engaging them.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/trumps-legacy-drilled-public-lands-and-the-resulting-carbon-emissions": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/trumps-legacy-drilled-public-lands-and-the-resulting-carbon-emissions", "title": "Trump \u2018turns back the clock\u2019 by luring drilling companies to pristine lands", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 07:00:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>Energy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the administration \u2013 and the fossil fuels extracted could equal half a year of emissions from China<br></p><p>The Trump administration has offered oil companies a chunk of the American west that\u2019s four times the size of California \u2013 an expansive drilling plan that threatens to entrench the industry at the expense of other outdoor jobs, while locking in enough emissions to undermine global climate policy.</p><p>Energy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the unprecedented 461m acres put up for rent by the Trump administration, according to a new <a href=\"https://www.wilderness.org/sites/default/files/media/file/TWS_The%20Climate%20Report%202020_Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20Public%20Lands_new.pdf\">analysis</a> from the Wilderness Society.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/trumps-legacy-drilled-public-lands-and-the-resulting-carbon-emissions\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The Trump administration has offered oil companies a chunk of the American west that\u2019s four times the size of California \u2013 an expansive drilling plan that threatens to entrench the industry at the expense of other outdoor jobs, while locking in enough emissions to undermine global climate policy.\nEnergy companies have leased 9.9m acres from the unprecedented 461m acres put up for rent by the Trump administration, according to a new \n from the Wilderness Society.\nThe fossil fuels extracted from those leases could equal half a year of emissions from China, the world\u2019s top carbon polluter.\nThe administration has jump-started this plan, independent government analysts say, by offering energy leases at bargain rates. That has lured drilling companies to pristine lands where an outdoor economy had already grown up around wildlife and the natural landscape.\nTrump\u2019s Democratic opponents vow to close public lands to new drilling. But they probably can\u2019t stop the extraction that Trump has already started.\nDespite a glut in US oil supply, the federal government has proposed leasing places like the Slickrock Bike Trail in Moab, \n, where visitors pedal through petrified sand dunes and ancient seabeds.\nLocals have warned the potential air and water pollution aren\u2019t worth damaging this national treasure.\n\u201cIf we really get to the point that we need to burn the Picassos to heat the house for an hour, we could still do that, but there\u2019s no reason to lease these parcels now when they have a higher and better use,\u201d said Ashley Korenblat, CEO of Western Spirit Cycling and managing director of the not-for-profit group Public Land Solutions.\nThe leases are being signed as world scientists stress that pollution from oil, gas and coal needs to decline rapidly to avert catastrophe. Conservationists say the developed land will never again be wild and experts have repeatedly shown the sales aren\u2019t even earning a fair return for taxpayers, costing the federal government and states billions of dollars.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an era now where fundamental questions need to be raised about whether there should be more leasing or not. Millions of acres are already under lease that are not being developed,\u201d said David Hayes, the former deputy secretary of the interior department under President Barack Obama. \u201cSo why is the administration going so hard and fast over putting additional acreage up?\u201d\nJust as the Obama administration halted coal leasing on federal lands, Hayes argues the federal government should consider a moratorium for oil and gas. At the least, Trump officials should not allow drilling on frontier and sensitive areas, said Hayes, who is now the director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University School of Law.\nNearly all the Democrats running for presidentwould \n fossil fuel extraction on federal land.\nChase Huntley, energy and climate change director with the Wilderness Society, said the \u201ctremendous area\u201d the administration has offered to private companies and its disregard for the environment and climate \u201csuggests the administration\u2019s real interest here: which is advancing their agenda of energy dominance regardless of who it hurts\u201d.\nThe interior department and its Bureau of Land Management, which handles onshore leasing, did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the trade group for the US oil and gas industry, the American Petroleum Institute.\nMuch of the drilling on Trump-leased areas won\u2019t happen now, while global supply is high and oil and gas prices are so low that the acres wouldn\u2019t turn a large enough profit, but the Wilderness Society report shows that as a portion of the leases are acted upon they will be responsible for substantial pollution.\nOn the low end, the leases could result in emissions equal to the annual output of Brazil.\nPete Erickson, a senior scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute, reviewed the analysis and called the low-end estimates \u201cconservative\u201d.\nEarth is already \n than it was before humans began to burn fossil fuels for industry.\nTo keep the planet from climbing to 1.5C hotter, oil emissions would need to drop from 13 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year to less than 8 gigatons by 2030, according to an \n by the climate change news organization Carbon Brief. Gas emissions would need to decline from 8 gigatons to fewer than 5 gigatons.\nIn a report ordered by the Obama administration, the US Geological Survey in 2018 found that public lands account for \n and vegetation on the same lands absorbs 15% of the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide pollution.\nBut the Trump administration has largely refused to consider what its actions on public lands will mean for the climate crisis.\nLast month the White House proposed changes to how it applies a bedrock environment law \u2013 the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act. Under the \n, the government would no longer need to count climate impacts when approving infrastructure such as pipelines or leasing land for oil and gas drilling.\nThe administration has also made revisions to rules that protected the environment but proved inconvenient for the oil and gas industry.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything in the way of oil and gas leasing, it\u2019s going to be pushed aside,\u201d Hayes said, noting the reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Act, changes to an agreement for protecting sage grouse, the shrinking of national monuments in Utah and the opening of sensitive portions of the Arctic National wildlife refuge and National Petroleum reserve to development.\nIndependent analyses have found the US is not earning a fair amount from oil and gas leasing either.\nThe Congressional Budget Office in 2016 \n the federal government could increase its share of income from onshore leases by up to $1.2bn over 10 years. That figure would be about twice as large if it counted the money that would go to states. Audits by the Government Accountability Office have drawn similar conclusions that the government could demand more money.\nIf the government had raised royalty rates years ago, it could have earned up to $12bn more for taxpayers between 2009 and 2019, according to the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. States would have received about half that income.\n\u201cWe have policies that govern the way we lease our federal lands for oil and gas development that are a century old, and they just haven\u2019t kept pace. And we have others that haven\u2019t been looked at in decades. This has led to really a tremendous giveaway [to the oil and gas industry],\u201d said Autumn Hanna, vice-president of the non-partisan fiscal policy group Taxpayers for Common Sense. \nIn addition to expanding leasing opportunities, the Trump administration has opened lands that were once protected from industry. Last week the interior department finalized plans that allow mining, drilling and other development on lands recently removed from Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah.\nThe landscapes there feature \u201cclassic red rock canyons\u201d, \u201cforested mesas\u201d, and \u201cfantastical geologic features\u201d, ranging from standing rock pillars to streams that flash-flood several times a year, according to Steve Bloch, the conservation director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. The region has a dense concentration of prehistoric sites, where researchers are able to study the cultures of indigenous tribes.\nBloch said that doesn\u2019t matter to the federal government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the administration\u2019s approach to public lands, to their energy dominance agenda, that they believe the highest and best use of these places is for fossil fuel development,\u201d Bloch said.\nOf the 9.9m acres leased, 2.2m acres are in Wyoming and 1.3m acres are in Alaska. Nearly 5m acres are in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAdam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said \u201cat the broadest level, what we\u2019re witnessing is a sort of wholesale turnover of America\u2019s Arctic to the oil and gas industry\u201d.\nKolton said drilling on public lands was once done alongside arguments that the US needed to be energy independent, but the country is now a net exporter of oil. He believes the expansion of drilling, particularly in the Arctic, will be among Trump\u2019s most damaging and longest-lasting environmental legacies.\n\u201cRight now there\u2019s an attempt to not just roll back what was done under Obama in Alaska, but to turn back the clock half a century and look to an era where oil, mining and logging operations were unchecked,\u201d Kolton said. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/11/how-wework-went-from-modern-religion-to-calamity-wecrashed-podcast-adam-neumann": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/11/how-wework-went-from-modern-religion-to-calamity-wecrashed-podcast-adam-neumann", "title": "'He was a saviour figure': how WeWork went from modern religion to calamity", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:54:55 GMT", "summary": "<p>It had a god-like boss and beer on tap, but it was destined for disaster.

He\u2019s definitely evangelising to the crowd. And he\u2019s telling them: \u2018We can do anything together, if we can imagine.\u2019\u201d\nDavid Brown is recounting a story he once heard about the entrepreneur Adam Neumann, which shows him \u2013 with his picturebook Jesus looks and love of communal living \u2013 in messianic terms. Except that Neumann\u2019s church wasn\u2019t a church: in increasingly isolationist times, his idea was a workplace complete with buzzy startups and beer on tap. WeWork quickly became a hit, ubiquitous everywhere from New York to Nanjing, and seemingly unstoppable.\nThe astronomical rise of the co-working giant may have had a divine feel, but faith \u2013 let alone cash \u2013 couldn\u2019t save WeWork from the disasters that would beset it in 2019, as its value plummeted and investors \n in a bailout. As Brown\u2019s new podcast on Wondery, \n, explores, WeWork was a flawed business that played fast and loose with its employees\u2019 time and sanity long before a catastrophic attempt to go public laid its financial deficiencies bare. One former employee recalls the late-night meetings, some of which went on into the early hours of the morning; another remembers finding a boardroom trashed and smelling of weed, commandeered by the CEO. WeWork may have looked like the coolest company around, but on the inside it was a chaotic mess \u2013 and one that was haemorrhaging cash.\nBrown likens the collapse of WeWork to Enron, the infamous energy company that turned out to be an overblown, overvalued fraud. However, the journalist \u2013 who also presents the Wondery show Business Wars \u2013 doesn\u2019t see the parallels you might expect. Neumann\u2019s creation wasn\u2019t a scam, but a cautionary tale of what can happen when the word \u201cno\u201d is never off limits. \u201cThis is a story that\u2019s much bigger than just Adam Neumann,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a story about enablers. Calling him a huckster is far, far too simplistic. It doesn\u2019t put the credit where it really belongs \u2026 and that is with everyone.\u201d\nWeCrashed is about Neumann, then, but it is also about the collective greed, madness and hubris that led investors to pump billions into the business. The details Brown recounts in the series are astounding, \n (at a company where meat was banned for environmental reasons) to the creation of a WeWork primary school. But unlike other podcasts about companies gone bad \u2013 think Apple\u2019s \n, about Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s fake blood-testing company, Theranos, and the recent BBC hit \n \u2013 WeCrashed isn\u2019t a thriller. Rather, it is an even-handed, at times comic story that situates Neumann within a proto fake-news, post-recession era where tech success seemed infinitely possible and everyone was after the next \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2013 a privately held startup worth more than $1bn.\nIndeed, Brown recalls how Masayoshi Son \u2013 the CEO of the Japanese company, \n \u2013 \n. This made Neumann feel anointed, says Brown. \u201cThe \u2018unicorn picker\u2019 is giving him billions to exercise that craziness \u2013 it\u2019s a licence to take advantage of all this money that has been laid at your feet. A lot of people from the outside looking in will say, ex post facto, there was no way it was valued at what it was. In a sense it\u2019s true, but I still think it\u2019s too easy to let those folks who did make the big investment in it off the hook.\u201d\nBrown describes Neumann as a kid in a toy shop, but also a tragic figure, likening the situation to social media, where we \u201cattach ourselves to bigger ideas that make us look like we\u2019re more noble, and that we care about others. Before long, we\u2019ve created this perfect image of ourselves online. We start to believe in it, and other people start to reward us for it. [With Neumann], everyone got caught up in that frame of mind.\u201d Indeed, in trying to appeal to the \u201cwe\u201d, Neumann forgot that \u2013 especially in uncertain times for WeWork \u2013 society would very much judge the \u201cI\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/12/easyjet-ban-because-of-travel-agent-fraud": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/12/easyjet-ban-because-of-travel-agent-fraud", "title": "We were banned from easyJet because of our travel agent\u2019s fraud", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 07:00:27 GMT", "summary": "We had paid the agent but the airline said we owed \u00a3900<p><strong>In 2015 a group of us travelled to Prague on a trip booked through an independent travel agent, Thomas William Travel.

Almost three-quarters of adults in the generation that includes baby boomers born after the second world war own their own homes outright, up from just over half in 1993.\nAgainst a backdrop of rising generational divisions in modern Britain, the ONS linked \n with the boom in home ownership among older Britons, as well as a \n across the country.\nSince the launch of the scheme in 1979, which allowed social housing tenants to buy their homes at reduced prices, the proportion of council properties in Britain has slumped from 33.2% to only 17.6% in 2017.\nThe findings from the ONS come with potentially damaging implications for living standards for the current generation of adults under the age of 65, who are poised to enter retirement in worse financial health than their parents.\nAccording to research from the insurer Royal London, someone who owns their home outright could expect to maintain their living standards on a \n, while someone who rents privately would need almost double this, at about \u00a3445,000.\nThe ONS said that if the declining home ownership trend continued for the current generation of 35- to 44-year-olds, older people in future would be more likely to live in private rented accommodation than today.\nLindsay Judge, the principal research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the government should reform its regulations covering the private rented sector to make sure homes are fit for older people.\n\u201cThe prospect of renting privately in retirement will alarm many people as it could mean high costs, and low levels of housing security. It also carries huge cost implications for the state as the UK\u2019s housing benefit bill could escalate,\u201d she said.\nThe ONS found early signals to suggest the current trajectory could continue, including figures showing that 15.8% of 45- to 54-year-olds rent from private landlords, up from only 5.6% in 1997.\n, born between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, are expected to never own their own home, with many forced to live and raise families in insecure privately rented properties.\nHouse prices in some parts of the country have risen out of reach for young adults. \n, the average full-time worker could expect to pay about 7.8 times their annual earnings on purchasing a home, compared with about 3.5 in the early 1990s.\nKensington and Chelsea in London is the most unaffordable place in the country at \n. Copeland, in the north-west of England, is the most affordable at 2.5 times the average pay.\nRenting from a private landlord tends to be most common at younger ages but then gradually declines as people take out mortgages or receive an inheritance from family. However, the ONS said that people in every under-65 age bracket were now far more likely to rent privately than 10 or 20 years ago.\nPrivate rental could have some advantages for older people, including reduced maintenance responsibilities and costs at a time when people could find it harder to maintain their home.\nHowever, Nathan Long, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, a financial investment platform, said that many middle-aged private renters would face problems in the future.\n\u201cNot only were they born too late to benefit from final salary pensions, they were born too early to benefit from a lifetime of automatic pension saving and many won\u2019t be able to call on their house if times get tough,\u201d he said.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/10/should-i-sign-over-inherited-property-to-my-daughters": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/10/should-i-sign-over-inherited-property-to-my-daughters", "title": "Should I sign over inherited property to my daughters?", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 07:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>I\u2019m in doubt because one of them has a help to buy Isa and this may disqualify her as a first-time buyer</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I am in a dilemma as to what to do with an inherited property.

For our landlord with the \u00a3950 a month rental income, his after-tax profit in 2017 would have been \u00a32,520. From this April it will be \u00a31,080.\nThat leaves very little for repairs and maintenance and, if the tenant leaves and there is just one month\u2019s \u201cvoid\u201d in rental income, then the profit disappears altogether.\nBut it\u2019s not just interest deductibility that has changed. Landlords have, since 2016, been required to pay 3% additional stamp duty on purchases. On a \u00a3300,000 buy, the landlord now pays \u00a314,000 stamp duty, the normal buyer \u00a35,000.\nThen there\u2019s wear-and-tear allowances. Until 2016 landlords could routinely deduct 10% of net rent from their profits to cover wear and tear, whether they did anything on not. Now they can only claim tax relief when they actually purchase something for their rental property.\nCharging \n to tenants has also been banned, plus there\u2019s a new \n. No-fault \n are also on the way out.\nYou could almost shed a tear for landlords, the vast majority of whom are perfectly decent property managers and owners. The minority who are \u201crogue\u201d landlords are more than matched by the minority of rogue tenants. But the landlords who wail \u201cIt\u2019s my pension\u201d should show humility; their pension is just a transfer from young adults, many of whom are having to give across half their income to the landlord. What about their pension? What about their chances of ever getting on the property ladder?\nLandlords who bought during the boom years are sitting on large capital gains, the product of monetary policy, land scarcity and population growth, and virtually nothing to do with their own endeavours. The \u201cproblem\u201d I hear from some landlords is that they want to sell up, but will be hit with a large CGT bill. What a distressing situation to be in. Large unearned profits, on which they may have to pay some tax.\nWhat the buy-to-let episode shows is that policy matters. The explosion in buy-to-let was not a \u201cnatural\u201d phenomenon \u2013 it was a product of legal changes in the 1990s (the assured shorthold tenancy) married to a tax regime that favoured landlords. The result was entirely predictable; home ownership began to fall, not just among the young but increasingly among middle-aged people as well. \n wealth shifted into fewer and fewer hands.\nSince the change in buy-to-let taxation, the result has also been entirely predictable; the fall in home ownership has stabilised, and may be on the turn. There is a tendency to view the property market in fatalistic terms; there\u2019s nothing we can do about prices, building, demand and so on. But we can.\n"}}, "Science": {"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/12/moo-swings-cows-go-through-disruptive-puberty-too-study": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/12/moo-swings-cows-go-through-disruptive-puberty-too-study", "title": "Moo swings?

Scientists have found that dairy cows pass through a similar phase of emotional confusion that disturbs their otherwise rather stable personalities.\nThe findings emerged from extensive observations of Holstein dairy cattle as they matured from calves to adulthood. \u201cOur study identified a period of inconsistency in personality traits over puberty,\u201d said Nina Von Keyserlingk, a professor of animal welfare at the University of British Columbia in Canada. \nSome animals became more shy during puberty and others became more bold. Some became less interested in nosing up to new people or objects while others became more so.\nThe work sheds light on an under-studied realm of bovine life. Previous attempts to ascertain cattle personalities at different ages have found that they are reasonably stable in youth and in adulthood. Puberty, however, was something of a mystery.\nVon Keyserlingk and her former student Heather Neave assessed the cows for two personality traits by placing them in a test arena and watching how they behaved alone and around unfamiliar objects or strangers. The scientists ranked the animals first for boldness and second for how eager they were to explore. The tests were performed on calves at the ages of one and three months, one year and two and a half years.\nThe findings, reported in \n, suggest that while cows have stable personalities as calves and adults, in between those ages when puberty hits their behaviour becomes less predictable.\nScientists hope that understanding cattle personalities and how they might vary with age will help improve animal health and farming practices. Previous studies have found that cows that become more stressed tend to eat less, grow slower, have weaker immune systems and produce less milk.\n\u201cOur overall goal is to improve the lives of animals on farms,\u201d said Neave. \u201cIdeally, in the future, management practices would be tailored to the individual rather than the herd, so that all calves and cows have an opportunity to thrive on the farm and reach their full productive potential.\u201d\nLori Marino, a neuroscientist and executive director of the Utah-based Kimmela Center for Animal Advocacy, said she was not surprised by the findings, as puberty was \u201ca time of tremendous change both physically and emotionally\u201d.\nMarino, who co-authored a recent study, \n, added: \u201cIt is a time when humans, too, are quite volatile in their moods and personality traits. This finding again demonstrates how similar we all are, whether we are cows or primates.\n\u201cOf course, it makes pubescents less predictable and that can translate into how we interact with them. But in the end it tells us that if cows and humans share so much of their psychology with each other, we need to look at cows as beings who also have feelings about being farmed and having their children taken away from them in the dairy industry.\u201d \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/10/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smart-enough-for-mit": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/10/can-you-solve-it-are-you-smart-enough-for-mit", "title": "Can you solve it?

Instead, I got interested in the context: not why am I here, but how did I come to be here? Not why is there a universe, but how did it come to be? And those questions take you to the heart of physics.\nIt was the last experiment I ever did, and an unwitting experiment at that. I don\u2019t touch equipment. I\u2019m a theorist through and through: pens, paper, pencils, computers. Even when I was in college, I somehow managed to slip through the requirement that students had to take a laboratory course. I found a way of getting out of it. No doubt, the exploding oven was looming in the background.\nThere are questions that have right and wrong answers as opposed to opinions, and we\u2019ve unfortunately come to a place where many people don\u2019t make that distinction. It\u2019s a vital one, especially when some of the questions are going to determine the fate of humankind and the fate of the planet. The solution has to be education. We need to impress upon kids at an early age that there are ways of investigating the world that can yield demonstrable truths. That\u2019s an exciting thing for a kid to learn. And it\u2019s essential.\nChina is the likely place for it to be built, but it has to be a group of countries coming together. I\u2019d like to think it doesn\u2019t matter in which country it\u2019s built, because it\u2019ll be a machine for all humanity. Science is this beautiful place, perhaps the sole place, where the world comes together to work shoulder-to-shoulder on questions that transcend national borders, and that\u2019s a powerful thing. Is there a fifth force? Are there other particles? Is there an explanation for why matter particles have the properties they do? In other words, is there an explanation for why reality has the properties that it does? These are the kinds of universal questions the next machine can help us answer.\nI would go forwards instead of backwards, which is a good thing because I don\u2019t think you can go backwards and I know for a fact that you can go forwards. Hanging out near the edge of a black hole is a popular technique. You spend a year near the edge and if you are close enough, you come back and it will be a billion years later. Or you go out on a rocket ship near the speed of light for six months, and turn around and come back, and depending on how close to the speed of light you travelled, when you return it\u2019ll be thousands or millions or billions of years into the future. So we know how to time travel in theory, we just don\u2019t know how to execute it in practice. I would go as far forward as the device allowed me to, because once I got there, I could always read about what happened beforehand. I would want to be in an era when there are still planets and stars. I would probably not go beyond a trillion years from now. It would be very lonely though. I would only do it if I could take my family.\nThis is absolutely fundamental. The beauty of the second law of thermodynamics is that while it stipulates that the overall amount of disorder has to increase, little pockets of order can form so long as, in the process, they create enough disorder in the surrounding environment to compensate. For stars and planets, we can establish that the formation process discards enough waste and disorder to the surrounding environment that the overall disorder goes up. Indeed, we humans are contraptions that squeeze out the disorder that is locked inside of matter. We eat things, we breathe, and when we metabolise all that we take in, we use it to create our internal order, to grow bigger, stronger and so forth, but in the process we release enough heat and waste so that the overall disorder balance sheet is totally in the direction of disorder.\nThe nature of time. Where did time come from? Is there a realm of reality where there isn\u2019t any notion of time? Is time fundamental or does it only emerge in certain environments? These are the kinds of questions that, were we to gain insight before I move on to whatever realm awaits, which is probably nothing, would be deeply satisfying.\nThese days in Manhattan, on the clearest of nights, you can see about three stars. It may sound naive, but it feels to me that if more people nightly experienced a brilliant sky full of stars, in some small way it would make the world a better place. It would make the world a place where we\u2019d recognise we\u2019re part of a much grander whole. We are heading in a direction where fewer and fewer members of the species will have that experience.\nThere\u2019s a tendency, certainly among some scientists I know, to judge religion by whether or not it gives us factual information about an objective reality. That\u2019s not the right yardstick. There are many others who recognise that the value of religion is found in its capacity to provide a sense of community, to allow us to see our lives within a larger context, to connect us through ritual to our forebears, to alleviate anxiety in the face of mortality, among other thoroughly subjective benefits. When I\u2019m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.\nMy dad was a composer and a singer. He dropped out of school early on to travel around the country as a singer-songwriter and later on as a vocal coach. That was a deep part of my upbringing. Music to me is the most direct route that we humans have to touching something that is powerfully beyond everyday experience. It allows the mind to move into a realm that\u2019s hard to get to, hard to reach, by any other means.\nI don\u2019t worry in the sense of it giving me some kind of existential angst. I am confident that I am not a Boltzmann brain. However, we want our theories to similarly concur that we are not Boltzmann brains, but so far it has proved surprisingly difficult for them to do so. So, I see Boltzmann brains as a mathematical problem that we need to solve, as opposed to an existential affront. I believe it is a problem that we will one day overcome.\nAs I discuss in the book, we have emerged from a vast sequence of quantum events stretching back to the big bang, every one of which could have turned out differently, resulting in a universe in which we did not exist. When you realise that, and when you realise too that life and mind are fleeting phenomena on the cosmic timeline, you realise that we should strive not in the service of leaving a lasting legacy, but rather because we have each been given an astoundingly unlikely, profoundly precious opportunity.\nThat there is great value in understanding how we fit into the largest possible landscape, the longest possible timeline. Seeing how we and our species fit in between the big bang and the closest science can take us to the end of time is something that gives us deeply illuminating context. It allows us to see the human search for meaning and purpose in a different light, and with that to recognise that there is no ultimate answer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, the context provided by the cosmological narrative frees us fully to develop our own, deeply and thoroughly subjective reasons for being.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/09/starwatch-the-double-cluster-a-secret-in-the-deep-sky": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/09/starwatch-the-double-cluster-a-secret-in-the-deep-sky", "title": "Starwatch: the Double Cluster, a secret in the deep sky", "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2020 21:30:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>To find these distant objects you need to get well away from the city lights and give your eyes time to adjust</p><p>This week\u2019s challenge is for northern hemisphere observers to see a pair of faint star clusters.

By the end of 2021, its orbit will have an inclination of 17\u00b0 \u2013 high enough to take images of the sun\u2019s extremities \u2013 and if the mission is extended it could reach an inclination of 33\u00b0.\nComputational models and magnetic field measurements suggest that the sun\u2019s poles could be dominated by huge coronal holes \u2013 areas of the surface that are less dense than their surroundings and will show up as ominous dark pools.\n\u201cThese coronal holes are enormous at the poles. We\u2019ll be able to peer over the edges \u2026 and see how it grows and shrinks with solar activity\u201d, said Nicola Fox, director of Nasa\u2019s heliophysics division. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve never been able to do before.\u201d\nStriking geometric features are also a possibility, according to McCaughrean. The first images of Jupiter\u2019s north pole surprised astronomers with an \n of storms twirling like cogs around a central vortex, while Saturn\u2019s north pole features a \n.\nThe $1.3bn mission will run parallel to \n, launched 18 months ago, which has flown closer to the sun than any spacecraft, and the \n, which has acquired the highest resolution images of the solar surface since it began observations in December. \nAt just 3.83 million miles from the solar surface \u2013 technically inside the sun\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 Parker will be seven times closer to the Sun than Solar Orbiter. But, McCaughrean points out, Parker will not be taking any direct images because if it looked at the sun, it would melt. From its slightly less scorching vantage point, Solar Orbiter will be able to make long-range observations of surface features such as sun spots as well as detecting the solar wind streaming past.\n\u201cWe always wanted to make this seeing and feeling connection. The stuff that you can see at the surface you can feel going past a few days later\u201d, said McCaughrean. \u201cParker is out there going \u2018Ooh, I\u2019m feeling stuff but I\u2019ve got no idea where it came from\u2019.\u201d\nSolar Orbiter\u2019s camera and other instruments are housed behind a heat shield, peering out through shuttered peepholes that close whenever the probe\u2019s interior gets too hot. The titanium shield is coated in a substance called SolarBlack, made from charred animal bones, something Esa concluded was uniquely well-suited to keeping the craft at a stable temperature throughout the mission.\nThe probe\u2019s orbit, which at times will move almost in synch with the sun\u2019s own rotation, will allow it to track sun spots on the solar surface as they appear and vanish, and will investigate the origins of the solar wind as it streams off the sun.\nThe mission will also use helioseismology \u2013 measurements of small and large scale oscillations at the sun\u2019s surface \u2013 to try and unravel the sun\u2019s internal structure. The sun\u2019s acoustic \u201cringing\u201d can also reveal sun spots bubbling up from the interior days before they appear as darkened patches on the surface.\nSolar Orbiter is scheduled to begin making science measurements in May, with full operations starting in November 2021, when the probe\u2019s telescopes switch on.\n\u201cIt will capture the imagination like science fiction does and inspire the next generation of scientists and space explorers,\u201d said Yannis Zouganelis, Esa\u2019s deputy project scientist for Solar Orbiter.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-infections-symptoms-transmission-wuhan-china-cruise-ship-quarantine-cases-latest-update-news": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/12/coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-infections-symptoms-transmission-wuhan-china-cruise-ship-quarantine-cases-latest-update-news", "title": "Coronavirus: Cruise ship turned away from five countries allowed to dock in Cambodia \u2013 latest news", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:18:52 GMT", "summary": "<p>MS Westerdam, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, will dock on Thursday as WHO chief warns coronavirus threat is greater than terrorism</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/f1-chinese-gp-set-to-be-called-off-due-to-coronavirus-with-vietnam-race-at-risk\">F1\u2019s Chinese GP called off due to coronavirus</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who\">WHO chief says threat of virus is greater than terrorism</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/uk-man-linked-several-coronavirus-cases-speaks-hospital-steve-walsh\">Worthing hospital healthcare worker contracts coronavirus</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Share your stories</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T15:11:49.262Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>The cruise operator Carnival has warned its shareholders that the coronavirus outbreak will have a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on its financial results this year.</p><p>The firm owns MS Westerdam luxury cruise ship which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">finally being allowed to dock in Cambodia after being turned away by five countries despite having no sick passengers</a>. </p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T14:53:32.550Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>More than 100 people have been tested for coronavirus so far in Scotland \u2013 but no one has yet been diagnosed with the disease.</p><p>There have been 106 negative tests north of the border, according to figures released by the Scottish government.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.\nNew and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\nThe virus causes \n. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\nChina\u2019s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outside \n, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.\nThe number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. \nOne of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle.\nWe don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about \n each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\nAnother key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\nAnyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last two weeks and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath should stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild, the \n.\n experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has \n of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.\nHealthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/12/health-inequality-greater-than-previously-thought-report-finds": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/12/health-inequality-greater-than-previously-thought-report-finds", "title": "Health inequality greater than previously thought, report finds", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:01:28 GMT", "summary": "<p>In the poorest areas women are getting their first long-term illness at just 47 and men at 49 </p><p>Women are living nearly ten years longer in poor health than previous estimates, while men are living an extra seven years, according to a report based on <a href=\"https://appg-longevity.org/events-publications\">new NHS data</a> launched by the health secretary on Wednesday.</p><p>The new analysis means that men on average are being diagnosed with their first significant long-term condition at 56 and women at 55.

In 2035 there will be around 16 million cases of dementia, arthritis, type 2 diabetes and cancers in people aged 65 and over \u2013 twice as many as in 2015.

When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.\u201d\nHe thanked friends, family and colleagues for their support and asked the media to respect their privacy.\nWalsh spoke as the World Health Organization called for people not to face blame where the virus had transferred from them to others. Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director at WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said it was \u201cdeeply, deeply unhelpful\u201d to single out sufferers as culpable in some fashion.\nHe told a press conference on Tuesday: \u201cI really wish we could refrain from personalising these issues down to individuals who spread disease.\u201d\nWhen asked about Walsh, Ryan said it was important to learn from individual cases, but that \n had not changed.\n\u201cThis is by no means, compared to other events, a massive \u2018super-spreading\u2019 event. This is an unusual event and it is a wake-up call because there may be other circumstances in which this disease can spread like this, so we need to study those circumstances for sure but it doesn\u2019t change our overall assessment.\n\u201cPeople are not at fault \u2013 they are never at fault in this situation, so let\u2019s be extremely careful here, it\u2019s really, really important that we don\u2019t attach unnecessary stigma to this.\u201d\nWalsh is thought to be \n \u2013 someone who transmits infections to far more people than the majority do. He was transferred to St Thomas\u2019 hospital from Brighton on Thursday.\nThe company he works for, Servomex, said: \u201cWe are very pleased that Steve Walsh has made a full recovery. We continue to provide support to him and his family. We are working with public health authorities to ensure the welfare of our staff and communities and wish anyone with the virus a quick and full recovery.\u201d\nWalsh\u2019s statement came as it emerged a second GP surgery in Brighton had shut after the outbreak of coronavirus in the city.\nOn Monday, \n because of an \u201curgent operational health and safety reason\u201d, after a member of staff contracted the virus.\nOn Tuesday morning, it emerged that a second branch of the same practice, less than two miles away, had also closed.\nA sign fixed to the door of the Deneway branch read: \u201cThe surgery is closed due to organisational health and safety reasons. Please contact 111 if you need to speak to a health professional.\u201d\nPHE said it was working to identify healthcare staff and patients who had been in contact with the two infected healthcare workers, as well as people who had close and sustained contact with other people confirmed to have the virus.\nPHE has been contacting passengers who sat near Walsh during his journey home on 28 January, on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to Gatwick.\nThe Brighton Evening Argus reported on Tuesday that two nurses at a local hospital were being quarantined after treating a new patient suspected of contracting the coronavirus. The paper said the patient was understood to have recently arrived from Hong Kong.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/intel-and-vivo-latest-to-cancel-mwc-plans-over-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/intel-and-vivo-latest-to-cancel-mwc-plans-over-coronavirus", "title": "Intel and Vivo latest to cancel MWC plans over coronavirus", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:37:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Barcelona event to go ahead with measures including \u2018no handshake policy\u2019 for global attendees<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-live-updates-china-goes-back-to-work-as-cases-exceed-40000-latest-news\">Coronavirus - live updates</a></li></ul><p>Spanish and Catalan authorities have insisted the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona will go ahead later this month despite some of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms pulling out because of coronavirus fears.</p><p>The MWC \u2013 which is billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest exhibition for the mobile industry\u201d and which attracts around 100,000 visitors from almost 200 countries \u2013 looks set to be significantly affected by the spread of the virus.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/intel-and-vivo-latest-to-cancel-mwc-plans-over-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Spanish and Catalan authorities have insisted the \n (MWC) in Barcelona will go ahead later this month despite some of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms pulling out because of coronavirus fears.\nThe MWC \u2013 which is billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest exhibition for the mobile industry\u201d and which attracts around 100,000 visitors from almost 200 countries \u2013 looks set to be significantly affected by the spread of the virus.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook, Cisco Systems, US chipmaker Intel and Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo became the latest firms to cancel, citing health and safety concerns.\nEricsson, Amazon, Sony and LG have also abandoned plans to attend the congress, due to be held from 24-27 February.\nChina\u2019s top smartphone manufacturer, Huawei, and its smaller rival ZTE, are still set to attend and have said their executives and staff will undergo a self-imposed two-week quarantine period before appearing at the show.\nZTE has also said its stand and equipment would be disinfected daily, with all of its booth exhibition staff brought in from countries outside of China, mainly Europe.\nIn a \n, GSMA \u2013 which organises the congress \u2013 said the coronavirus had \u201ccreated disruption, in particular for exhibitors and attendees from around the world, including the 5-6,000 (5-6%) who have historically attended from China\u201d.\nIt offered its sympathy to all those affected but said the congress would go ahead as planned.\nHowever, GSMA said no travellers from Hubei province would be allowed to attend the event, while all travellers who had been in China would need to prove they have been out of the country for 14 days before the congress started.\nAttendees will have their temperatures taken and will also have to self-certify that they have not been in contact with any infected people.\nAn \u201cincreased cleaning and disinfection programme\u201d will be implemented in catering areas, toilets and public touch-screens, and on surfaces and handrails.\nOther measures include a \u201cno-handshake policy\u201d for all those attending, a \u201cmicrophone disinfecting\u201d protocol for all speakers, and the distribution of sanitising and disinfection products.\n \u2013 one in Mallorca and another on the remote Canary island of La Gomera.\nSpain\u2019s finance minister, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, said Spain\u2019s health system was \u201cabsolutely prepared to respond to any contingency\u201d, adding that both the people infected with the coronavirus were asymptomatic but remained in isolation.\n\u201cOver the last few hours, we\u2019ve learned that some multinationals have decided not to come to our country to attend an important technology event as a precautionary measure for their workers,\u201d she said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe want to send out a message of confidence and trust.

He is thought to have infected at least 11 people while traveling and socialising, before developing (mild) symptoms himself. It\u2019s hard not to read the media emphasis on his role as a scout leader as an implication that he has carelessly endangered innocent children.\n\u201cSuper-spreader\u201d is the buzzword of the day, and it is freighted with moral connotation. It sounds like anyone with that label has been recklessly putting it about. The term refers to someone who infects significantly more others than the average person who contracts the illness. That\u2019s a necessarily vague definition, because being a super-spreader doesn\u2019t in itself impute any specific behaviour, condition, or degree of contagiousness.\nThere are many reasons why a disease may be transmitted from some infected individuals more than from others. Perhaps they simply come into contact with more people, for example because of their job or through travel. In other cases it\u2019s a question of poorly understood biology: a virus may be present in higher levels in some people, or they might remain asymptomatic or infectious for longer. It\u2019s true that certain behaviours, like coughing and sneezing in crowded public places, can exacerbate the risk of spreading, although there\u2019s no clear evidence that \n help much, at least for coronavirus. And if you don\u2019t (yet) have any symptoms, you have no obvious reason to take special precautions.\nGiven all this, there\u2019s no reason to attach any culpability to people identified as super-spreaders. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d says Nathalie MacDermott, a paediatrician and clinical researcher at King\u2019s College London. But such appeals have the entire history of disease and medicine weighing against them.\n\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d is one of the most notorious cases of blame and ostracism. An Irish cook working in the United States, Mary Mallon was an symptom-free carrier of the salmonella bacterium responsible for typhoid, who spent many years in enforced quarantine, the longest spell from 1915 until her death in 1938 \u2013 an extreme distortion of the word coined from the 40 days (Italian \n) of isolation imposed on plague victims in the Middle Ages.\nThe stigmatising of leprosy is now idiomatic, but that made such attitudes no less virulent during the emergence of Aids in the 1980s. There were \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of HIV too, and the impulse to pass moral judgement was never stronger. Even after it became clear (in the face of much ideological denial) that Aids was not exclusively a condition afflicting gay men, individuals who seemed to be hubs of the contagion network could be denounced for their sexual promiscuity.\nThe coronavirus outbreak shows that we haven\u2019t moved far beyond that culture of blame. \u201cSo who are likely to be the people spreading the disease?\u201d \n. \u201cHere, we profile the 10 most likely culprits.\u201d Among them are apparently \u201chair-flickers\u201d (beware of young students!) and \u201clazy cleaners\u201d. This Victorian view of cleanliness as moral virtue is exacerbated by careless language from specialists. \u201cImagine someone particularly lackadaisical who spreads the virus across everyone and every object,\u201d one virologist has said. \u201cThey can be a super-spreader.\u201d\nAnd of course so (we think) can a suspicious \u201cforeigner\u201d, as even British-born Chinese people \n. This too is an age-old story of xenophobia, long predating the Telegraph headline from the 1980s warning of \u201cAfrican Aids \u2018deadly threat to Britain\u2019\u201d. The very notion of contagion spreading by \u201cgerms\u201d, first developed in the late 19th century by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, passed the blame from location \u2013 the presence of \u201cbad air\u201d (miasma) \u2013 to people, especially those \u201cinvading\u201d and bringing exotic disease from beyond our borders just as germs invade the body.\nThis is a delicate balance. After all, epidemiology does show that \u201csuper-spreading\u201d can have a crucial impact in the early stages of an epidemic. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily implicate individuals. Sylvie Briand, director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the World \n Organization, has said that \u201cWe need to talk about super-spreading events and not people.\u201d As is so often the case in medicine, however, experts, the public and media alike need also to reflect on how history and language condition our thinking.\n Philip Ball is a science writer\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows", "title": "Signs of cancer can appear long before diagnosis, study shows", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:20:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>Research into genetic mutations suggests possibility of tests that would detect cancer earlier</p><p>Early signs of cancer can appear years or even decades before diagnosis, according to the most comprehensive investigation to date of the genetic mutations that cause healthy cells to turn malignant.</p><p>The findings, based on samples from more than 2,500 tumours and 38 cancer types, reveal a longer-than-expected window of opportunity in which patients could potentially be tested and treated at the earliest stages of the disease.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/signs-of-cancer-can-appear-long-before-diagnosis-study-shows\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Early signs of cancer can appear years or even decades before diagnosis, according to the most comprehensive investigation to date of the genetic mutations that cause healthy cells to turn malignant.\nThe findings, based on samples from more than 2,500 tumours and 38 cancer types, reveal a longer-than-expected window of opportunity in which patients could potentially be tested and treated at the earliest stages of the disease.\nThe work was carried out as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project, the most comprehensive study of cancer genetics to date.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s extraordinary is how some of the genetic changes appear to have occurred many years before diagnosis, long before any other signs that a cancer may develop, and perhaps even in apparently normal tissue,\u201d said Clemency Jolly, a co-author of the research based at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n\u201cUnlocking these patterns means it should now be possible to develop new diagnostic tests that pick up signs of cancer much earlier,\u201d said Peter Van Loo, co-lead author, also of the Crick Institute. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity.\u201d\nThe discovery that the seeds of cancer are often sown many years before the first symptoms arise will not change cancer screening in the immediate term. But it points to the possibility that those at risk could be spotted far earlier.\nThe study revealed that about half of the earliest mutations occurred in just nine genes, meaning there is a relatively small pool of common genes that serve as triggers for cells to diverge from healthy development to a path towards cancer. It might be possible, in future, to pick up such mutations using so-called liquid biopsies \u2013 genetic tests that detect mutations in free-floating DNA carried in the blood that can indicate the presence of tumours elsewhere in the body.\n\u201cOne could try and identify these [early mutations] and do some kind of very sensitive imaging on patients that were positive,\u201d said Van Loo. \u201cOr even further into the future, one could conceive of methods that really targeted these cells and made them light up in an imaging approach or just kill them in one go. That\u2019s a bit science fiction at the moment.\u201d\nAbout 363,000 new cancer cases are reported in the UK every year, according to Cancer Research UK, with the disease causing 165,000 deaths annually.\nThe team analysed and sequenced nearly 2,700 whole genomes of cancer samples and mapped mutations in 38 different types of tumours.\nWhile human cells undergo billions of mutations, only a small number of them, called driver mutations, give rise to cancer. The researchers looked at how many times a single change, or driver mutation, had been replicated and copied across chromosomes.\nUsing what they describe as a \u201ccarbon-dating method\u201d, they were able to reconstruct the order in which the genomes of cancer cells started to accumulate errors and eventually carry large segments that had been scrambled or copied. The team found that these mutations occurred \u201cparticularly early\u201d in ovarian cancer as well as in two types of brain tumour, glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.\nThe analysis is published in \n as part of a wider collection of 22 papers from the Pan-Cancer project.\nPrevious research on cancer genetics has focused on the so-called coding regions of the genome, which contain the instructions for cells to make proteins.\nLincoln Stein, of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Canada, who is also a member of the Pan-Cancer project steering committee, said: \u201cThe vast majority of work so far has been on the protein coding portion of the genome. That\u2019s a mere 1%. It\u2019s like trying to put together a 100,000-piece jigsaw puzzle when you\u2019re missing 99% of the pieces and there\u2019s no puzzle box with a completed picture to guide you.\u201d\nThe latest research provides some of the first detailed insights into the role of the other 99% of our DNA \u2013 the genome\u2019s \u201cdark matter\u201d \u2013 and how these less-studied regions contribute to cancer. The study identifies several important genes that lie outside the coding region. Stein said these newly identified genes would increase the proportion of patients for whom a cancer-causing mutation could be pinpointed from about two-thirds to 95%.\n\u201cPrior to that, we would be in the dark about roughly one-third of patients that came into the clinic,\u201d Stein added.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-anxiety-we-live-in-frightening-times": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-anxiety-we-live-in-frightening-times", "title": "The Guardian view on climate anxiety: we live in frightening times | Editorial", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 18:25:41 GMT", "summary": "When psychologists warn that global heating could cause trauma to become normalised, world leaders should take notice<p>\u201cIt makes sense\u201d is the first thing to say about the phenomenon being described by psychologists as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/10/overwhelming-and-terrifying-impact-of-climate-crisis-on-mental-health\" title=\"\">climate anxiety</a>.

While it makes sense to be worried about the climate emergency, becoming overwhelmed is counterproductive. The sound advice from psychologists that actions, however small, can help to alleviate feelings of distress and powerlessness echoes the experiences of activists including \n that \u201cthe minute you start doing something, the depression goes away\u201d.\nNot all low moods are readily lifted, however, and warnings of worsening mental health as a result of climate disruptions and hardships should be taken seriously. Already there is cause for concern, with research showing that people who have experienced extreme weather such as floods in the UK are 50% more likely to suffer from problems including \n. Resilience may be a desirable quality, but is much more easily developed by those who are cushioned by income or advantage.\nGrowing demand for psychological support should be met by professionals who are able to distinguish everyday worries from post-traumatic stress or other symptoms. Disasters on the scale of Australia\u2019s recent bush fires and \n can be expected to produce severe mental as well as physical reactions, particularly in children and other vulnerable groups. In some parts of the world, trauma is already normalised, and when psychologists \n that it could become ubiquitous, policymakers everywhere should take notice.\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that there are reasons to hope, as well as despair. As the environmental scientist \n said last year, \u201cWe [humans] are stupid, we are negligent, we are tardy. But on the other hand, we are adaptable, we are smart and even as things are falling apart, we are trying to stitch them together\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/real-problem-netflix-addiction-arbon-emissions": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/real-problem-netflix-addiction-arbon-emissions", "title": "The real problem with your Netflix addiction?

Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren came up with plans that would restructure farm policy to direct funding away from subsidizing production and toward conservation. Warren would increase funding 15-fold for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), to $45bn. The CSP pays farmers for regenerative agriculture practices \u2013 planting soil-saving cover crops, reducing chemical use and tillage, and all the while sequestering carbon in the soil.\nExport markets for American ag commodities are falling apart. The world has been telling us through markets for years that we are growing about 30% too much corn and soy. Meanwhile, we are killing the Gulf of Mexico with excessive commercial fertilizer, which washes down the Mississippi River. California and Australia burn in part because we are spewing too much nitrogen \u2013 as problematic as CO2 for global warming \u2013 from our broken agrichemical system.\nIncreasing numbers of midwestern farmers who watched their fields wash away in last spring\u2019s scouring torrents are showing up at field days offered by the Practical Farmers of Iowa, which preaches the gospel of making money on the farm by saving soil and reducing chemical costs. They watch the weather closer than anyone, and they\u2019re ready to look into the old way of doing things \u2013 grazing in rotation with a diverse series of carbon-capturing crops \u2013 to find a way forward.\nCandidates started to explore the topic at a rural forum organized in Storm Lake last March by the Iowa Farmers Union. The discussion intensified during the summer as a loose coalition of Iowans, led by the former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, pushed candidates to pay farmers for environmental services instead of insuring them for planting in a flood plain.\nBernie Sanders is all-in with the Green New Deal. Joe Biden, advised by Vilsack, came up with his own comprehensive plan. Buttigieg is now conversant in how microbial activity in the soil can reverse nitrogen loss to air and surface water.\nCandidates embraced the idea that renewable energy \u2013 wind, solar, hydrogen \u2013 can not only ameliorate the climate crisis but also create high-paying technical jobs in rural communities hemorrhaging people.\nYou wouldn\u2019t know it by the non-stop coverage of the percentage fractions separating the leading Democratic campaigns, or whether Sanders insulted Warren, or how Senator Susan Collins equivocated again after lunch. But, as the Amazon shrinks, our quiet revolution in agriculture policy might be the most important story of the news cycle.\nMarkets are telling us they don\u2019t need all that corn. Iowa State University tests of the kernel tell us that soil degradation is eroding protein content. Wheat production in China is falling because of it. General Mills is up on the news, and is urging growers in the Dakotas to go organic because consumers demand it. Kellogg is phasing out glyphosate from its acres. The latest poison from Bayer, dicamba, faces a new wave of class-action lawsuits from angry farmers.\nIn other words, the gig is up on the last 50 years of chemical- and export-driven food production. It hasn\u2019t worked for farmers or rural communities, and they know it.\nThat\u2019s the message from the fallow fields of Iowa covered in snow, and in a few places winter rye holding soil together and nitrogen in its place. There would be a lot more of it if the government would catch on and quit rigging everything for the agrichemical supply chain.\nThe ball is rolling because farmers know Nature is calling the shots. Eventually politics catches up. Climate was a priority for Iowans in this cycle, unlike before. The conversation has changed, and not a moment too soon.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/if-china-valued-free-speech-there-would-be-no-coronavirus-crisis": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/if-china-valued-free-speech-there-would-be-no-coronavirus-crisis", "title": "If China valued free speech, there would be no coronavirus crisis", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 12:50:34 GMT", "summary": "<p>Country could have contained spread of disease if only it had learned lessons from Sars outbreak </p><p>The death of the whistleblower Chinese doctor Li Wenliang has aroused strong emotions across China.

Social media is awash with posts mourning \n but was taken into a police station instead for \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d and \u201cdisrupting social order\u201d.\nGrief quickly turned into angry demands for free speech. The trending topic \u201cwe want freedom of speech\u201d, which attracted millions of views, and links to Do You Hear the People Sing, a song popularised in recent Hong Kong protests, were quickly censored by police.\nIn an unusual move, the Communist party\u2019s powerful internal discipline enforcement agency swiftly announced it would dispatch investigators to Wuhan to look into \u201cquestions raised by the masses\u201d associated with Li. The Chinese authorities are starkly aware that anger and raw emotions could easily boil over and spill on to the streets.\nAs in the past when health or safety scandals broke, it is likely the Chinese government will fire a few local officials to douse public anger. But this will only be an expedient measure that will not resolve the real problem \u2013 its citizens\u2019 lack of a right to free speech.\nWe might remember a similar health crisis 17 years ago when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, which also originated from \n, infected more than 8,000 and killed about 800 across 17 countries. In 2003 the authorities covered up the disease for months before another whistleblowing doctor, 72-year-old Jiang Yanyong, exposed the crisis. More recently Jiang, now 88, has had his contacts with the outside world cut off and movements restricted after he asked the authorities last year to reassess the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement. He is now confined to his home by the authorities.\nUnfortunately, China does not appear to have learned lessons from the Sars epidemic.\nDespite the flourishing of social media, information is more tightly controlled in China than ever. In 2013, an internal Communist party edict known as Document No 9 ordered cadres to tackle seven supposedly subversive influences on society. These included western-inspired notions of press freedom, \u201cuniversal values\u201d of human rights, civil rights and civic participation. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership.\nCompared with 17 years ago, Chinese citizens enjoy even fewer rights of speech and expression. A few days after 34-year-old Li posted a note in his medical school alumni social media group on 30 December, stating that seven workers from a local live-animal market had been diagnosed with an illness similar to Sars and were quarantined in his hospital, he was summoned by police. He was made to sign a humiliating statement saying he understood if he \u201cstayed stubborn and failed to repent and continue illegal activities, (he) will be disciplined by the law\u201d.\nChina\u2019s GDP per capita might have grown nearly eight times from 2003 but its citizens have not enjoyed more freedom and rights, which many predicted would come with rising economic achievements.\nIf Li had lived in a society where citizens could speak freely without fear of being punished for exposing problems the authorities would rather not see, and if his warning had been heeded and action swiftly taken, the virus could have been contained. Instead, it has already killed at least 724 and infected nearly 35,000 people, and the virus is still spreading.\nUnless Chinese citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and other basic rights are respected, such crises will only happen again. With a more globalised world, the magnitude may become even greater \u2013 the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak is already comparable to the total Sars death toll.\nHuman rights in China may appear to have little to do with the rest of the world but as we have seen in this crisis, disaster could occur when China thwarts the freedoms of its citizens. Surely it is time the international community takes this issue more seriously.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/climate-fire-leaders-disaster-australian-government", "title": "This is the age of the megafire \u2013 and it\u2019s being fuelled by our leaders | Tim Flannery", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:00:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>In the face of the climate disaster it helped create, the Australian government has given us only lies and denial</p><p>Unprecedented wildfires have recently devastated California, the Amazon, southern Europe, Siberia and Australia.

As I write, fires continue to burn around Canberra, and though rain has begun to fall in northern New South Wales, 17 are \u201cyet to be contained\u201d according to the \n. Meanwhile, what is traditionally the worst part of the fire season for Victoria and South Australia is just commencing. Conditions have been so severe that firefighters have often been unable to stop fires joining up, generating massive dry thunderstorms that spread fire with thousands of lightning strikes.\nSo far the fires have burned an area around the size of England, killed \n and destroyed about \n. They have left deep psychological scars, and while it seems impossible to shift the \n, the fires will alter the way that Australians view themselves and their country.\nThere\u2019s a British saying that fire is a good servant but a bad master. But in Australia, with its unique vegetation and climate, fire can also be a terrifying predator. Like all good predators, it remains hidden until it\u2019s ready to strike, so even in this fire-plagued year, most Australians have not seen the flames that lurk in the forest, taking life seemingly at random. But many have smelt its stench. Sometimes we wake at night to thickening smoke, and lie there wondering where the beast is prowling. Some mornings we peer out the window and decide that it is not a safe day to be outside.\nThis year fire struck Australia when its guard was down, trapping tens of thousands of people while they were enjoying their summer vacations. The sight of Australians disembarking from warships on naval regulation gangways reminded us that, in this new Australia, the fiery beast that lurks in the forest can make anyone a temporary climate refugee.\nIncreasingly, Australian fire harasses its victims for weeks or months before striking. You prepare for its onslaught, only for the flames to turn aside at the last moment. You prepare the buckets, hoses and other equipment again and again, while fire weakens you with its smoke and debilitating heat. It can also trap you, as if you\u2019re a mouse in a corner. You wait, with fire all around, and all exits cut, your fate in the hands of the wind. If you are lucky enough to survive, you can remain trapped for weeks as you wait for roads to be cleared and made safe.\nWhen the predator finally does pounce, it does so with extraordinary fickleness. One house is left standing, while all around are smouldering ashes; one fire truck is picked up by a fire tornado and overturned, while nearby no wind is felt. Why me, both the fortunate and unfortunate ask?\nThe psychological impact of such experiences is profound. I\u2019ve lost a house to bushfire, and successfully defended another. When I look into the eyes of the fire-hunted, I see the same expression I\u2019ve seen in the eyes of returned soldiers or traumatised refugees. Bushfire triggers a primeval fear, one that has been plaguing our ancestors since the first ape was plucked from its family, carried away and consumed by a big cat.\nFew things matter as much to Australians as their homes and communities. More than \n have been destroyed so far by the fires. And even when those affected do have insurance, history shows that \n. The fires will doubtless also spark new regulations, which will make rebuilding more expensive.\nSome people now face the prospect of leaving or remaining homeless in stricken regional economies. All of us are less resilient to future shock \u2013 and future shocks there will be. Natural climate variation might have brought a year as hot as 2019 to Australia \n, but greenhouse gas pollution has increased that frequency to one in eight. And every day the coalfires burn in Australia and elsewhere, we\u2019re shortening those odds \u2013 adding to the severity of the fires of tomorrow.\nRight now, many Australians are simply exhausted. They have been deprived of their summer vacations and beset by debilitating smoke. And as the immediate trauma slowly fades, other impacts will emerge. \nare already reporting health effects from inhalation of bushfire smoke, and over the longer term more and more consequences will be felt. Some medical researchers fear that the consequences of smoke exposure from this year\u2019s fires will be felt for generations.\nAny credible response to such a massive national catastrophe needs to be proportionate to the danger. Instead the government response has been risible. It wants to plant more trees to capture carbon, but also wants more coal burned and more forest cleared, so there will be less to catch fire when the next big fire comes. Its previous climate denialism has been revealed as a catastrophic error, but it remains paralysed in the face of a disaster it helped create.\nIf Australia was being threatened by an external enemy, Scott Morrison\u2019s government would be doing everything within its power to recruit allies. It would put the economy on a war footing, and raise arms. But when it comes to climate-fuelled catastrophes, it claims that there\u2019s nothing it can do: Australians have to remain among the world\u2019s worst greenhouse gas polluters, and keep spoiling international efforts to address the problem. To do otherwise, the government says, would be \u201ceconomy wrecking\u201d. But guess what? There is a solution \u2013 burn more fossil fuels, especially gas. To an increasing number of Australians these lies are nauseating. The words of our prime minister sound like the words of a traitor. \nWhat does one do when immense evil is occurring in one\u2019s country? As far as swift climate action is concerned, all good choices have gone up in smoke, and only difficult, divisive options remain. Australians marched against the Vietnam war, and prevailed. But they also protested against the horrific treatment of asylum seekers, and so far have failed. Now we shall see how communities, businesses and politicians respond to this crisis in \u201cthe lucky country\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low", "title": "When it comes to climate hypocrisy, Canada's leaders have reached a new low | Bill McKibben", "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2020 10:30:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>A territory that has 0.5% of the Earth\u2019s population plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget<br></p><p>Americans elected Donald Trump, who insisted climate change was a hoax \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that since taking office he\u2019s been all-in for the fossil fuel industry.

They know \u2013 yet they can\u2019t bring themselves to act on the knowledge. Now that \n cause for despair.\nThe Teck mine would be the biggest tar sands mine yet: 113 square miles of petroleum mining, located just 16 miles from the border of Wood Buffalo national park. A federal panel \n the mine despite conceding that it would likely be harmful to the environment and to the land culture of Indigenous people. These giant tar sands mines (easily visible on Google Earth) are already among the biggest scars humans have ever carved on the planet\u2019s surface. But Canadian authorities ruled that the mine was nonetheless in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d.\nHere\u2019s how Justin Trudeau, recently re-elected as Canada\u2019s prime minister, \n in a speech to cheering Texas oilmen a couple of years ago: \u201cNo country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there.\u201d That is to say, Canada, which is 0.5% of the planet\u2019s population, plans to use up nearly a third of the planet\u2019s remaining carbon budget. Ottawa hides all this behind a \n about \u201cnet-zero emissions by 2050\u201d and so on, but they are empty promises. In the here-and-now they can\u2019t rein themselves in. There\u2019s oil in the ground and it must come out.\nThis is painfully hard to watch because it comes as the planet has supposedly reached a turning point. A series of remarkable young people (including Canadians such as Autumn Peltier) have captured the imagination of people around the world; scientists have issued ever sterner warnings; and the images of climate destruction show up in every newspaper. Canadians \n the Australian blazes on television; they should bring back memories of the devastating forest fires that forced the \n, in the heart of the tar sands complex, less than four years ago.\nThe only rational response would be to immediately stop the expansion of new fossil fuel projects. It\u2019s true that we can\u2019t get off oil and gas immediately; for the moment, oil wells continue to pump. But the Teck Frontier proposal is predicated on the idea that we\u2019ll still need vast quantities of oil in 2066, when Greta Thunberg is about to hit retirement age. If an alcoholic assured you he was taking his condition very seriously, but also laying in a 40-year store of bourbon, you\u2019d be entitled to doubt his sincerity, or at least to note his confusion. \n has addled the Canadian ability to do basic math: more does not equal less, and 2066 is not any time soon. An emergency means you act now.\nIn fairness, Canada has company here. For every territory making a sincere effort to kick fossil fuels (California, Scotland) there are other capitals just as paralyzed as Ottawa. Australia\u2019s fires creep ever closer to the seat of government in Canberra, yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, can\u2019t seem to imagine any future for his nation other than mining more coal. Australia and Canada are both rich nations, their people highly educated, but they seem unable to control the zombie momentum of fossil fuels.\nThere\u2019s obviously something hideous about watching the Trumps and the Putins of the world gleefully shred our future.

In other words, POCO is a four digit number, and MUCHO is a five digit number. \nCan you work out which letter stands for which digit so that the sum makes sense?\n POCO is 4595 and MUCHO is 68925\nFor fifteen letter Os to add up to a number ending in the letter O, then O is either 0 (zero) or 5. Let\u2019s say that O is 0 (zero). In this case, fifteen Cs must be CH. The only digits that fit are C = 1 and H = 5. The number MU, therefore, is 15 x P, which means that U must be an 0 (zero) or a 5. But both of those numbers are already taken by the letter O and H. So we can eliminate the case that O is 0, and deduce that O = 5.\nIf O = 5, the carry into the tens column is 7, since 5 x 15 = 75.\nWe can eliminate some of the candidates for C. To start, C cannot be 1, since then 15 x C + 7 = 22, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundred\u2019s column, which would mean that the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 1.\nWe can also eliminate values from 2 to 8 for C, shown here for completeness:\nIf C = 2, then 15 x C + 7 = 37, which means there is a carry of 3 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 8. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 2.\nIf C = 3, then 15 x C + 7 = 52, which means there is a carry of 5 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 0. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 3.\nIf C = 4, then 15 x C + 7 = 67, which means there is a carry of 6 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 1. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 4.\nIf C = 5, then 15 x C + 7 = 82, which means there is a carry of 8 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 3. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 5.\nIf C = 6, then 15 x C + 7 = 97, which means there is a carry of 9 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 4. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 6.\nIf C = 7, then 15 x C + 7 = 112, which means there is a carry of 1 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 6. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 7.\nIf C = 8, then 15 x C + 7 = 127, which means there is a carry of 2 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which would mean the C in MUCHO would be 7. C cannot have two values so we eliminate C = 8.\nSo C must be 9. If C = 9, then 15 x C + 7 = 142, which means there is a carry of 4 to the hundreds\u2019s column, which means the C in MUCHO is also a 9.\nIf C = 9, H = 2, and the thousands column has a carry of 7 + 1 = 8. In other words 15P + 8 = MU. P must be between 1 and 6, since MU is less than 100. We have as candidates 1, 3, 4, 6. We can eliminate 1, since this makes MU 23, and 2 is taken. We can eliminate 3, since this makes MU 53 and 5 is taken. We can eliminate 6 because this makes MU 98 and 9 is taken. So P = 4, M= 6 and U = 8.\nGracias!\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/29/see-the-most-detailed-images-ever-taken-of-the-sun-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/29/see-the-most-detailed-images-ever-taken-of-the-sun-video", "title": "See the most detailed images ever taken of the sun \u2013 video", "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 22:38:57 GMT", "summary": "<p>New images taken by the Inouye solar telescope in Hawaii show the sun's surface in unprecedented detail thanks to its 30km resolution - more than twice that of other solar observatories&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/29/solar-telescope-captures-most-detailed-pictures-yet-the-sun\">Telescope captures most detailed pictures yet of the sun</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/29/see-the-most-detailed-images-ever-taken-of-the-sun-video\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/13/first-living-robots-xenobots-designed-on-supercomputer-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/13/first-living-robots-xenobots-designed-on-supercomputer-video", "title": "First 'living robots' designed on supercomputer \u2013 video", "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 20:00:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>Tiny 'xenobots' made up of living cells have been created by teams of scientists at the University of Vermont and Tufts University using a supercomputer to design them.</p><p>The millimetre-wide bots could move toward a target and automatically repair themselves and researchers hope they will&nbsp; help clear human arteries, clean microplastics from the oceans and find radioactive waste</p><p><br></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/13/first-living-robots-xenobots-designed-on-supercomputer-video\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/08/cuttlefish-given-3d-glasses-to-determine-how-they-judge-distance-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/08/cuttlefish-given-3d-glasses-to-determine-how-they-judge-distance-video", "title": "Cuttlefish given 3D glasses to determine how they judge distance \u2013 video", "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2020 19:16:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>A team of researchers have strapped a pair of 3D glasses to an unsuspecting cuttlefish and set it loose in an underwater movie theatre to work out how the marine molluscs know how far away their prey is before launching an explosive, tentacled attack</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2020/jan/08/cuttlefish-given-3d-glasses-to-determine-how-they-judge-distance-video\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/dec/26/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-seen-on-boxing-day-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/dec/26/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-seen-on-boxing-day-video", "title": "'Ring of fire' solar eclipse seen on Boxing Day \u2013 video", "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2019 16:21:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>People gathered across parts of Asia and the Middle East to watch a rare annular&nbsp;solar&nbsp;eclipse, also known as a ring of fire.

Both have cameras with hybrid optical zoom of 3x and digital zoom to 30x.\nThe super-sized Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 6.9in screen and a quad camera system on the back. The two standout features are a 108MP main camera and a 10x hybrid optical zoom lens that has a periscopic arrangement, using a prism to direct light sideways into the body of the phone, similar to that used by \n last year for a 5x zoom. The camera is then capable of up to 100x digital zoom, twice that managed by rivals.\nBen Wood, the chief of research for CCS Insight, said Samsung had \u201cdefinitely stepped up when it comes to camera capabilities on the new S20 line-up\u201d, but in some areas the South Korean firm was \u201cmerely in catch-up mode with some of its Chinese rivals who have been using stacked periscope zoom modules for a while\u201d.\nWood said Samsung\u2019s innovations concerning the handling of extended zoom, such as the new window-in-window viewfinder with over 30x magnification, were worthwhile additions.\nAll three models have new Amoled screens with a refresh rate of 120Hz \u2013 twice the speed of standard smartphone screens and faster than the 90Hz screens used by OnePlus and Google last year \u2013 which makes use of the device smoother in scrolling and other fast-moving interactions.\nFrom the front the devices resemble refined versions of \n from 2019, with an all-screen display on the front, a new central pinhole selfie camera at the top and curved glass at the sides. The backs are all glass with a big camera lump in the top left corner resembling that recently used by \n and \n.\nWhile the S20 will be available in 4G or 5G versions, the S20+ and S20 Ultra will only be available with 5G. All three models come with at least 128GB of storage and a microSD card slot for adding more, 8, 12 or 16GB of RAM, fast cable and wireless charging, large batteries and ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanners for unlocking the devices.\n\u201cThe challenge, which Samsung faces together with all other smartphone makers, is how to stand out from the endless stream of similar-looking black touchscreen rectangles,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe support for 5G across all three variants of the S20 lineup is a key element, ensuring customers are getting a futureproof purchase and the camera certainly stands out, particularly on the flagship S20 Ultra.\u201d\nAlongside the S20 series, Samsung is also launching a clamshell phone with a foldable display, called the \n, and an updated version of its wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds+, which have a similar design but increased battery life of 11 hours of playback and a charging case.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/intel-and-vivo-latest-to-cancel-mwc-plans-over-coronavirus": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/11/intel-and-vivo-latest-to-cancel-mwc-plans-over-coronavirus", "title": "Intel and Vivo latest to cancel MWC plans over coronavirus", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:37:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Barcelona event to go ahead with measures including \u2018no handshake policy\u2019 for global attendees<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-live-updates-china-goes-back-to-work-as-cases-exceed-40000-latest-news\">Coronavirus -

They say there is clear evidence this is already being done by companies and organisations that have bought data from the DHSC, having identified individuals whose medical histories are of particular interest.\nConcerns that the data is not truly \u201canonymous\u201d have been raised by senior NHS officials, who believe the public are not being told the full truth. But the DHSC insists it only sells on information after thorough measures have been taken to ensure the complete anonymity and confidentiality of patients\u2019 personal information.\nIn December, \nthat the government had raised \u00a310m in 2018 by granting licences to commercial and academic organisations across the world that wanted access to so-called anonymised data. If patients do not want their data to be used for research they have to actively \u201copt out\u201d of the system at their GP surgery.\nAccess to NHS data is increasingly sought by researchers and global drugs companies because it is one of the largest and most centralised public organisations of its kind in the world, with unique data resources.\nWashington has already made clear it wants unrestricted access to Britain\u2019s 55 million health records \u2013 estimated to have a total value of \u00a310bn a year \u2013 as part of any post-Brexit trade agreement. Leaked details of meetings between US and UK trade officials late last year showed that the acquisition of as much UK medical data as possible is a top priority for the US drugs industry.\nNow the DHSC and the agencies responsible for handling and selling data are increasingly under pressure to tighten up controls, to protect patient privacy and prevent information being misused.\nAsked if it was right to say that the patient data was anonymous, as claimed, Professor Eerke Boiten, director of the Cyber Technology Institute at De Montfort University in Leicester, said: \u201cThe answer is no, it is not anonymous.\n\u201cIf it is rich medical data about individuals then the richer that data is, the easier it is for people who are experts to reconstruct it and re-identify individuals.\u201d\nBoiten believes more thought should be given to controlling and limiting the sale of data to prevent it potentially being sold on by the initial purchaser to companies with huge information stores and global reach. \u201cIf Google, for instance, were to use this data and end up finding a cure for cancer, and then sold the cure back to the NHS for huge sums of money, then I think we could say we had missed a trick,\u201d he said.\nThe NHS has previously faced claims that medical data from millions of patients has been \n.\nPhil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said the public was being betrayed by claims that the information could not be linked back to individuals. \u201cRemoving or obscuring a few obvious identifiers, like someone\u2019s name or NHS number from the data, doesn\u2019t make their medical history anonymous,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the unique combination of medical events that makes individuals\u2019 health data so ripe for exploitation is precisely what makes it so identifiable. Your medical record is like a fingerprint of your whole life.\n\u201cPatients must know how their data is used, and by who. Alleging their data is anonymous when it isn\u2019t, then selling it to drugs and tech companies \u2013 or, through intermediaries, to heaven knows who \u2013 is a gross betrayal of trust. People who are rightly concerned about such guile and lack of respect have every right to opt out, if they want their and their family\u2019s medical information kept confidential and for their own care.\u201d\nLicences to buy data are issued by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), part of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A spokesman said any information sold had been \u201canonymised in accordance with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) anonymisation code of practice\u201d.\nUntil early December, the CPRD said on its website the data it made available for research was \u201canonymous\u201d but, following the \n story, it changed the wording to say that the data from GPs and hospitals had been \u201canonymised\u201d \u2013 meaning only that some measures had been taken to de-identify it.\nBooth added: \u201cFollowing the ICO\u2019s code of practice does not mean that data is necessarily anonymous. The law now recognises that one of the most common methods of \u2018anonymisation\u2019 \u2013 the use of pseudonyms to obscure some bits of information \u2013 means that data is still identifiable. Indeed, the information commissioner herself says it must be considered personal data.\u201d\nA spokesman for the MHRA said the wording on the website had changed \u2013 but only to be consistent: \u201cWe have replaced the word \u2018anonymous\u2019 with \u2018anonymised\u2019 to be in line with the ICO terminology \u2018anonymised,\u2019 which is the term we use throughout our website. We have done this to be consistent and to avoid any confusion.\u201d\nInformation disclosed by some of CPRD\u2019s customers clearly suggests they can link the information back to individual patient records via their GP surgeries. The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program in the US, which uses DHSC data, says \n: \u201cAnonymized information from the CPRD on demographics, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and prescriptions dispensed is available to [our] researchers. Validation of diagnoses, reports of diagnostic tests and anonymized notes from hospitalizations and referrals can be obtained from the general practitioner upon request.\u201d\nIf the data were truly anonymous it would be impossible to retrieve an individual patient\u2019s medical notes.Neil Bhatia, a GP who is Information Governance Lead and data protection 0fficer in Hampshire, said: \u201cTruly anonymous data \u2013 utterly incapable of being traced back to an individual \u2013 is very hard to achieve, given that there is so much information about us in the public domain and held by companies such as Facebookand Google, because so much of our personal data is out there thanks to the massive data breaches over the last few years. In fact, it\u2019s almost impossible for record-level data (where each line of the dataset corresponds to an individual) to be made truly anonymous.\u201d\n This article was amended on 11 February 2020 to include a response from the MHRA that was received after the initial publication deadline.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/how-millions-use-youtube-tutorials-to-perfect-their-trade": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/how-millions-use-youtube-tutorials-to-perfect-their-trade", "title": "How millions use YouTube tutorials to perfect their trade", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:00:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>From bike mechanics to baking, the video-sharing site offers a goldmine of knowledge</p><p>Holding an Allen key in a grease-stained hand, Jo\u00e3o Cruz looks every bit the professional bike mechanic.

Wind back five years, however, and this 39-year-old former journalist barely knew how to fix a brake cable.\n\u201cTo be a good mechanic, you need tools and knowledge; I had the tools, but I needed to get the knowledge,\u201d said Cruz, owner of \n, a small bike rental business in the Portuguese city of Porto.\nIn response, he spent the best part of a year trawling \n for tutorials on bicycle maintenance. Even today, he still regularly logs onto the video-sharing website for \u201ctips and tricks\u201d when faced with knotty technical problems.\nCruz is not alone. Around the world, a growing cadre of entrepreneurs are turning to video tutorials posted on YouTube to help them learn their chosen trade.\nAnother example is Holly Winter, a copywriter-turned-professional-dressmaker from Farnborough in Hampshire. The self-taught designer and seamstress treats YouTube much like a personal instructor, using it to train up in everything from boning corsets to fixing her sewing machine.\n\u201cWhenever I encounter something that I haven\u2019t done before or if I need to brush up on some skills, then there is always a YouTube tutorial for it,\u201d she says.\nAs well as the sheer breadth of topics covered on the platform, the fact the information is free and readily available keeps her coming back. The appeal becomes especially clear when compared with the time and expense of traditional, in-person training options, she adds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only me working the job, so if I have to spend a day or more on a course, then there\u2019s no one else making wedding dresses. I mean, my brides aren\u2019t going to put their weddings on hold for me.\u201d\nThe obvious upside of learning a trade face-to-face is the ability to asks questions in the moment. But what happens once the course is over? The advantage of YouTube, Winter counters, is the ability to post questions and receive responses long after the tutorial has been delivered and uploaded.\nChinelo Awa shares this sentiment. Owner of \n, a bespoke London-based cake decorating venture, she has found most YouTube experts to be \u201csurprisingly responsive\u201d. Her go-to YouTubers include \n (AKA the Topless Baker), \n and \n, all of whom clock up tens of thousands of views for their instructional videos.\n\u201cIf you put a question in the comments, then they usually come back to you \u2026 but if you go on a day-course and have follow-up questions, you might not be able to ask the teachers,\u201d says Awa, who works part-time as a paralegal.\nOf course, not everything on YouTube is quality information \u2013 and not all its contributors are diligent at responding. Nor does the video-sharing platform offer the immediacy of interaction that some social media platforms do. Compared to Instagram\u2019s \u201clive\u201d service, for example, which Awa uses to take real-time classes with professional bakers like \n, YouTube can feel a little static.\nThat said, Awa still rates it as a safe space to perfect her trade: \u201cIf someone has thousands of followers on YouTube, it\u2019s easy to think that your questions can be stupid, but my experience is that people are happy to help.\u201d\nTai Alegbe agrees. Learning a completely new skillset can feel intimidating, says the co-founder of \n, a financial technology start-up. So, the ability to kick off at the beginning and advance at his own pace takes the initial sting out of the learning process.\nIn his case, the challenge at hand was to get up to speed with basic coding. His initial fears were eased after seeing that most of the coders on YouTube weren\u2019t tech geniuses, but \u201cnormal people\u201d. As he notes: \u201cGoing online and understanding that these experts are just like you really helps\u201d.\nYouTube, which is owned by Google, likes to promote its service as a practical tool for learning and not just a repository of teen vlogs and funny cat videos. According to the company\u2019s own statistics, nine in 10 users worldwide perceive its platform as a \u201cplace to learn\u201d. To drum home the point, it now boasts a dedicated \u201c\n\u201d channel for education-oriented uploads.\n\u201cYouTube opens us a world of learning that may not be otherwise accessible, whether it is supplemental education, professional and everyday skills or even how-to tutorials and life hacks\u201d, says Katie Kurtz, the company\u2019s head of learning partnerships.\nIndependent research appears to give credence to the claim. \n by the Pew Research Centre found that \u201chow-to\u201d videos are what bring 51% of all US-based YouTube users to the site.\nLikewise, in New Zealand, \n on YouTube see the site as a place to \u201caccess knowledge and learn new careers skills\u201d. In Australia, meanwhile, a similar proportion (54%) prefer to \n rather than read a user manual or talk to someone on the phone.\nCharles Lomu in western Sydney fits that bill. A former high-school dropout, he describes how he used YouTube to commercialise his \u201cside hustle\u201d in barbering: \u201cI was doing haircuts until the early morning, but I never looked at it as a profession because I\u2019d never been to barber school. And then I turned to YouTube.\u201d\nToday, Lomu, who now runs his own barber shop, is using his skills to teach barbering to disengaged students at the local high school. Predictably, he has loaded up a series of \n about the course.\nFor young people who have grown up using YouTube to help with their homework or teach themselves how to play the guitar, turning to it to learn a trade marks a natural step. Such was the case for Andy Smith, a 31-year-old economics graduate, who recently founded \n, an e-commerce service for plastic-free products.\nRealising he would have to teach himself some rudimentary programming, his immediate instinct was to search online for video tutorials. Learning a trade via YouTube isn\u2019t without its flaws, Smith says. First, there\u2019s the issue of quality control. \nSecondly, the task-specific nature of many instruction videos can lead to a piecemeal or patchy understanding. Smith\u2019s programming skills, for example, are still by no means \u201cin depth\u201d. That said, he feels he knows enough now to give clear instructions to any future contractors.\n\u201cHas YouTube made me into a Jack of all trades?\u201d he ponders. \u201cPerhaps. If anything, in fact, it\u2019s probably made me into a Jack of too many trades.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/08/tories-concern-huawei-uk-5g-network-iain-duncan-smith": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/08/tories-concern-huawei-uk-5g-network-iain-duncan-smith", "title": "Tories express concern over Huawei role in UK 5G network", "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2020 10:32:39 GMT", "summary": "<p>Letter from Iain Duncan Smith and other MPs requests that \u2018high-risk\u2019 vendors are ruled out</p><p>A group of senior Conservatives have written to their fellow Tory MPs expressing concern over the government\u2019s decision to allow Chinese technology company Huawei to have a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network.</p><p>Iain Duncan Smith, who is among the signatories, said there was cross-party concern about the issue.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/08/tories-concern-huawei-uk-5g-network-iain-duncan-smith\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "A group of senior \n have written to their fellow Tory MPs expressing concern over the government\u2019s decision to allow Chinese technology company Huawei to have a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network.\n, who is among the signatories, said there was cross-party concern about the issue.\nThe letter, which was also signed by former ministers including Owen Paterson, David Davis and Damian Green, said some MPs were working to find a better solution to the \n issue.

It will also introduce a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring the Chinese company\u2019s share of the 5G market cannot exceed 35% and can be reduced over time.\nIn response, Duncan Smith said: \u201cI think therefore we need to get the government to look to get the involvement of Huawei not to 35% but to 0%.\u201d\nHe said there was a lot of disquiet over the government plans. \u201cThere is real concern across the floor of the house,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got no friends out there any longer on this issue.

On 5 January 2019 starting at 6.27pm, I read the apocalypse-thriller Severance by Ling Ma for 31 minutes and 40 seconds. Starting at 2.12pm on 3 November 2018, I read mermaid romance tale The Pisces by Melissa Broder for 20 minutes and 24 seconds.\nAnd \n knows more than just what books I\u2019ve read and when \u2013 it also knows which parts of them I liked the most. On 21 May 2019 I highlighted an excerpt from the third installment of the diary of Ana\u00efs Nin, the data shows, and on 23 August 2018 at 11.25 pm, I highlighted an excerpt from Leslie Jamison\u2019s The Recovering: Intoxication and its Aftermath. On 27 August 2018, I changed the color of a highlighted portion of that same book.\nOther habits tracked included the times I copied excerpts from books into my iPhone\u2019s clipboard and how often I looked up definitions of words in Kindle\u2019s attached dictionary.\nI already understood Amazon tracks our purchases on its site, \n across the web, \n, our \n and \n. But the extensive tracking of my reading habits \u2013 my most beloved and previously offline hobby \u2013 was jarring. Who is this information shared with, what is done with it, and how can it affect my privacy \u2013 and the future of the reading experience itself?\nAmazon\nsays it does not share what individual customers have highlighted with publishers or anyone else, a spokeswoman said. The highlights are logged to sync reading progress and actions across devices, she said. Aggregated data is used to show which parts of books have most frequently been highlighted, as Kindle customers can see while reading. It does say the data is used \u201cto provide customers with products and services, pay content providers and improve the reading and shopping experience\u201d, the spokeswoman said.\nFrom my reading history, which included books on self-help and mental health, Amazon could easily make inferences about my personal health, career and hobbies. Even the time of day I read or the speed at which I turn pages can provide insights on personal traits, said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.\n\u201cIt is hard for us to wrap our minds around what artificial intelligence enables Amazon to do with this data,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kinds of nuanced correlations Amazon is able to find through analyzing that data is beyond what we can conceptualize as human beings.\u201d\nThough Amazon says it is not currently sharing the insights gleaned from reading habits with anyone else, that the company holds on to the data shows it could be used in the future, said Alastair Mactaggart, an advocate who co-wrote the ballot measure behind the \n Consumer Privacy Act.\n\u201cMany of these companies just scoop up as much data as they can without knowing how it will be used \u2013 all they know is that more information is better,\u201d he said. \u201cThe essential truth is that these entities know us better than we know ourselves.\u201d\nActivists and hackers claim this information is not, in fact, necessary for the apps to function. \u201cThere is no reason Amazon or any other company needs to collect that kind of information to provide you with the service, which is simply reading a book,\u201d said Evan Greer, the director at privacy activist group Fight for the Future.\nTo limit the amount of data Amazon \n on them, a number of readers are bypassing Amazon\u2019s approved file formats and downloading pirated books to Kindle. The so-called Kindle hackers have found ways to modify book covers, change brightness and \n within ebooks.\nWhile more tech-savvy users can attempt to alter the Kindle device or app to prevent tracking, the average reader can do little to escape Amazon\u2019s reach. The company is now responsible \n of some 50% of physical books for major publishers and 80% of ebooks. For those who prefer to purchase books from brick-and-mortar stores, tracking reading on book social site Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, will put you back into the tech giant\u2019s purview.\n\u201cIdeally if we thought data collection practices were unfair, we could go somewhere else,\u201d Greer said. \u201cBut that there is little choice speaks back to the fact that decisions Amazon makes have such an enormous effect across sectors because of its size and the monopoly that it exercises.\u201d\nCould Amazon\u2019s monopoly over the publishing industry change the nature of books themselves?

While EU rules cap roaming fees outside Europe at \u20ac50, the legislation does not apply to satellite networks on planes and boats, which charge premium rates for data, wanted or not, unless customers actively switch off data roaming.\nSome ferry passengers have been hit when their mobiles connected to the onboard system, even when sailing within the European Union, where data charges must not exceed tariffs customers pay at home.\nEmma Hamilton\u2019s monthly bill from \n almost doubled after a return ferry trip to Ireland, even though she never left EU waters.\n\u201cMy phone activated a rest-of-the-world 24-hour pass, apparently an obscure bolt-on that kicks in when you go outside Europe,\u201d she says. \u201cI reminded the call centre that Ireland and the UK are in Europe but was told it applied anyway.\u201d\nO2 told the \n that customers should turn off data roaming before boarding ferries to prevent them connecting to onboard satellite services.\nAs pressure grows on airlines and ferry operators to provide internet services, an increasing number of passengers face being caught out \u2013 without even touching their phone \u2013 by premium rates set and billed by their home service provider. These can be over \u00a310 per MB, the amount required to browse one web page. They can kick in if a passenger simply takes a single photo.\nExtortionate charges can also stack up if a boat or plane passes close to national borders. \n are configured to pick up the strongest signal and if that happens to come from a country outside the EU, international roaming charges will kick in.\nHaines\u2019s phone signal was automatically relayed from aircraft antenna via satellite to a ground network operated by AeroMobile. The Crawley-based company, a subsidiary of Panasonic Avionics, began offering inflight services in 2008 and 23 airlines have signed up. Airborne users are not automatically sent text messages by their provider detailing charges. Moreover, cabin crew on the Virgin Atlantic flight made no mention of potential charges if passengers fail to heed advice to switch to flight mode. The airline, which offers the service on half of its fleet, acknowledged that while onboard announcements warn of international roaming charges when using AeroMobile, they do not say that those who don\u2019t use it can also be liable. It declined to state the cut it received from the charges.\nHaines\u2019s bill was levied by her company\u2019s service provider, Intercity Technology, which sells phones and services to businesses and uses the \n network.\nIntercity confirmed its inflight service connects automatically, even if the phone is stowed in the overhead locker. It says: \u201cIt\u2019s included in customers\u2019 monthly bill as an over- charge for roaming in a country not covered by their selected tariff.\u201d It insists it alerts customers to unusual charges and, if necessary, suspends data to protect their interests.\nHaines claims she never received an alert. \u201cThe first I knew about it was when my data was cut off when I arrived at Barbados,\u201d she says. \u201cI assumed there had been fraudulent activity. It was only later that Intercity informed me of the reason.\u201d\nIntercity has offered to contribute \u00a3500 towards her bill as a goodwill gesture. It also promised to remind all customers to switch to flight mode.\nAeroMobile says it advises airline clients to announce that roaming charges apply on board. \u201cThe passenger will receive a text from the onboard system telling them they are connected to the mobile service. However, it is their home operator that must communicate the cost.\u201d\nIntercity didn\u2019t respond to requests for its satellite roaming charges. Vodafone, its network provider, charges up to \u00a37.20 per MB of data for airline connections, compared with \u00a36 by Three. BT\u2019s charge is \u00a39.20. All include this in their data roaming and spend cap, so customers have their data cut off after the bill reaches \u00a335, unless they have asked for it to be lifted. EE requires customers to buy an add-on at \u00a336 a day for 5MB. Virgin Mobile says its customers can\u2019t connect to satellite services.\nThe charges can confuse customer service staff as well as customers. When Ali Hines was billed for downloading \u00a343 of data from a Norwegian network while flying home from Indonesia, she was told by O2 that her phone must have picked up a superior signal over the border. Hines pointed out she was 10,000km from Norway at the time of the download and was then told, like Haines, she had inadvertently connected to AeroMobile.\nShe insists her phone was switched off, whereupon O2 reckoned it must have connected while boarding or leaving the aircraft, although the download was three hours after takeoff. \u201cThey\u2019ve since refunded the charge, but there\u2019s nothing to stop this from happening again,\u201d she says.\nO2 confirmed the phone had connected to AeroMobile, which uses a Norwegian mast, and that she should have received a text alert. Its satellite roaming charges are \u00a37.50 per MB.\n\u201cWe are sorry Ms Hines was given incorrect information and have credited \u00a351 to her account,\u201d it says.\nGay Haines, who is still left owing \u00a3600, plans to escalate her complaint to the Communications Ombudsman. \u201cI cannot believe I am the only idiot who forgot to turn their phone to flight,\u201d she said.\n The EU has banned mobile phone providers charging extra fees for users to use their allowance of minutes, texts or (most) data within EU territory. Take care if you are near a border as phones connect to the strongest signal, which could be in a non-EU country.\n Think twice before turning your data-roaming cap off. Providers have to cut you off when you\u2019ve used \u20ac50 under EU rules, unless you ask them to lift the cap. If you do, you risk unlimited bills.\n In the air or at sea, your mobile could connect to a network in a non-EU country or an onboard satellite system on your ship or a nearby ship, in which case EU rules won\u2019t apply. Switch your device into flight mode to avoid this.\n Complain to a dispute resolution scheme. If you feel you were unfairly charged and can\u2019t resolve the issue with your provider, you can take your complaint to the Communications Ombudsman or adjudicator Cisas.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/17/best-smartphone-2019-iphone-oneplus-samsung-and-huawei-compared-and-ranked", "title": "Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked", "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 07:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our updated list of the top iOS and Android mobile phones \u2013 at the best prices right now</p><p>Need a new smartphone but don\u2019t know which one is the very best?

We speak to four self-employed workers who say smart technology has made all the difference \u2026\n\u201cI\u2019d been using [Amazon Echo\u2019s voice assistant Alexa] at home for a while when I realised it would make a great addition to the workplace too. To start with, it was primarily used as a radio, but over time I started using it for other tasks \u2013 we use it all the time now. My job responsibilities include handling social media, content creation, writing and PR, so my days can be jam-packed, and I use Echo like a super-efficient additional employee who acts as PA and researcher. Day-to-day, we sync it with our office\u2019s online calendar, so we never forget a call and get reminders about meetings. Reminders on your PC are easy to miss \u2013 if you have lots of tabs open or you\u2019re away from your desk, for example, but audio reminders are harder to ignore. Personally, I find the time-tracking skill helpful too, because I sometimes struggle with time management. We\u2019ve set it so we receive flash briefings [which provide a quick and customised overview of news] from places such as Tech News, the BBC and Reddit (checking Twitter means I get distracted), which is useful. We\u2019re always asking the Echo random questions \u2013 and occasionally playing silly quizzes too \u2013 which definitely alleviates a slow day and boosts camaraderie.\u201d\n\u201cI run a PR agency, which means my job is very varied \u2013 I could be doing anything from having meetings to brainstorming ideas, presenting reports or writing proposals. I use the Echo as soon as I wake \u2013 before, even, as I\u2019ve programmed a series of alarms to wake me up (and to stop me snoozing). Because I often work from home, I keep the Echo near my work computer downstairs, with Echo Dots in both my bedroom and kitchen, so I can listen to the news as I\u2019m getting dressed and making breakfast. That way, I always know key news stories and have a sense of what\u2019s happening in the world. When I want to spend a specific amount of time on a job (say an hour), I\u2019ll use the Echo to set a timer, so I know when to stop. Once you get used to speaking commands, it\u2019s so much easier than fiddling around with an app on your phone \u2013 particularly when in the middle of another task. The background music function is useful, too, for unobtrusive background noise. I\u2019d really recommend it to anyone struggling with productivity \u2013 it\u2019s been incredibly helpful in terms of time management and means I now use my time much more efficiently.\u201d\n\u201cWhen a friend bought an Amazon Echo and raved about how much he liked it, I thought I\u2019d give it a try too. I primarily use my Echo Dot to read out relevant news to me each morning. As well as helping me stay on top of my game, I think it\u2019s helped me build a better rapport with clients and peers too \u2013 for example, before speaking to someone in Singapore, I can quickly check the time using voice commands to make sure I\u2019m calling at an appropriate hour. Before I leave for meetings I\u2019ll check live traffic information and weather, so I always arrive on time, and I\u2019ll use it to order Ubers too (when I do it on my phone, I end up getting distracted mid-task). Another function I like is making video and conference calls \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant not having to wear an uncomfortable headset.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/10-smart-home-devices-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-amazon-echo": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/get-more-from-amazon-alexa/2020/jan/06/10-smart-home-devices-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-amazon-echo", "title": "10 smart-home devices to get the best out of your Amazon Echo", "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2020 17:13:52 GMT", "summary": "<p>Improve your domestic life with these Alexa-enabled products</p><p>According to research by PwC, it\u2019s predicted that <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/industries/power-utilities/insights/energy2020/connected-home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the UK will spend an incredible \u00a310.8bn on smart-home technology in 2019</a>.

Just cutting one disc a week could get you over the 1,000 mark, though I assume most of them would have been recopied and recycled before now.\nThe CD-R recordable format, storing 702MB, was launched in 1982, when my IBM PC/XT\u2019s hard drive stored 10MB. We didn\u2019t get DVD+RW discs storing 4.7GB each until about 1998, when 4GB was a reasonable size for a hard drive. A decade later, an Amazon receipt tells me I bought a 500GB Western Digital My Book for \u00a362.20, so I was probably switching from optical to digital disks some time around 2008, if not before.\nIn theory, we might have switched from DVD to the new Blu-ray discs instead, because a Blu-ray can store either 25GB (single-layer) or 50GB (dual-layer) on archival discs. However, by the time Blu-ray writers became affordable, we already knew that external hard drives were going to win the storage wars. They were getting bigger and cheaper at a rapid pace. Today\u2019s 8TB and larger drives confirm that we were right.\n says: Never put data into a program unless you can see exactly how to get it out. I didn\u2019t think to mention storage, or the effort it might take to retrieve it. Technically, your data is accessible, but the sheer volume of DVDs means it\u2019s not very practical. Moving it to a hard drive makes sense, but there\u2019s no obvious way to do it. Buying specialised hardware would be expensive while doing it manually could take a long time.\nOver the years, many commercial systems have sported multiple DVD drives, sometimes with \n or \n to feed in the discs. But most were aimed at large corporations or service providers, and \n at home users.\nMulti-DVD systems usually targeted either the disc duplication or data sharing markets. Products aimed at the first enabled companies to \n. Products aimed at the second were \n, somewhat like giant jukeboxes. They enabled companies to share data from large numbers of DVDs or BDs, or create \u201ccold storage\u201d backups that could last for 50 years. Facebook, for example, developed a server to store 10,000 Blu-ray discs, and demonstrated the system in a three-minute \n.\nMF Digital\u2019s \n CD/DVD/BD ripper should do what you want, but it costs $4,595, including the built-in PC. It uses a robot arm to pick up discs and drop them into a DVD tray. Products like this are aimed at radio and TV stations, publishing empires and educational institutions that needed \u2013 perhaps still need \u2013 to convert a lot of old discs into digital format. They are not expensive compared with the cost of humans doing it manually.\nI\u2019m not sure if MF Digital\u2019s cheaper \n would do the job because you don\u2019t need to rip your discs, just copy them to a hard drive. However, I suspect \u00a31,699.56 is more than you want to pay for a one-off job.\nThat leaves you with one fast option: find a company that owns a Ripstation 7000 or similar device and offers file transfer as a service. I didn\u2019t manage to find one \u2013 the search terms are tricky \u2013 and the price might still be prohibitive. I\u2019d guess it would cost from 25p to \u00a31 per disk, and 50p doesn\u2019t sound too unreasonable. Even with a bulk deal, moving your data might cost \u00a3500. You\u2019d also face the problem of shipping a very big box of discs at least one way.\nIf anyone knows of an affordable DVD-to-HDD copying service, please let us know in the comments, or email me at the address below.\nIf there\u2019s no quick fix that you can justify on price, you will have to copy every DVD by hand. You could tackle it as a holiday project, but it\u2019s a tedious way to spend your free time. Alternatively, set yourself a target, such as copying five to 10 discs per day, every day. Even with some breaks, you should get it done in a year. If you don\u2019t set a target, you might never finish the job.\nPerhaps you could speed up the process by using two DVD drives, but it depends on the hardware you have available. A PC tower could take two internal DVD drives, but you would probably have to buy and install them.\nAlternatively, you could buy one or two \n and plug them into USB ports, or into a powered USB hub. (Not every USB port provides enough power to run a DVD that doesn\u2019t have its own power supply.) With two drives, you can load a DVD in one drive while the other drive is copying files.\nAfter that, it would be a boon to have some software to detect discs and copy the files automatically. This avoids waiting for the file directory to appear, highlighting the files you want, and dragging them to your hard drive.\n has a utility that does the job well. You check the box for \u201cCopy a lot of CD/DVDs automatically\u201d and start feeding it discs. It copies each one to a new folder that it creates on your hard drive (CDDVD1, CDDVD2 etc), then pops out the DVD tray for the next disc. It\u2019s a small (219K), free program and doesn\u2019t need to be installed, so it\u2019s worth a try.\nI also tried Averk\u2019s free \n, which is even smaller at 184KB. Averk had much the same problem as you \u2013 he wanted to move more than 100 CDs to a hard drive \u2013 and wrote a little utility to do it. Unlike Perfect Automation\u2019s program, AutoCopy 2 includes a countdown timer. While its copying took longer than Perfect Automation on my system, I found that both were faster and more reliable than doing it manually.\nThe first task is to copy all the DVDs to a hard drive and, obviously, to a backup hard drive: you don\u2019t want to do this job twice. You can worry about file formats later.\nOver the long term, the best choices are usually the most common formats, especially if they are ratified international standards. Given the cost of storage nowadays, it\u2019s not worth converting files to more efficient, space-saving formats, because this takes time and may involve some loss of quality. I\u2019m leaving my jpg and png images, mp3 music, avi videos and other files in their original formats.\nI\u2019m converting some videos that were in less popular formats \u2013 such as wmv, mov, flv and rm \u2013 to mp4 with the H.264 codec, which is supported by processors (Intel \n) and most graphics cards. Programs such as \n make this very easy to do. You can also reprocess old videos to remove colour casts, make them look sharper, correct faulty aspect ratios and \u201cupscale\u201d their resolution, though the results from my old VHS-C video camera will never look good by today\u2019s standards.\nEven DVD-quality movies are rarely worth the effort, unless they are of holidays, weddings, or your kids\u2019 birthday parties. DVDs have a resolution of 720 x 480 pixels (American NTSC) or 720 x 540 (UK PAL). Today, we live in a 1080p world (1920 x 1080 pixels) on the way to 4K (3840 x 2160). You can probably watch the same videos in much higher quality on \n, Amazon Prime, \n, YouTube or some other streaming service.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/30/whats-the-minimum-specification-for-someone-buying-a-pc": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/30/whats-the-minimum-specification-for-someone-buying-a-pc", "title": "What\u2019s the minimum specification for someone buying a PC?", "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:00:11 GMT", "summary": "<p>David asks how best to tell if a PC is fast enough for community groups on a limited budget</p><p>I am working on a project that helps various groups in the community to become more PC proficient, and some clients now wish to purchase their own systems for the first time.

Even cheap laptops can run \n Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today\u2019s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.\nAny PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.\nEither way, it\u2019s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.\nI don\u2019t want to repeat \n in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the \n is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.\nFor example, you can start with 4GB of memory, a traditional hard drive, a cast-off screen and a cheap printer, and improve the system when you can afford new parts. Most desktops can now handle up to 32GB or more memory \u2013 \n \u2013 and you can replace a slow hard drive with a fast, chip-based \n. You can easily replace the original monitor with a bigger, brighter screen, which you can\u2019t do with a laptop.\nShort of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it\u2019s done.\nMonitors have improved a lot in the past decade. You can now buy them for \n or \n, so that\u2019s what I usually recommend. The corollary is that most older screens are not worth very much second hand, no matter how much they cost when new.\nSecond hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.\nYou may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.\nThanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, \n usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.\nBut the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for \n and 2GB for browser tabs.\nIndeed, given that memory modules are now cheap \u2013 \n \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to use less.\nSSDs have also plunged in price. Today, 120GB drives go for \n, and 240GB drives can be had for \n. It makes no sense to buy a PC with a 32GB drive, and for Windows 10 users even 64GB is no longer enough.\nWhen a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the \n app (remember to click \u201cClean up system files\u201d) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.\nToday, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or \n is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and \u201cpower users\u201d will want, and often need, more.\nPicking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)\nNo one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it\u2019s using without looking it up. Often, differences don\u2019t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.\nBusinesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It\u2019s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it\u2019s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don\u2019t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn\u2019t care. If you\u2019re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won\u2019t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.\nThere\u2019s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of \u201cnormal\u201d.\nSo, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.\nThe good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today\u2019s standards. In response to the market\u2019s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more \n, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a \n of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.\nThere are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip\u2019s score on the \n and compare it with your own PC\u2019s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don\u2019t matter.)\nFor a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.\nLet\u2019s put those PassMark numbers in context. Even a 6W Pentium Silver N5000, designed for thin laptops, manages \n, which is my minimum. My old Core i5-2500 scores \n, while the i5-3470 used in last week\u2019s refurbished \n (\u00a3135) scores \n. The i5-8400 in my current desktop scores \n. A really fast (and pricey) Core i9-9900K scores \n.\nIn general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you\u2019re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/23/which-is-the-best-pc-for-someone-who-has-parkinsons", "title": "Which is the best PC for someone who has Parkinson\u2019s?", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:49 GMT", "summary": "<p>Richard wants a laptop for its flatter keys, but desktop PCs can have any keyboard type </p><p>I plan to get a new computer for home use, no games.

With a laptop, you are more or less stuck with the keyboard fitted by the manufacturer, and the quality varies from average to mediocre. With a desktop PC, you can take your pick from dozens of USB and Bluetooth keyboards. These range from keyboards with flat, island-style isolated keys to full mechanical keyboards aimed at professionals and gamers.\nSome USB keyboards have \n for children and for grown-ups with vision and other problems. There\u2019s also a programmable membrane keyboard, \n, that doesn\u2019t have keys at all. Helpikeys works with a variety of keyboard overlays, and people can create custom keyboards with its Layout Builder software.\nThere are lots of flat keyboards that might suit you. The wireless Bluetooth options include the \n (\u00a385.76 on Amazon.co.uk) and \n (\u00a371.99) keyboards, plus similar models from \n (\u00a336.99) and \n (\u00a329.99). Personally, I\u2019d go for the silver \n wired USB keyboard (\u00a328.66), though there are cheaper wired options.\nEither way, consider contacting \n, a charity that provides specialist advice on technology to \u201cpeople of any age, living with any disability or impairment\u201d. AbilityNet may also be able to offer you \n through its network of volunteers. It\u2019s a wonderful resource for older people and those with disabilities.\nThere are some good reasons for buying a laptop. The main ones are, first, that you need to use your PC while out and about, or at least in different rooms; and second, that you don\u2019t have room for a desktop monitor and external keyboard.\nSize is no longer a disqualification because you can get tiny \n that will attach to the back of a monitor. However, it\u2019s pretty hard to use a desktop without some sort of desk or table and a chair, and those take up valuable floor space.\nIf you have room for a desktop, there are lots of reasons to buy one. Desktops generally run faster than laptops because they can use faster processors that run hotter. Desktops do not limit your screen size or keyboard quality, so you can optimise the system to your needs. Desktops are easier to expand, update and repair \u2013 you can usually add extra memory, bigger drives and faster graphics cards \u2013 so they should last longer. And if your system is set up correctly, \n, so they are better for your health.\nMost laptops let you plug in an external monitor or screen display, a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, a mouse, headphones, ethernet adapter, and external USB hard drives for backups and extra storage. \n Windows supports multiple displays as standard, so the main problem is picking a cable to connect the second screen to your laptop.\nFor most purposes, we\u2019ve already left behind VGA and DVI connections. Modern TV sets and monitors have HDMI ports, and sometimes others such as DisplayPort. Modern laptops typically have HDMI, DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort connections, and sometimes USB Type C ports.\nIf both devices have HDMI ports, an HDMI cable will do the job. Sometimes you might need an adapter cable such as HDMI-to-DisplayPort, or vice versa. Otherwise, there are cables with VGA, DVI, Mini DisplayPort, DisplayPort or USB-C plugs at one end and HDMI at the other end.\nThere are three problems with this approach. First, your laptop may not have enough ports to plug everything in. Second, it\u2019s tedious to have to unplug all the accessories when you want to take your laptop somewhere, then plug them back in later. Third, you have all the disadvantages of a desktop PC without the advantages.\nIn the early days of business laptops, docking stations alleviated these problems. Accessories \u2013 keyboard, screen, mouse etc \u2013 plugged into the docking station and the laptop docked with that. Dedicated docking stations are still available, but the general-purpose solution is a mini-tower like the \n. Everything plugs into the Plugable, or similar device, so there is only one USB 2 or preferably USB 3 cable to the laptop. There are also USB-C versions that can provide power to the laptop as well as all the various connections.\nYou could take this route if you need a laptop, but it will cost more and not perform as well.\nThe desktop PC is far from being an endangered species, but it has speciated a long way from the \u201cone size fits all\u201d models popular a few decades ago. There are tiny \n 10 PCs for serving media, SFF (small form factor) models for office use, all-in-ones built straight into a screen, high-powered towers for music and video editing, and even more high-powered machines with sci-fi styling and multicoloured lights for gamers. For your purposes, almost any of them would do.\nIf you are on a budget, an acceptable minimum would be something like a Lenovo IdeaCentre 310s with an Intel Pentium J5005 processor, 4GB of memory, DVD and a 1TB hard drive. Currys PC World is selling this PC for \n, and Lenovo offers it online with 8GB for \n. One reason for buying direct is that you can buy three years of on-site support for \u00a348.96.\nHowever, memory is so cheap, I don\u2019t see the point of buying a PC with 4GB of memory, unless you plan to add more. Last year I bought another 8GB (\u00a336) to take my desktop PC up to 16GB.\nYou would also get a much more responsive PC by buying a system with a faster processor, such as an Intel Core i3 or better (ie i5/i7/i9), or the equivalent AMD Ryzen processor and a 128GB or larger \n instead of a traditional hard drive.\nIf you can afford it, go for something like the \n (search for 590-p0057na) with a Ryzen 5 2400G, 8GB of memory, 128GB SSD and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99 at Argos. It\u2019s overkill for your likely needs, but it\u2019s good value. The \n with exactly the same spec costs \u00a3529 at PC World. The \n (who?) version at eBuyer has a 240GB SSD but lacks the 1TB hard drive for \u00a3449.99. This kind of spec should easily last more than five years.\nLarge businesses still buy desktop PCs in large volumes. They generally want something small, reliable and repairable. These machines are written off after a few years, refurbished, and sold to consumers and some small businesses. One of today\u2019s classic buys is the Dell OptiPlex 7010 SFF (\n), with the HP 8100 Elite SFF among the alternatives.\nOne drawback is that their old Intel Core chips aren\u2019t as good as today\u2019s versions.

What should people do next?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/16/im-still-on-windows-7-what-should-i-do\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "Microsoft Windows 7 \u2013 launched in 2009 \u2013 came to the end of its supported life on Tuesday. Despite Microsoft\u2019s repeated warnings to Windows 7 users, there may still be \n, many of them in businesses. What should people do next?\nTo begin with, Windows 7 will not stop working, it will just stop receiving security updates. Users will therefore be more vulnerable to malware attacks, particularly from \u201c\n\u201d. We saw how dangerous that can be when WannaCry took over unpatched PCs in \n. It was so bad that \n, even though it was out of support.\nThere are reasons to be fearful, because of the way the malware industry works.\nOn the second Tuesday of every month, \n releases security patches that should be installed automatically by Windows Update. The malware industry analyses these patches to find the holes, and then looks for ways to exploit them. A lot of the code in Windows 10 goes back to Windows 7 and earlier versions. As a result, some of the security holes in Windows 10 will also be present in Windows 7, but they won\u2019t be patched.\n writers don\u2019t normally target out-of-date operating systems, because they don\u2019t usually have many users. In this case, as with XP, there could be millions of relatively easy targets.\nThe British government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \n: \u201cWe would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts.\u201d That\u2019s good advice.\nThe NCSC\u2019s website suggests some \u201c\n\u201d. It\u2019s aimed mainly at government departments and businesses, and isn\u2019t specific to Windows 7.\nThe core advice boils down to this: avoid coming into contact with any malware, and make sure you have nothing to lose. The first is basically impossible in a world where malware can be served via advertisements (\u201cmalvertising\u201d) even on respectable websites. The second is tedious but essential.\nWhile you can\u2019t patch Windows 7, you can \n. That applies to browsers in particular. Fortunately, the main browser suppliers will keep updating them, and \n: \u201cWe will continue to fully support Chrome on Windows 7 for a minimum of 18 months from Microsoft\u2019s end of life date, until at least 15 July 2021.\u201d\nEventually, however, they\u2019ll stop testing their browsers on \n because it\u2019s expensive and will only serve a shrinking number of users.\nIf you can\u2019t avoid malware completely, try to avoid untrusted or insecure websites. Major name-brand websites should be reasonably safe, including your bank\u2019s. Sources of free, pirated or \u201cadult\u201d stuff are generally less so. But, sooner or later, your bank will decide that it\u2019s too risky to deal with people who have vulnerable computers, and prevent you from logging on.\nRunning good anti-virus software and a firewall should help minimise the risk, so it may be worth paying for something like Kaspersky Total Security. However, no security software is foolproof, and it won\u2019t patch your unpatched operating system.\nYou must also be super-suspicious about emails, and never click unsolicited attachments. According to \n, spam and phishing emails caused 67% of ransomware infections in 2019, causing $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) worth of damage.\n and other serious attacks is not having anything to lose. Keep copies of all your valuable data on external hard drives and thumb-drives and possibly online, and as little as possible on your Windows 7 PC. Make daily backups to a storage device that is not otherwise attached to your PC, and keep a current disk image handy. You\u2019ll never have to pay a ransom if you can just wipe the infected drive and restore your PC from a backup.\nGiven the risks of running Windows 7, users should plan to replace it as soon as possible. The options include \n 10, Linux and CloudReady, which is based on Google\u2019s Chromium OS. In effect, it turns your PC into a Chromebook.\nWindows 10 is the best option for most ordinary Windows 7 users. Although it has some additional stuff, Windows 10 still has most of the features of Windows 7, and \n. It will run most, if not all, of your existing software, and you will have to do the least amount of relearning. Decades of Windows experience will still be useful.\nMicrosoft offered Windows 7 users a free in-place upgrade to Windows 10 during the year after its launch, and it would have been sensible to take it. Since then, you have been able to download a copy of Windows 10 and \n. So far, most users who have tried this and entered their Windows 7 product key have had their copy of Windows 10 authenticated. I can\u2019t say whether that will continue to work. However, Microsoft wants people off Windows 7 and on to Windows 10, so it\u2019s worth a go. Just skip the part where it asks for a product key, and leave it for later.\nIf you install Windows 10, you can use it for a month. After that, you will get a \u201cwatermark\u201d on your desktop that says it isn\u2019t authenticated, and Microsoft will nag you to do it. You will also lose personalisation options, so you won\u2019t be able to change the wallpaper, themes, lock screen and so on, but it will continue to work. Using an unauthenticated copy of Windows 10 is not a long-term solution, and it\u2019s a bad idea for businesses, which can \n. However, if you\u2019re a Windows 7 home user, it gives you more time to decide what to do.\nIf Windows 10 runs well on your PC, you might decide to pay to authenticate it. If it doesn\u2019t run well, you can still try a different option, such as \n, \n or \n.\nAlternatively, keep Windows 7 for offline use, and use a \u201clive Linux\u201d for internet access.\nMany people are familiar with the idea of running Linux from a \u201clive CD\u201d or DVD, which doesn\u2019t interfere with the current desktop operating system. There are not many DVD drives around nowadays, so the modern equivalent is to run it from a thumb-drive. You can create one with a tool such as \n or \n. Thumb-drives are slow, so you won\u2019t get great performance, but it will keep you safe online. You\u2019ll also find out if you can live with Linux.\nThe problem with buying Windows 10 Home from the Windows Store is the price: \n. You can buy laptops running Windows 10 for less than that, and usable laptops for not much more. For example, you could get a brand new \n (11.6in screen) from Argos for \u00a3159.99, or a \n (14in screen) for \u00a3179.99. Both have slow Intel Celeron N4000 processors and 4GB of memory, and they are called \u201ccloudbooks\u201d because of their limited 64GB of storage. Like Chromebooks, they are designed to work online. Unlike Chromebooks, they can run Microsoft Office and other Windows programs.\nA better buy would be an \n with a Pentium Silver N5000, 4GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for \u00a3239.99 at eBuyer.\nAlternatively, you could buy a refurbished laptop or desktop already running Windows 10. For example, \n has a small ex-corporate HP desktop with a Core i3-3220 processor, 4GB of memory, 500GB hard drive and one-year guarantee for \n. It has lots of ThinkPad laptops at prices from \n (X240 with an i3-4010U and 4GB) or less to \n (X1 Carbon with an i5-4210U, 8GB and a 128GB SSD) or more. Tier1Online will also add extra memory and SSDs to most of its machines, if required. You can extend the guarantee to three years for \u00a340.\nYou can also buy refurbished laptops from \n and various suppliers on Amazon or eBay. \n is a government-backed scheme that offers extra discounts to people on benefits, and there are \n.\nIf all else fails, you may be able to get a free laptop running Windows 10 from a recycling group such as \n or \n, or from a friend of a friend.\nWindows 7 hasn\u2019t been current since 2012, when Windows 8 was launched. Processors have advanced a lot since then, and SSDs have mostly replaced hard drives. Somebody else\u2019s cast-off PC may be newer and faster than the one you\u2019ve been using for five or 10 years.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/19/how-can-i-get-better-at-using-google-search", "title": "How can I get better at using Google search?", "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:00:43 GMT", "summary": "<p>Michael struggles to find the search results he\u2019s looking for, and would like some tips for better Googling</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/dec/12/duckduckgo-google-search-engine-privacy\">Last week\u2019s column</a> mentioned search skills.

Suddenly, people who were not very good at searching \u2013 which is almost everyone \u2013 could get good results without entering long, complex searches. Partly this was because Google knew which pages were most important, based on its \n algorithm, and it knew which pages were most effective, because users quickly bounced back from websites that didn\u2019t deliver what they wanted.\nLater, \n added personalisation based on factors such as your location, your previous searches, your visits to other websites, and other things it knew about you. This created a backlash from people with privacy concerns, because your searches into physical and mental health issues, legal and social problems, relationships and so on can reveal more about you than you want anyone else \u2013 or even a machine \u2013 to know.\nWhen talking about avoiding \u201c\n\u201d, former Google boss \n: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you\u2019ve been. We can more or less know what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\nGoogle hasn\u2019t got to that point, yet, but it does want to save you from typing. Today, Google does this through a combination of \n search suggestions, \n, and \u201c\n\u201d boxes, which show related questions along with their \u201c\n\u201d. As a result, Google is much less likely to achieve its stated aim of sending you to another website. According to Jumpshot research, about \n, and about 6% go to Google-owned properties such as YouTube and Maps.\nYou could get upset about Google scraping websites such as Wikipedia for information and then keeping their traffic, but this is the way the world is going. Typing queries into a browser is becoming redundant as more people use voice recognition on smartphones or ask the virtual assistant on their smart speakers. Voice queries need direct answers, not pages of links.\nSo, I can give you some search tips, but they may not be as useful as they were when I wrote about them in \n \u2013 or perhaps not for as long.\nThe easiest way to create advanced search queries in Google is to use the form on the \n, though I suspect very few people do. You can type different words, phrases or numbers that you want to include or exclude into the various boxes. When you run the search, it converts your input into a single string using search shortcuts such as quotation marks (to find an exact word or phrase) and minus signs (to exclude words).\nYou can also use the form to narrow your search to a particular language, region, website or domain, or to a type of file, how recently it was published and so on. Of course, nobody wants to fill in forms. However, using the forms will teach you most of the commands mentioned below, and it\u2019s a fallback if you forget any.\nHappily, many commands work on other search engines too, so skills are transferable.\nIf you are looking for something specific, quotation marks are invaluable. Putting quotation marks around single words tells the search engine that you definitely want them to appear on every page it finds, rather than using close matches or synonyms. Google will, of course, ignore this, but at least the results page will tell you which word it has ignored. You can click on that word to insist, but you will get fewer or perhaps no results.\nPutting a whole phrase in inverted commas has the same effect, and is useful for finding quotations, people\u2019s names, book and film titles, or particular phrases.\nYou can also use an asterisk as a wildcard to find matching phrases. For example, The Simpsons episode, Deep Space Homer, popularised the phrase: \u201cI for one welcome our new insect overlords\u201d. Searching for \u201cI for one welcome our new * overlords\u201d finds other overlords such as aliens, \n, computers, robots and squirrels.\nNowadays, Google\u2019s \n is pretty good at recognising titles and common phrases without quote marks, even if they include \u201c\n\u201d such as a, at, that, the and this. You don\u2019t need quotation marks to search for the Force, The Who or The Smiths.\nHowever, it also uses synonyms rather than strictly following your keywords. It can be quicker to use minus signs to exclude words you don\u2019t want than add terms that are already implied. One example is jaguar -car.\nGoogle also has a site: command that lets you limit your search to a particular website or, with a minus sign (-site:), exclude it. This command uses the site\u2019s uniform resource locator or \n.\nFor example, if you wanted to find something on the Guardian\u2019s website, you would type site:theguardian.com (no space after the colon) alongside your search words.\nYou may not need to search the whole site. For example, site:theguardian.com/technology/askjack will search the Ask Jack posts that are online, though it doesn\u2019t search all the ancient texts (\n).\nThere are several similar commands. For example, inurl: will search for or exclude words that appear in URLs. This is handy because many sites now pack their URLs with keywords as part of their \n (search-engine optimisation). You can also search for intitle: to find words in titles.\nWeb pages can include incidental references to all sorts of things, including plugs for unrelated stories. All of these will duly turn up in text searches. But if your search word is part of the URL or the title, it should be one of the page\u2019s main topics.\nYou can also use site: and inurl: commands to limit searches to include, or exclude, whole groups of websites. For example, either site:co.uk or inurl:co.uk will search matching UK websites, though many UK sites now have .com addresses. Similarly, site:ac.uk and inurl:ac.uk will find pages from British educational institutions, while inurl:edu and site:edu will find American ones. Using inurl:ac.uk OR inurl:edu (the \n must be in caps) will find pages from both. Using site:gov.uk will find British government websites, and inurl:https will search secure websites. There are lots of options for inventive searchers.\nGoogle Search can also find different types of file, using either filetype: or ext: (for file extension). These include office documents (docx, pptx, xlxs, rtf, odt, odp, odx etc) and pdf files. Results depend heavily on the topic. For example, a search for picasso filetype:pdf is more productive than one for stormzy.\nWe often want up-to-date results, particularly in technology where things that used to be true are not true any more. After you have run a search, you can use Google\u2019s time settings to filter the results, or use new search terms. To do this, click Tools, click the down arrow next to \u201cAny time\u201d, and use the dropdown menu to pick a time period between \u201cPast hour\u201d and \u201cPast year\u201d.\nLast week, I was complaining that Google\u2019s \u201cfreshness algorithm\u201d could serve up lots of blog-spam, burying far more useful hits. Depending on the topic, you can use a custom time range to get less fresh but perhaps more useful results.\nCustom time settings are even more useful for finding contemporary coverage of events, which might be \n, a \n, or \n. Human memories are good at rewriting history, but contemporaneous reports can provide a more accurate picture.\nHowever, custom date ranges have disappeared from mobile, the daterange: command no longer seems to work in search boxes, and \u201csort by date\u201d has gone except in news searches. Instead, this year, \n to do the same job. For example, you could search for \u201cApple iPod\u201d before:2002-05-31 after:2001-10-15 for a bit of nostalgia. The date formats are very forgiving, so one day we may all prefer it.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast", "title": "The rise of facial recognition technology \u2013 podcast", "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2020 03:00:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the Metropolitan police in London.

In this world, renting literally isn\u2019t an option.\nFor a generation of fans, that stands in stark contrast to real life. The Resolution Foundation, a housing thinktank, reported in 2018 that up to \n, and the number of households privately renting in England \n in the 10 years after 1996, according to the most recent Labour Force Survey. With young people disproportionately more likely to rent than older generations, many have turned to The Sims to decorate a house that feels like their own.\n\u201cRenting means your aesthetics are limited to pieces you can easily take with you and not bigger things like fixtures on the walls, window styles and paint jobs,\u201d says 29-year-old \n, who lives with their parents, a grandparent and a brother. \n\u201cWe also didn\u2019t want to do anything major in case the landlord raised any complaints,\u201d they explain. Howlane has found an outlet in The Sims, where the dream house they\u2019ve built is a modest two-bedroom place with a reasonably sized kitchen and room for some gym equipment. The modesty is touching, and somewhat sad \u2013 in real life, it\u2019s nothing more than a pipe dream.\nRhiannon Williams, 23, has lived in four rented homes over the past five years, all shared. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have others \u2013 especially a landlord \u2013 sharing the decision making, I could try things out and change the space more often,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Sims is definitely a medium I use to build those fantasies, and it\u2019s perfect for the flexibility aspect because it\u2019s so easy to make changes. I can try out a new sofa in moments rather than having two months of emails with my landlord to get approval!\u201d\nWilliams also craves stability, and a home where she can create long-term design plans. \u201cI think my real-life housing situation has affected how I play The Sims,\u201d she continues. \u201cI love the ability to create places that are always there to go back to, and that I can design and change to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d\nAccording to Roxy Wolosenko, a designer on the original game, that\u2019s what the game\u2019s creator, Will Wright, wanted to facilitate. \u201cHe was really interested in exploring how people felt in different kinds of spaces, and what makes people feel comfortable,\u201d she says. The inspiration for the game was the architect and theorist Christopher Alexander, whose 1977 book A Pattern Language sought to teach people the fundaments of home design in an accessible way.\nFor two decades The Sims has offered the joy of design, without the risk of angering a housemate or, worse, a landlord. The game presents a utopian world of home ownership, where everybody starts out with the same opportunities and can progress from a single-bedroom apartment to a vast palatial mansion as long as they put in the effort. It\u2019s no wonder fans have drawn considerable comfort from building homes that truly feel theirs \u2013 even if it is just a fantasy.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/03/video-games-where-you-do-almost-nothing", "title": "And relax \u2026 the joy of video games where you do almost nothing", "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:03:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>More and more people are using games like quiet background experiences, requiring minimal attention while they sew, cook or study</p><p>In the recently released game <a href=\"http://coffeetalk.info/\">Coffee Talk</a>, you play a coffee-shop barista who stands at a counter, through long, rainy Seattle nights, making drinks for customers as they tell you about their lives.

Elves tell you about their love lives, insomniac werewolves seek calm and quiet \u2013 you listen and you try to make drinks that will soothe them.\nCoffee Talk comes from a long line of quietly transgressive games that don\u2019t ask much of the player, that defy the popular notion of video games as a hectic, dizzying pursuit where buttons are bashed and the onscreen action is intense and demanding. \n, like music, can sometimes sit in the background, asking for little more than occasional check-ins. In the early 1980s, I loved to travel vast distances in the space simulation game Elite, watching the pixel stars and hollow planets swoop by, perhaps encountering the odd freighter. I\u2019d put the game on in the background while I did my homework.\nLater, PC owners all over the world were transfixed by Myst, the slow, silent puzzle game that had you visiting almost still images of a deserted island, in between spreadsheet chores. The visual novel genre, vastly popular in Japan, requires little more from players than button presses to select conversational options \u2013 playing Steins;Gate, \n or \n is like checking in with a WhatsApp chat, just one with more Japanese high schools, trans-dimensional monsters and interspecies\u2019 dating than usual.\nOpen world games have become hangouts for a lot of players. You can sit on a hill in Minecraft and watch the sun travel across the sky; you can park your car in Grand Theft Auto V and the world moves around you. A few days ago, I tweeted asking friends for the games they treated like quiet background music. Lots of people mentioned gentle life sims such as \n and Stardew Valley, which writer Ria Jenkins told me she plays while watching Love Island; several opted for professional sims such as Euro Truck Simulator and \n, where you just drop in on a job and carry out mundane tasks. Xbox social strategist and streamer Charleyy Hodson talked about the multiplayer game \n: \u201cMy entire family loves checking in once a day, planting some new crops and picking some flowers. Then we come back the next day to check in again.\u201d\nExperimental indie games often fulfil this role as an unobtrusive element in our endlessly partial attention spans. The exploration mode in action adventure Concrete Genie, the road movie-like Jalopy, the letter-writing game Kind Words \u2013 can be checked in on or left running. Guardian contributor and Gadget Show presenter \n plays the Shakespearean comedy game Astrologaster while doing cross stitch, \u201cjust pressing a button every now and then to advance things\u201d.\nFor many people, the arrival of \u201cappointment\u201d games on Facebook and mobile phones \u2013 such as Farmville and Words With Friends, where you check in and out on the experience throughout the day \u2013 provided a gateway to the idea that games don\u2019t have to be all-consuming. At the same time, our modern dual-screen culture of watching TV while browsing a smartphone or tablet device, has prepared for us a mental space in which seemingly competing inputs can be experienced concurrently.\nCoffee Talk is clever in that it holds the player in a transient social space, where people flit in and out, giving us glimpses of other lives, and it provides no time pressures, no long-term goals. You\u2019re just there. You just listen and serve. It feels authentic and lived in, and it is \u2013 as Kris Antoni Hadiputra, founder of Toge Productions, the Indonesian studio behind the game explains:\nVideo games are about interactivity, of course, but interactivity doesn\u2019t have to mean ceaselessly hitting buttons and guiding an on-screen character, vehicle or weapon. Interactivity can mean quietly inhabiting a space, or just checking in on it, and for a few seconds lending our attention to something benign and beguiling.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/31/the-sims-at-20-two-decades-of-life-love-and-reorganising-the-kitchen", "title": "The Sims at 20: two decades of life, love and reorganising the kitchen", "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:03:10 GMT", "summary": "<p>In The Sims, if you get a job, buy a house and earn more money then happiness will follow.

One thing creator Will Wright realised very early on was that the game was appealing to a large female audience.

A friend\u2019s mother played so much Sims that she forgot to clean the actual house for weeks.\nMortifyingly, some teen pals and I used The Sims 2 to insert ourselves into elaborate Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanfiction. A university classmate created the cast of Friends, and used them to play out a drama that was definitely better than the final season of the show. My own personal obsession with The Sims was so all-consuming that when The Sims 3 arrived in 2009, I had to cut myself off in case I failed my degree. One of my lecturers, spotting The Sims open on my laptop in class, admitted to the worryingly common virtual crime of drowning his Sims in their own pool by deleting the ladders.\nPart of the appeal of video games is control \u2013 not just the act of controlling a character\u2019s actions, but the greater control of understanding a set of rules and systems and bending them to your will. The Sims is so enormously compelling because it offers the fantasy of control over life itself, including all the things that are so maddeningly unpredictable in the real world \u2013 relationships, careers, family, house renovations. The rules of The Sims essentially state that if you work hard and do everything you\u2019re supposed to do \u2013 get a job, buy a house, progress through the ranks to earn more money and buy more stuff \u2013 happiness will follow. It\u2019s a beguiling capitalist fantasy \u2013 and even if things aren\u2019t going well, you can always type in the \u201cmotherlode\u201d cheat code to shower yourself in riches.\nIn the 20 years since the original Sims arrived to distract us all from homework and housework (with virtual homework and housework), the series has evolved and expanded, its underlying artificial intelligence code becoming ever more sophisticated. Where originally Sims were miniature automatons, later they developed personalities, aspirations and foibles alongside their basic needs for food, money and toilet facilities. They even developed free will: from The Sims 2 onwards you could flip a switch and the simulation would play out without your input, the Sims making decisions about whom to hook up with and how long to spend in the bath, according to their own virtual whims.\nSome of my favourite times with The Sims have come when the little people are operating independently of me, sometimes so uncannily that it freaked me out. Once, as a teen, I created a replica of my real-life home to see what would happen, and it generated such an accurate facsimile of our family dynamic \u2013 dad yelling at my slobby brother to get off the couch, me arguing with my mum in the kitchen, me writing furiously in a diary late into the night \u2013 that I started to wonder if we weren\u2019t \n. And I wasn\u2019t even a fan of the Simulation Hypothesis. Or high.\nNew games have sent Sims off to college, seen them celebrate birthdays and engagements and new year parties, introduced pets and tiny houses and mermaids. And have you \nwhat Sims fans are doing nowadays? A vast, dedicated community of crafters has made hundreds of thousands of new things to adorn Sim dwellings. Some make an actual living building perfect houses or directing Sims soap operas on YouTube. And of course, they\u2019ve made countless explicit sex mods.\nThe Sims is more than a dolls\u2019 house for the digital generation. In many respects it is a post-literate utopia, powered by love and money. There is no racial prejudice, no gender pay gap. Gay marriage arrived in The Sims years before it did in real life. And as its simulation has become ever more clever, it has let players experiment not simply with home decor and fashions, but with human nature and motivation. Players have used The Sims to explore everything from their own gender identity, to complicated family dynamics, to what would happen if you \n and made them have sex.\nI sometimes wonder what The Sims would be like if it were closer to how real life actually worked \u2013 if it saddled you with crippling university debt, made you pay extortionate rent on a tiny flat instead of letting you build your dream home, had you chasing after people who\u2019ll never love you back and working for years without earning the promotion you deserve. But a more realistic Sims would be depressing to play, because really, the point of The Sims is to make life\u2019s everyday trials, labours and rituals seem fun and full of possibilities. Has a video game ever had a more valuable and worthwhile aim?\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/27/what-pokemon-can-teach-us-about-storytelling-nintendo-games", "title": "What Pok\u00e9mon can teach us about storytelling", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 07:00:45 GMT", "summary": "<p>Since 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon games have exerted a fascination for fans, telling imaginative stories and encouraging a generation of players to question everything they see</p><p>\u201cThis is it?

My boyfriend, who has never played Pok\u00e9mon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so \u2026\n.\u201d\nI consider, for the first time, what the \n games look like to a person who has never played them. They \n slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The \u201cbattles\u201d you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the \u201cmoves\u201d? You see very little of them. Rattata uses \u201ctackle\u201d and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.\nWhy have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pok\u00e9mon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Pok\u00e9mon, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The guilt you feel when it\u2019s time to bench your Pidgeot \u2013 the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 \u2013 because you know he can\u2019t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. \nThe game encourages you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style \u201cFind the princess!\u201d prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.\nOne visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pok\u00e9mon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pok\u00e9mon \u201cfaint\u201d if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we\u2019ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pok\u00e9mon die and they are mourned.\nThat\u2019s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: \u201cGhosts appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Tower. I think they\u2019re the spirits of Pok\u00e9mon that the Rockets killed.\u201d\nSo Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of \n and \n, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. \nTake the gym leaders. These are the game\u2019s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock\u2019s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge\u2019s deranged Electric-type gym you\u2019re forced to sort through trash before he\u2019ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate \u2013 do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that\u2019s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it\u2019s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pok\u00e9mon.\nFrom the beginning, Pok\u00e9mon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave \n about the mysterious and elusive Pok\u00e9mon named Mew, which was added to Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. \u201cThere were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,\u201d Tajiri explained. \u201cIt created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there \u2026 It kept the interest alive.\u201d\nFor decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player; for years, many players believed that Mew was \n.\nThe sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly guardians, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric \n, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn\u2019t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pok\u00e9mon who are willing to fight for you \u2013 it all makes sense.\nAs a novelist, I\u2019m keenly aware that people won\u2019t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience; it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pok\u00e9mon games, if I weren\u2019t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: \u201cI like shorts. They\u2019re comfy and easy to wear.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll understand.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jan/24/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review-switch-atlus-nintendo-tokyo-anime", "title": "Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore review \u2013 an enchanting world of wannabe idols", "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 07:00:18 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Switch; Atlus/Nintendo</strong><br>A group of magical youngsters do battle on the streets of Tokyo in this endearing, addictive anime-like role-playing game</p><p>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore is an unlikely candidate for mainstream success in the western market.

The gap between the Premiership and Championship was wide enough already before the Rugby Football Union turned it into a chasm with \n. Life was already hard for players and clubs; now many fear it will be nigh on impossible to continue in their current form.\nFor a taste of reality away from the glamour of the Six Nations and the Premiership, consider instead the story of the former Bedford Blues and Canada player Justin Blanchet. As recently as September, he was still vying for selection for his country\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad. The week before the team landed in Japan, playing in a warmup Test against the USA in Vancouver, he suffered his fourth concussion in 12 months. With a history of head injuries already, it proved one too many for the Montreal-born back-rower.\nThe 26-year-old\u2019s abrupt departure from the game went mostly unnoticed among the rugby public. Yet Blanchet\u2019s story underlines the stark realities of professional rugby, particularly that of England\u2019s second tier. Outside the Premiership, there is no safety net if things go wrong.\n\u201cThere is a feeling, particularly in the Championship, of whether it is all worth it,\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cI became frustrated with rugby. I was giving up so much of my body, my mind and emotion. Most \n players are on significantly less than people may think.\n\u201cPersonally, I just didn\u2019t feel I was being properly remunerated. When players are earning no more than \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 and start getting injuries, questions begin coming into your head.\u201d\nIn the case of Blanchet, who has seven Canada caps to his name and has also played at Exeter Chiefs, last year was the final straw. \u201cAs a sports person you are selfish with a narrow view of things and my goal was the World Cup. I knew the more I told the medical team about my head injuries, the less likely I would be going to the tournament.\n\u201cBut my body was failing me. On top of my head injuries, within a year I had two broken arms that never felt like they were healing fully.\u201d\nIn the Championship, even before the current financial model is ripped up, getting injured can spell disaster financially. Blanchet considers himself one of the lucky ones because Bedford ensure their players are properly covered in terms of medical insurance. It is not the case everywhere.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not great if I\u2019m honest. You hear of horror stories from other clubs of those not covered, something that is unfathomable. In the Championship, there is no support network. It is sad to feel that in a professional setup there is no one acting on your behalf. In all honesty it feels a bit amateur,\u201d says Blanchet, who holds an economics degree from the University of Exeter.\n\u201cA few years ago, there was a story in the Guardian about \n. I think that\u2019s bang on. I think the Rugby Players\u2019 Association is great but the fact they don\u2019t cover the whole of the professional environment needs to be addressed. Why is there not a group for everyone playing the game professionally?\u201d\nBlanchet\u2019s story is not uncommon in the Championship. The league may have helped numerous players along the road to international recognition but that does not paint the full picture. The English second tier is not a lush pasture for professional players to graze on, particularly if bad luck strikes.\n\u201cInjuries don\u2019t just cost you appearances, they cost you a contract, a way of literally paying the bills,\u201d says Blanchet. \u201cSquads and budgets are small and clubs don\u2019t have the resources to keep someone who is injury prone. I\u2019ve seen it so many times. There is that added pressure of feeling you need to get back on the field even if you aren\u2019t 100%. I\u2019m sure many players will testify to the same feelings I had. Physically and financially I felt I was stagnating with it all.\u201d\nAs the Premiership salary cap debate rages on, it is also worth remembering that plenty of players are being paid a pittance for taking precisely the same risks as their top-tier cousins. It is a situation that will only worsen next season when the RFU cuts the annual central funding for each club from \u00a3530,000 to \u00a3280,000. Many Championship players say they frequently feel like second-class citizens.\n\u201cJust having access to work experience days would be huge, or even having an individual for players to contact if they need help on a personal matter,\u201d adds Blanchet. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m lucky that I have incredible support from my family and girlfriend, but not everyone may have that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret rugby, it has given me some important life skills and has allowed me to meet some incredible people. Ultimately, though, the transition when you finish is incredibly challenging. I just stress to all players to look after yourself and think about life outside of rugby.\u201d\nFortunately for Saracens, their players will continue to be looked after by the RPA as part of the parachute payments that go to the teams relegated to the Championship. Funding from the RFU will also not be such a pressing issue. Blanchet\u2019s story, though, is all too typical among those who will be dining at the same table as Saracens next season.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/alisher-usmanov-olympic-manifesto-everton": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/alisher-usmanov-olympic-manifesto-everton", "title": "Alisher Usmanov\u2019s remedy for love?

As Bach advised delegates at the ceremony: \u201cBe a part of the change you want to see.\u201d\nDespite being a man not universally hailed as a great listener, perhaps Usmanov took Bach\u2019s friendly advice on board. He has now made known his identity as the buyer of the De Coubertin manifesto, which \u2013 in a sensational act of kindness \u2013 \n. On Monday he posed for pictures with an emotional Bach and the document. \u201cPierre de Coubertin had a vision of a world united by athletic pursuits and not divided by confrontations and wars,\u201d Usmanov declared. \u201cI believe that the Olympic Museum is the most appropriate place to keep this priceless manuscript.\u201d\nTotally. For his part, Bach was lengthily effusive, offering several variations on: \u201cToday we are witnessing history.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d been grateful to Usmanov. At the same December ceremony that Usmanov was awarded the trophy of Olympic Values, the International Fencing Federation opted to present a gong to the person who has shown \u201cthe most chivalrous and unselfish attitude and spirit of sportsmanship and fair play\u201d. And in an instance of synchronicity you\u2019d struggle to describe as anything other than Jungian, that person turned out to be none other than Thomas Bach. I know! What are the chances?\nCoincidentally, Bach is a former fencer, along with Usmanov, Pavel Kolobkov, who was until two weeks ago the Russian sports minister, and the Russian Olympic Committee chair, Stanislav Pozdnyakov. But please don\u2019t think this is some kind of closed shop. For instance, in 2015, Bach presented the Olympic Order to the president of the Russian Rhythmic Gymnastic Federation, who \u2013 in unrelated news - is related to Usmanov by marriage. Specifically, she is his wife.\nWhat else can be said about Usmanov? Formerly a significant investor in Facebook, he controls Russia\u2019s second biggest phone network, has a stake in its largest internet company and owns Metalloinvest, a hugely successful mining company which still sounds like someone named it in a hurry. \u201cJust call it... Metall \u2026 o \u2026 invest. Metalloninvest. Shut up \u2013 it sounds fine \u2013 just file the paperwork and let\u2019s start coining it.\u201d Other than that, Alisher\u2019s interweb presence has been carefully curated. When one PR firm overstepped the mark by editing unpleasantness out of his Wikipedia entry, they swiftly coughed to acting alone. So please don\u2019t picture Usmanov\u2019s image management as a sort of hole in the wall, through which tainted internet has been passed, while samples of clean internet have been passed the other way.\nWhichever way you slice it, though, it\u2019s been a busy couple of sport-related months for Usmanov. Aside from the lynching letter and the reciprocal awardfest with Bach, he also \n. Everton\u2019s majority shareholder is Usmanov\u2019s business partner, Farhad Moshiri. Much of this football activity on Usmanov\u2019s behalf is apparently to get over his love for Arsenal, after \n. \u201cWhat is the remedy for love? New love,\u201d he explained to the FT in a recent lunchtime interview, possibly as part of a PR blitz. This, he said, was why he was able to \u201cmove on\u201d from Arsenal to Everton. \u201cIf you think like a Muslim, who can have four wives, or a harem.\u201d\nWell, put like that. Usmanov used the same interview to stress he wasn\u2019t an oligarch. \u201cBut I would be indecent to say the state didn\u2019t give me this opportunity. All the time, since I started doing big business, with big industrial assets, the power, the state, has been very co-operative and helpful and never refused us anything,\u201d he says. Of Putin he acknowledged that the Russian president \u201cis the number one leader in the world\u201d but dismissed the idea he did him favours. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need anything.\u201d\nThat feels vaguely debatable. In the area of, say, sport, Putin arguably really needs this whole Olympic ban to go away. By way of a recap, Wada recommended a blanket ban on all Russian athletes for the 2016 Rio Olympics after its massive, state-sponsored cheating programme had been at least partially exposed, though this was helpfully fudged so that only some sports were prevented from competing. Alas, Russia was entirely banned from competing under its own flag at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games. And given that misfortune comes in threes, it is perhaps no surprise the hapless nation has been banned from competing this year in Tokyo.\nI guess the question for a country apparently unwilling to alter certain aspects of its competitive behaviour is: are there any OTHER ways of being the change the IOC apparently wants to see?\nOnly time will show. Russia is appealing the latest Wada ban. In 2017 Usmanov claimed the ban on Russia \u201ccontradicts the principles of the Olympic movement\u201d. Back then this plea was ignored \u2013 but perhaps he and Russia will have better luck this time. After all, who better to trust on the principles of the Olympic movement than the man who bought the original document of the principles of the Olympic movement?\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/f1-chinese-gp-set-to-be-called-off-due-to-coronavirus-with-vietnam-race-at-risk": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/f1-chinese-gp-set-to-be-called-off-due-to-coronavirus-with-vietnam-race-at-risk", "title": "F1's Chinese GP called off because of coronavirus with Vietnam race at risk", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:21:29 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Race set for 19 April unlikely to be rescheduled</li><li>Inaugural Vietnam GP on 5 April also in doubt</li></ul><p>The Chinese Grand Prix has been postponed because of the outbreak of the coronavirus.

There is a possibility the race, which was set to take place in Shanghai on 19 April, could be rescheduled for later in the season but it is unlikely. The health threat has also raised doubts about the feasibility of the inaugural Vietnam Grand Prix, which is set to take place on 5 April.\nA joint statement from the FIA and F1 management was released on Wednesday, confirming what had been expected since the coronavirus has spread across \n. They acknowledged the postponement had been at the request of the race promoters.\nTheir statement said: \u201cIn view of the continued spread of novel coronavirus and after ongoing discussions with the Federation of Automobile and Motorcycle Sports of People\u2019s Republic of China (CAMF) and Shanghai Administration of Sports, the Chinese Grand Prix promoter, Juss Sports Group, has officially requested the 2020 FIA Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix be postponed.\u201d\nThe FIA and F1 recognised the danger posed by the virus and accepted the request to postpone the race. \u201cAs a result of continued health concerns and with the World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus as a global health emergency, the FIA and Formula 1 have taken these measures in order to ensure the health and safety of the travelling staff, championship participants and fans, which remains of primary concern,\u201d the statement added.\nThe coronavirus has claimed more than a thousand lives in China, and Shanghai is just 500 miles from Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Two weeks ago Dr Sergio Brusin, a senior expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm told the Guardian \n, warning of the dangers of mass gatherings of people.\nF1\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, conceded last week the race was under threat but was open to the potential to reschedule it. \u201cWe will leave open the opportunity to see if the race can run later in the year,\u201d he said. On Wednesday the FIA and F1 reiterated their commitment to attempting to reschedule the meeting if possible.\nTheir statement said: \u201cThe FIA and Formula 1 continue to work closely with the teams, race promoter, CAMF and the local authorities to monitor the situation as it develops. All parties will take the appropriate amount of time to study the viability of potential alternative dates for the grand prix later in the year should the situation improve.\u201d\nAs things stand, if the promoter requests to postpone the race for safety reasons its first intent would be to reschedule in order to ensure it does not lose its race fee. However, with a 22-race season this year a new slot would be exceptionally difficult to work into the calendar. The Russian GP, which is set for September and is scheduled between the Singapore and Japanese races, has already ruled out exchanging dates with China. Finding another weekend that would work logistically for transporting teams and equipment would be very difficult and almost certainly require a commitment to racing on three consecutive weekends.\nThe grand prix is the latest in a series of events that have been cancelled because of the coronavirus. The Shanghai authorities this month suspended local sporting events in the city. Formula E cancelled its meeting set to be held in Sanya on 21 March and the World Indoor Athletics Championships, scheduled in Nanjing between 12-15 March, have also been called off. The women\u2019s Olympic football Group B qualifying matches for Australia, China, Taiwan and Thailand have been cancelled and Great Britain\u2019s women\u2019s Olympic basketball qualifying tournament was moved from Foshan in China to Serbia. Foshan is 1,000km from Wuhan but the tournament was deemed too much of a risk to stage.\nVietnam\u2019s first F1 grand prix is due to take place in Hanoi, which is located 100 miles from the Chinese border. As of Wednesday the country has confirmed 15 cases of the coronavirus.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/henry-slade-england-six-nations-training-camp": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/henry-slade-england-six-nations-training-camp", "title": "Henry Slade to step up recovery at England Six Nations training camp", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:56:05 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Manu Tuilagi will also continue rehabilitation at camp<br />\u2022 Courtney Lawes rested and left out of 25-man training squad<p>Henry Slade will join up with his England teammates for the first time in this year\u2019s Six Nations as he steps up his recovery from an ankle problem.</p><p>Slade sustained the injury in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/21/leicester-exeter-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Exeter\u2019s 31-22 Premiership victory at Leicester</a> in mid-December, forcing him to miss the opening two rounds of the championship.

So hard has it been to find a ground for the sister team of the likely Premier League champions that they are resorting to a pitch which straddles the Welsh border, 26 miles from Anfield.\nTottenham, who play at National League Barnet\u2019s The Hive, have had one game postponed. As have West Ham, who play at their Rush Green training ground, Everton, who play at National League North Southport\u2019s ground, and Bristol City, who play at the Stoke Gifford stadium.\nThe players and fans deserve better. Yes, clubs have committed to token games at their main stadiums; all bar Manchester United, Arsenal and Birmingham have hosted league games at their primary stadiums this term. Those gestures deserve to be applauded and celebrated. But professionalism has accelerated the change and clubs are failing to keep up with the demands that that change brings. This is not about sharing main stadiums, yet. But it is time to question what is holding clubs back from properly investing in their women\u2019s teams.\nCommitting to funding drainage systems or pitch heaters at the ground their teams play on should be a no-brainier. Quality surfaces protect players. These are, on the whole, extremely wealthy clubs. That women\u2019s teams at present operate at a loss should not be an issue. The trickle of resources should be flowing more freely and that the tap is not being turned is a choice.\nBeing kind, perhaps they have been caught off guard by the demand. But these are not the only wrongs that need righting. Short-term contracts are still the norm, low wages are standard for the majority, conditions at many clubs lag way behind the provisions afforded the men\u2019s teams. It is not hard to at the very least share resources.\nThe former Manchester City manager Nick Cushing said as much in his final sit-down before his departure for New York City FC. \u201cIt was really simple for us \u2013 all it took was that the staff didn\u2019t have a negative perception of the girls in the women\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at maybe teams not training at their facility or playing on different grounds, I just think it\u2019s crazy. Not crazy, but I see how simple it was for us that I don\u2019t see why that doesn\u2019t happen at other clubs. We have found it so easy. It comes from the top.\n\u201cAll of the senior leadership team support our women\u2019s team, and believe in our women\u2019s team. I could say they loan us their expertise \u2013 but they don\u2019t, we are all part of the same football club.\u201d\nIn fact it must be harder to build anything close to that expertise from scratch as a separate enterprise than to find a way to integrate a women\u2019s set-up.\nClubs, though, aren\u2019t the only ones to have been caught napping. The Football Association has struggled to build the infrastructure around the league. Refereeing is at breaking point. A weekend does not pass without a litany of errors. It is no fault of the referees, who are not full-time, taking home a \u00a3120 match fee. The penalty awarded to Reading for a perceived handball by Katie Zelem, who had in fact cleanly headed the ball, went viral. All to often women\u2019s football clips go mainstream for the wrong reasons. The ambition of the FA is, eventually, professional referees but there is no timescale for that. There should be. A professional league requires professional officials. It is, again, not fair to the fans, players or, for that matter, the referees.\nFrom top to bottom the FA is struggling. The admission by the head of women\u2019s football, Sue Campbell, that it \n is staggering. \u201c[Partly] because we hadn\u2019t expected the amount of influx we\u2019ve had,\u201d she said. \u201cThe World Cup generated a vast number of girls and women coming back into the sport.\u201d\nIt is staggering because, by all accounts, the FA was caught out by the huge increase in interest following the 2015 World Cup and failed to capitalise on it. Every plan since, the core of its Gameplan for Growth, has been make sure those opportunities do not go to waste again. Yet here we are. The arguments for investment have been won, big attendances have been proven, TV audiences are strong, sponsors are on board; it is time clubs and the FA threw themselves in head first, instead of easing in slowly.\n The FA is discussing shifting next year\u2019s Community Shield from Wembley to sidestep a clash with the Women\u2019s European Championship finals. The curtain raiser to the Premier League season was played at Villa Park in 2012 during the Olympics.\n Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 10-1 in the Spanish Super Cup final. Marta Torrej\u00f3n scored four, Alexia Putellas and former Arsenal player Asisat Oshoala both scored twice, with the Norwegian Caroline Graham Hansen also on the scoresheet.\n Jess Fishlock has signed a new two-year contract with the NWSL side Reign FC. The 33-year-old is due to return soon from an ACL rupture last June. Fishlock won the Champions League on loan with Lyon last season.\n Kiera Walsh has signed a new three-year deal with Manchester City. The defensive midfielder, whom Nick Cushing labelled \u201cthe most intelligent player\u201d he has worked with, has made 142 appearances for City and won a domestic cup double last season.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/the-nfls-new-evil-empire-who-will-replace-the-patriots-as-league-supervillains": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/the-nfls-new-evil-empire-who-will-replace-the-patriots-as-league-supervillains", "title": "The NFL's new evil empire: who will replace the Patriots as league supervillains?", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:42:24 GMT", "summary": "<p>With New England\u2019s dynasty apparently reaching its endgame, the search if on for the team that fans love \u2013 or love to hate</p><p>There is just something about rooting <em>against</em> a team isn\u2019t there?

And it is those national villains who make ratings boom. Fans want to see their team go through \nteam. Neutrals want to cheer against them. So who will step up to take New England\u2019s place?\nOK, maybe we haven\u2019t seen the last of them. New England\u2019s run is coming to an end, but it\u2019s not over quite yet. There\u2019s a world in which \n and the Patriots enter rebuild mode. There\u2019s also a more likely one: the Patriots roll it back for another season, replenish a threadbare roster, and are one of the best teams in the league for another year or two, leading to even more frustration for the neutrals. \nThere\u2019s also a third path. The best way for the Patriots to recapture that sense of antagonism would be to rebuild and go again without Brady. The Patriots with Brady are dispiriting enough at this point, but at the age of 42, it\u2019s clear the end is in sight. If New England moved on from Brady and added a young, solid quarterback like, say, Teddy Bridgewater, and went on to win another division title and another AFC crown, the collective brains of \n fans from New Jersey to Los Angeles would explode.\nNo team is better poised to rip off a dynastic run than the Super Bowl champions. They have the best quarterback in the league, a smart front office, and a creative coach. The only issue for sports fans: they\u2019re too nice.\nThere was universal goodwill for head coach Andy Reid finally winning a Super Bowl. Patrick Mahomes is broadly acclaimed \n; he\u2019s having a Michael Jordan-like effect on the sport, \n of what we think is even possible.\nThe Chiefs have already survived scandal without too much national scorn. They\u2019ve been happy to add players \n in pursuit of winning. That, if you reside in Dallas, would have been a major deal. KC got a pass. Perhaps with increased scrutiny, those issues will form a bigger part of the national dialogue. But for now, the Reid-Mahomes halo has enveloped\neverything.\nAn on-field scandal is probably the only thing that could push the Chiefs close to Patriots territory. Maybe we find out Mahomes is truly an extraterrestrial. Or that his arm is literally bionic.\nThere has long been pushback against the self-proclamation of Dallas being \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d. If the Cowboys were ever good again, as in three-Super-Bowls-in-four-years good, they would ascend to a whole new stratosphere of resentment.\nTo generalize: sports fans do not like arrogance, earned or unearned. No NFL team, as a whole, has had a bigger collective ego than the Doug Pederson-era Eagles. There\u2019s a real smarty-pants vibe about the whole operation. Carson Wentz helps mask some of that, but from accusations that other teams don\u2019t have enough fun to the infamously corrosive fanbase, to the head coach\u2019s entire I\u2019ve-figured-this-football-thing-out attitude there\u2019s a pervasive smugness in Philly.\nThe national media, who often help set the X-against-the-world tone, were delighted by the Eagles\u2019 narrative when they won the Super Bowl in 2018. Nick Foles was such a great story that he overshadowed everything. The tenor will be different if the Eagles win big in 2020 or beyond.\nA wildcard team. The Bills are among a cast of fanbases right now with a disproportionate belief in their quarterback, Josh Allen. If you\u2019ve spent any time in the recesses of NFL Twitter you will know there\u2019s an ongoing feud between the so-called \u201cBills Mafia\u201d and the football nerds, those who study analytics and breakdown game film. The snark filling the conversation is second to none. Every throw is painstakingly analyzed by both sides and apportioned a career-defining meaning.\nIt is fantastic theatre. As Allen\u2019s career continues to bloom, he will continue to polarise. If his career hits lift-off, there will still be those in analysts chairs who refuse to relent on their pre-draft position. If Buffalo remains excellent in spite of Allen (and their coach is as good as it gets), then the analysts will continue to take a victory lap.\nCommissioner Roger Goodell, the league office, and the league\u2019s officials could take on this role, as they have during much of the past three seasons \u2013 the Deflategate scandal, the quality of officiating, the rule changes, the national anthem controversy, the concussion scandals. How you turn the incompetence of the governors of the game into ratings on game day is an issue, though it did help during the Replacement Ref days. A national audience \nto tune in to see if high school officials could really referee a professional game. Spoiler: they could not.\nIncompetence at the top level is good for media partners. It provides the likes of ESPN any number of segments, keeps the NFL, its biggest cash cow, as part of the daily conversation. But unlike the Patriots persona, it\u2019s hard for the league itself to turn that into TV ratings and profits.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/tiger-woods-premier-league-golf-ewan-murray": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/tiger-woods-premier-league-golf-ewan-murray", "title": "Cautious Tiger Woods holds key to success of Premier League Golf revolution | Ewan Murray", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:39:15 GMT", "summary": "As Woods prepares to host the Genesis Invitational, his response to Premier League Golf\u2019s plans faces intense scrutiny<p>This week\u2019s dreamy narrative is perfectly understandable.

I\u2019m out on tour telling him this story and he says, \u2018Well, you were in the way.\u2019\u201d And to think, Woods later teamed up with Steve Williams.\nWoods now hosts the event. This week\u2019s field includes nine of the world\u2019s top 10 and 19 of the leading 25. And yet, golf in early 2020 has been dominated by what may happen next.\nPremier League Golf\u2019s aspirations to \n and start again with the world\u2019s leading players is the supposed pipe dream that won\u2019t go away. Given the project has been years in the making, it was no shock to hear Woods confirm on Tuesday that he has been approached by golf\u2019s rebel alliance. Also of no surprise was that the 15-times major winner was circumspect on the proposal.\n\u201cMy team\u2019s been aware of it and we\u2019ve delved into the details of it and are trying to figure it out just like everyone else,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this road before with World \n Championships and other events being started, or other tours want to evolve and start. There\u2019s a lot of information that we\u2019re still looking at and whether it\u2019s reality or not, but just like everybody else, we\u2019re looking into it.\u201d\nWoods was given a subsequent chance to at least play down the scheme. While, smartly, not offering effusive praise he wasn\u2019t of a mind to be dismissive. \u201cJust like all events, you\u2019re trying to get the top players to play more collectively,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we instituted the World Golf Championships, because we were only getting together five times a year, the four majors and the Players and we wanted to showcase the top players on more than just those occasions. We came up with the World Golf Championships and we\u2019re meeting more often. And so this is a natural evolution, whether or not things like this are going to happen, but ideas like this are going to happen going forward, whether it\u2019s now or any other time in the future.\u201d\nIt is no exaggeration to point out Woods is crucial to this whole Premier League plan. When he speaks, cheque writers listen. Should he decide to back it, the consequences would be momentous: for the PGA Tour, for other players who would automatically follow his lead and for the new model itself. One man has the power to make or break it. But if you are Woods, who knows the Premier League is backed by phenomenal finance and that the PGA Tour will do everything within its power to swat this threat aside, you\u2019d be unlikely or unwise to deliver a final decision until absolutely necessary. If leading \n players generally have been empowered by the Premier League\u2019s lavish contracts, Woods is the king maker. It is perhaps harsh but also a brutal reality that the Premier League couldn\u2019t fly if Woods \u2013 and, to only a slightly lesser extent Rory McIlroy \u2013 remained in an alternative domain.\nThere are, as ever, fascinating subplots. This week at Riviera, players and their representatives are expected to hold their latest round of discussions relating to the Premier League. The individual so far most closely associated with the breakaway is Phil Mickelson, who had the Premier League\u2019s founders as pro-am partners during his recent trip to Saudi Arabia. It would be overplaying matters to suggest Woods, especially now, would automatically adopt the opposite approach to an individual with whom there was indifference \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 for years. Yet Woods, as astute off the course as he is on it, will be perfectly aware of the backdrop. Arnold Palmer catapulted the PGA Tour into fresh commercial territory in the 1960s, a scenario that has parallels with what Woods did decades later. It remains a long-shot that Woods would play the links renegade, particularly in this later phase of his career, when he could basically mirror Palmer as a PGA Tour icon who secured life-changing deals for other golfers. In return, it is wholly logical that Woods\u2019s commercial demands, just as the PGA Tour prepares to sign a new television deal, will be steep.\nIt feels inevitable that the top level golf landscape will change in the not-so distant future. The fairways will soon be paved with even more gold. Woods, in pursuit of tour and major records, will have a far bigger say than he has so far been credited with. Including, of course, by himself.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/talking-horses-tiger-roll-grand-national": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/talking-horses-tiger-roll-grand-national", "title": "Talking Horses: Tiger Roll 50-50 to run Grand National after weight decision | Greg Wood", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:01:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>The chances of the two-times winner of the Aintree showpiece going for a third victory remain in the balance</p><p>Tiger Roll negotiated another step on the path back to Aintree and an attempt to win a historic third Grand National on Tuesday, as the decision to compress his handicap mark by only 1lb prompted an expression of disappointment from his owners and a suggestion Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s 10-year-old remains \u201c50-50\u201d to run in the world\u2019s most famous steeplechase on 4 April.</p><p>Given some of the rumblings from the O\u2019Leary camp in the run-up to the publication of the National weights, that has to be seen as a positive.

Whatever his figure was, it surely was not \u201c1\u201d, yet for the moment at least, Tiger Roll is still a contender.\n\u201c[The weight] is a massive factor,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said the whole way through this horse is on a very unfair rating. He was raised 12lb last year for winning a cross-country race [at the Cheltenham Festival].\n\u201cThe last time this horse ran in a [standard] chase was two-and-a-half years ago and he pulled up off 150. He\u2019s obviously improved for the Grand National discipline and cross-country, but to rate this horse as a winner of a Gold Cup is ridiculous. Native River, a Gold Cup winner, hacked up last Saturday. He\u2019s been compressed 2lb and we have to give him 4lb. I see something very unfair there.\n\u201cThe decision is now in our hands whether we run or not. Tiger is invaluable to us and we have to look after him. Hopefully he comes through the Navan test [in Sunday\u2019s Boyne Hurdle] and then goes on to Cheltenham and hopefully shows us more there. Then we\u2019ll decide, but at the moment, it\u2019s 50-50. The Betway Bowl [the day before the National] is definitely coming into calculations now.\u201d\nTiger Roll\u2019s owners are a little put out, in other words but a long way from deciding to take their bat home. O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments are also a useful reminder that while what could be the biggest racing story for half a century is still a possibility, there are several more obstacles to negotiate before a third tilt at the National is even a shade of odds-on.\nThere will be no jumping in Britain until Thursday at the earliest after Hereford succumbed to the elements and while \nand \n both have solid chances on the card at \n this evening and \nlooks good for a quickfire double at \n, it is also a good moment to sift through the Grand National odds now that we know the weights.\nIt is 6-1 Tiger Roll and 16-1 bar now that the market has settled down, while Paddy Power take a rather more positive view of the chance that Tiger Roll will line up for the race than Eddie O\u2019Leary, the owner\u2019s brother and racing manager. While O\u2019Leary insists that it is 50-50, the bookie goes 4-11 that Tiger Roll lines up and 15-8 that he does not, though anyone actually backing \u201cno\u201d should take a long look at themselves.\nThere are, though, plenty of reasons why Tiger Roll could be missing from the field on 4 April regardless of the arguments about his handicap mark, and while there will be a rush of money to support him if he does line up, there will still be plenty of bookies (and Betfair players) happy to take him on. He went off at 4-1 last year, and there is no obvious reason why he might be a great deal shorter this time.\nSeveral of the names on the current list will be significantly shorter come the day, however, and the urge to spread a little each-way money around is impossible to resist. Native River has been given a real chance by the handicapper but is hard to back with any confidence at this stage when he seemingly has a tough assignment in the Gold Cup in front of him. He is an obvious second- or third-favourite if he lines up, but one that makes more appeal as a possible springer is Yala Enki (33-1), third home in the last two Welsh Nationals and a potential ride for Bryony Frost.\nHe is 5lb better off at the weights with the winner, Potters Corner, having been beaten less than three lengths and is clearly tough as nails, as he put up one of the best performances of his career to win at Taunton over three-and-a-half miles less than a month after running at Chepstow. The Irish Grand National has also been a rich source of live contenders for Aintree in recent years and last year\u2019s winner, Burrows Saint, is prominent in the early betting.\nHe could well start favourite if Tiger Roll does not run, which would make his current price of 16-1 look very healthy, but the Fairyhouse form has another representative, also from the Mullins yard, in third-home Acapella Bourgeois. His jumping was a little mixed in the Thyestes Chase last time but he is 10lb better off with Burrows Saint having finished seven lengths behind at Fairyhouse and worth a small interest at 66-1.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/11/six-nations-casual-crowd-pay-tv-cvc-deal": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/11/six-nations-casual-crowd-pay-tv-cvc-deal", "title": "Six Nations must look after its casual crowd who may not pay to watch it | Andy Bull", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:37:15 GMT", "summary": "The Six Nations and the private equity firm CVC\u2019s impending deal is threatening to take some games off free-to-air TV, and that could be a dangerous move<p>In August 1990 a retired French nuclear physicist called Andr\u00e9 Gardes armed himself with a semi\u2011automatic weapon and launched a one-man invasion of Sark.

Until, as the train pulled into the first stop, the public address told them what was ahead.\nThe guard spoke about the weather forecast and said anyone who wanted to come back to London the next day should think again because the company would be running an emergency service. There would be only five trains all day and they would take around 10 hours each. The advice was not to travel at all. Anyone who wanted to cut their losses should get off at the next station and talk to the staff about travelling back to London. The lads decided to press on to York, so they\u2019d have time to talk it all through. But you could tell by the way one of them was humming and hawing that he, at least, had already decided what to do.\nHe couldn\u2019t stay in Edinburgh another day, he explained, because he absolutely had to be back in the office on Monday. He didn\u2019t fancy their chances of finding a cheap seat on a flight, didn\u2019t know if the airports would be closed anyway, and, as for the train, well, the way the guard was talking made the journey sound like a fate from the Book of Revelations. With their enthusiasm now extinguished they put in a sheepish call to the people they were supposed to be meeting, made their excuses, and got off at the next stop. They must have made it London in plenty of time for kick-off, if they bothered watching.\nThere was salutary lesson in all this for the people running the Six Nations, who are, even now, in the throes of their \n. It wants to buy a 15% stake in the tournament, to go with its 27% chunks of the Premiership and Pro14. The deal is turning on whether or not the Six Nations will let CVC take live coverage off free\u2011to-air TV, away from ITV and the BBC. My colleague Paul Rees \n that there is talk of a \u201chybrid deal\u201d in which one of the three games in each round of matches would be put behind a paywall. I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be Italy\u2019s.\nCVC did a similar thing when it took control of Formula One. When CVC got into the sport, the BBC showed every race, then started showing half the races, and then, in the end, showed no races at all. It was a similar story in many other countries.\nCVC\u2019s motivations are crystal clear. The only thing it is interested in is how much profit it can extract from its investment. Just like \n when CVC finally sold up its stake in his sport, the company is \u201cpretty upfront\u201d about what it does. \u201cThey buy and sell companies looking to make a profit.\u201d They made about 450% on their investment in Formula One, partly by loading the sport with debt so they could pay themselves dividends. At the same time they managed to reduce its global audience by about a third. The company which bought them out, Liberty Media, is, unsurprisingly, desperate to get Formula One back on free-to-air.\nRight now the \n is the single biggest asset European rugby has, because it is the only event, outside of the World Cup, that reaches a mainstream audience of millions of casual fans. The commentator Brian Moore touched on this the other day, when he was being criticised for the way he was covering matches. \u201cTo those saying my analysis is old-fashioned \u2013 it isn\u2019t but it is simple,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cKnow why? Because out of an audience of 7m-8m, all but 1m know very little about rugby and they need simple explanations. If the choice is boring supposed experts and informing them; I choose them.\u201d\nTheir commitment to the sport is a lot more tenuous than some of the people who run the sport seem to imagine. They won\u2019t follow it to on to pay TV, any more than they will put up with a 10-hour trip back from a match. Because much as all of the rest of us on that train wanted to think the two men ended up regretting their decision, you have to really love rugby to think the match \u2013 which we might euphemistically call \u201cone for the connoisseurs\u201d \u2013 was worth spending half your weekend squatting on the train floor by the toilet door. And though you didn\u2019t hear any of them say it, there were likely one or two, or even quite a few, people on that train back wishing they had cut out too.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/uk-sport-launches-review-into-uk-athletics": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/uk-sport-launches-review-into-uk-athletics", "title": "UK Sport launches review into ailing UK Athletics amid \u2018major concerns\u2019", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:04:37 GMT", "summary": "\u2022 Review aims to make athletics governing body \u2018fit for the future\u2019<br />\u2022 UK Athletics in disarray following a series of crises and scandals<p>UK Sport has begun an unprecedented comprehensive review into UK Athletics after admitting it had \u201cmajor concerns\u201d following a series of crises, scandals and poor decisions that have plunged the organisation into disarray.</p><p>The independent review, which comes only five months before the Tokyo Olympics, will examine \u201cthe strategy, leadership, governance, operation, culture and connectivity of UK Athletics\u201d to ensure it is \u201cfit for the future\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/uk-sport-launches-review-into-uk-athletics\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "UK Sport has begun an unprecedented comprehensive review into UK \n after admitting it had \u201cmajor concerns\u201d following a series of crises, scandals and poor decisions that have plunged the organisation into disarray.\nThe independent review, which comes only five months before the Tokyo Olympics, will examine \u201cthe strategy, leadership, governance, operation, culture and connectivity of UK Athletics\u201d to ensure it is \u201cfit for the future\u201d.\n, which has funded UK Athletics to the tune of \u00a327m since 2017 in its role overseeing all Olympic sports in Britain and Northern Ireland, has taken the step despite two independent reviews already having been recently commissioned to look at the actions of the organisation.\nIn recent months UK Athletics lost its chief executive Zara Hyde Peters before she started in the role when she stepped down after failing to disclose to her local athletics club her husband\u2019s \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with a 15-year-old girl.

Both teams then went to their dressing rooms and the game was called off a few minutes later tied at 1-1. Players from both teams met for hugs and well-wishes after changing out of their gear. The game will be made up at a later date.\nBouwmeester is in his 17th NHL season and has for that time been known for his strong skating and conditioning. He helped the Blues to win the Stanley Cup last season and won an Olympic gold medal with Canada in 2014. He was skating in his 57th game this season, the 1,241st of his \n career. He skated 1:20 in his last shift before collapsing and logged 5:34 of ice time in the game.\nThe last player to collapse on an NHL bench was the Dallas forward Rich Peverley in 2014. Peverley had an irregular heartbeat, and the quick response of emergency officials made sure he was OK.\nThe NHL has pages of emergency medical standards that spell out in specific detail that at least two doctors must be in attendance for every game and one must be within 50 feet of the bench. A defibrillator, which was used when Detroit\u2019s Jiri Fischer collapsed in 2005, must be available, along with a triage room and ambulances.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/f1-teams-2021-deal-negotiations": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/f1-teams-2021-deal-negotiations", "title": "Ferrari unveil new car with F1 teams set to agree more equitable revenue deal", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 20:27:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2022 Sebastian Vettel \u2018can\u2019t wait to drive\u2019 new SF1000<br>\u2022 New collective deal should boost smaller teams</p><p>Ferrari have unveiled the SF1000, the new Formula One car they hope will end Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton\u2019s dominance on the track.</p><p>The new machine was unveiled at the Teatro Municipale Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy.

Sebastian Vettel, a four-time world champion still waiting for his first title with Ferrari, said \u201cI like it a lot. I can\u2019t wait to drive it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is impossible to predict what will happen but I see a lot of hours that went into the car,\u201d Vettel added. \u201cI think it is a step forward and I hope it feels like that to drive. Part of the adventure is we have to be patient and we have to wait.\u201d\nThe SF1000 will continue to be developed in advance of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 15 March. Fans will get their first look at the new car in action when testing begins in Barcelona on 19 February.\nLast season\u2019s model, the SF90, struggled with aerodynamic issues as the wait for a Ferrari world champion continued. Kimi Raikkonen was the last driver to bring the title back to Monza, 13 years ago. The team will continue with Vettel and Charles Leclerc as drivers this season.\nFerrari\u2019s launch comes amid progress towards a new agreement between F1, the FIA and the 10 current teams. The current Concorde agreement concludes at the end of this year, but senior team members are confident that a new deal will be struck.\nNegotiations are continuing but the McLaren chief executive officer, Zak Brown, considers that one of the most contested problems \u2013 the fairer distribution of revenue \u2013 has been addressed, and it is likely all 10 teams will stay on the grid for the 2021 season.\nThe Concorde agreement is the contract between the commercial rights holder, now Liberty Media, the sports governing body, the FIA, and the competitors. Included within the new deal, as well as technical and sporting regulations, governance and a budget cap, is the distribution of just over $1bn (\u00a3772m) to the teams and engine manufacturers. Wide variances in payments based on the last Concorde agreement have long been a bone of contention.\nBrown, who will oversee the launch of this season\u2019s McLaren, the MCL35, on Thursday, believes the new agreement and its new revenue deal will be accepted. \u201cI think it will go through, I would be surprised if all 10 teams on the grid this year are not on the grid next year,\u201d he said.\nThe revenue is distributed among teams via a range of payments. Each receive approximately $35m (\u00a327m) for taking part, then a secondary sum based on their championship position in the previous season. Beyond this, however, there is a series of supplementary payments.\nFerrari receive a longstanding team fee of what is understood to be around $73m. Four teams \u2013 Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull and McLaren \u2013 also receive a constructors\u2019 championship bonus of between $30m and $40m. Further additional payments are also made to Red Bull, Mercedes ($35m each) and Williams ($10m).\nThe revenue differential between the top teams and the midfield can be of almost a factor of four. Liberty\u2019s new structure is believed to address these inequities in an attempt to ensure every team are financially viable and better able to compete with far greater weighting geared to performance.\n\u201cI believe everyone is going to accept the revenue distribution as proposed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt is a much more balanced. Special payments, other than Ferrari\u2019s which is reduced, are gone and the gap between the best paid and least paid has closed up.\u201d\nFerrari will receive a historical payment but it is understood it must be taken in the form of profit rather than toward funding their F1 activities. Equally, teams will still be recognised for longevity but must continue to perform to maintain a greater share of the pot.\nBrown suggests it will represent almost a financial form of relegation or promotion. \u201cThey have come up with a clever way to address historical performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel quite right that a new team should be on the same financial playing field as McLaren or Red Bull.\u201d\nUnder the new system Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari will experience the biggest fall in income, with Brown believing McLaren would remain approximately at the same level. However with a budget cap of $175m set to be imposed the flatter distribution rate will not impact as heavily on the big teams. It will bring the rest of the grid much closer to them in funding and, it is hoped, their ability to compete.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/amar-virdi-british-asians-system-cricket": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/amar-virdi-british-asians-system-cricket", "title": "The Spin | Amar Virdi: 'British Asians can make it, it's knowing how the system works'", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 15:01:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>A third of recreational cricket is played by British Asians but comparatively few make it to the professional game.

It is not just the patka and beard that made this young Sikh so eye-catching; this is a finger spinner who gives the ball a proper rip.\nBut the strains of that breakout campaign led to a stress issue in his lower back and while it did clear up over the winter, Virdi was then omitted for the first nine matches of last season because his overall fitness had fallen below an acceptable standard.\nAlec Stewart, Surrey\u2019s director of cricket, spoke of a player in need of some \u201ctough love\u201d and after a spell with Darren Veness, the club\u2019s hulking great fitness coach, a more slimline Virdi returned in July with a bang, snaring 14 Nottinghamshire wickets in a spin-fest at Trent Bridge.\nThough most eyes at the time were on the mind-bending World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, and his season was more quiet thereafter, it was the type of performance that highlighted why Virdi has been talked about as a future international since he first started playing first-XI club cricket aged 13.\nNow in the Lions set-up for the three-match tour that begins against a \n Australia XI in Hobart on Saturday \u2013 albeit sitting behind Dom Bess, who after an encouraging recall in South Africa bounces on to Sri Lanka \u2013 Virdi is determined to show the coaches how much he wants truly wants it.\n\u201cLast season was, well, different. I was pretty sad and upset at missing games after the year we had before but I think good comes from bad,\u201d Virdi told the Guardian before his departure for Australia, spinning an apple in his hand by force of habit.\n\u201cI know I have to be in the best possible shape. I don\u2019t want to let my teammates down by not being able to make a catch or bowl 50 overs in a match.\n\u201cSo yes, it hurt. But I want to play Test cricket and be in the best shape come the fifth day to win the game for my team. I\u2019ve been training hard and watching what I eat. It\u2019s been a case of getting into the mindset of a professional athlete. I want to make sure that it\u2019s not spoken about again.\u201d\nThe Lions tour follows Virdi\u2019s attendance at a pre-Christmas spin camp in Mumbai, where along with Bess and Mason Crane, he worked with Rangana Herath. That experience opened his eyes to the smarts required on the subcontinent, chiefly the varied use of the crease and release points that brought the Sri Lankan great 433 Test victims.\nVirdi is rightly patient at present, knowing he remains raw, but also serious about his Test ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will come.\u201d he says. If so, he would be only the third Sikh to do so with England after Monty Panesar and Ravi Bopara. It was, however, two other cricketers who fired his imagination as a child.\nVirdi said: \u201cSaqlain Mushtaq was a role model for me and I have been lucky to work with him for the past six to eight years with Surrey and England. And I loved watching Harbhajan Singh as a kid. It was his charisma and his energy \u2013 and the fact he ragged it square.\n\u201cAnd it was also his style. He was almost like someone doing a painting \u2013 it was like artwork, the way his arms glided. It looked effortless but with so much control.\n\u201cAnd there was also his relatability. As a young Sikh boy, there was Monty Panesar in England but not many others. So it was exciting for me, seeing a guy who looks like me bowling off-spin in Test cricket.\u201d\nVirdi describes himself as \u201cblessed\u2019 to be born into the Sikh faith and speaks of his appearance as a \u201cuniform\u201d that comes with responsibility. With this comes a desire to show other Sikhs, and the British Asian community that makes up a third of the recreational game, they too can make it.\nThe son of immigrants from East Africa \u2013 his father, Raj, came to the UK from Kenya to study, while his mother, Harmeet, was part of the Indian exodus from Idi Amin\u2019s regime in Uganda \u2013 Virdi first turned out for Indian Gymkhana in Osterley before moving to Sunbury CC at the start of his teens.\nThat type of switch, instigated by his father, was one that Virdi believes other British Asians must be open to. Though he turned down private school scholarships to stay at the state-funded Guru Nanak Sikh Academy near his family home in Hounslow, Virdi fancies the move from a predominantly Asian club to one with more established county connections was key to being spotted.\nVirdi said: \u201cIn terms of the Asian conundrum \u2013 or whatever it is called these days \u2013 there needs to be more education for parents, I think. We have seen Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Monty Panesar, Ravi Bopara \u2013 it\u2019s not that British Asians can\u2019t make it through, it\u2019s more knowing how the system works.\n\u201cMy dad was very switched on and could see what I needed to do. Sunbury was a club that Middlesex and Surrey both look at and they have had 10 or so professionals come through. Sometimes guys are reluctant to leave Asian clubs. And it can be daunting.\u201d\nVirdi\u2019s mature outlook likely comes from being immersed in adult cricket so young, such that he is not a cricketer who looks for excuses even when, for example, his trade as a specialist first-class spinner must be performed in the spring then autumn competition that is the County Championship.\nHe added: \u201cPitches don\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve played games at the start of the season where it has spun. This tour of Australia with the Lions, they say off-spinners don\u2019t thrive there but I\u2019m looking forward to some hard surfaces and bounce. You are always learning, you\u2019re never the finished article.\n\u201cThe journey can take time or be fast. I just want to be ready when it comes and show the world what I can do.\u201d\n \n.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/david-squires-on-the-trouble-with-the-premier-league-winter-break": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/david-squires-on-the-trouble-with-the-premier-league-winter-break", "title": "David Squires on \u2026 the trouble with the Premier League winter break", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:03:17 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our cartoonist on how footballers and managers in the English top flight are struggling to deal with having some time off</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/david-squires/products/the-trouble-with-the-premier-league-winter-break\">Buy a copy of this cartoon from our print shop</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/david-squires-on\">Take a look through David\u2019s archive of cartoon</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/david-squires-on-the-trouble-with-the-premier-league-winter-break\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": ""}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/murrayfield-atmosphere-rising-noise-bile-spite-rugby-union-six-nations-england-scotland": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/murrayfield-atmosphere-rising-noise-bile-spite-rugby-union-six-nations-england-scotland", "title": "Murrayfield atmosphere reflected rising noise, bile and spite in rugby union | Robert Kitson", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 10:00:00 GMT", "summary": "<p>Six Nations sees respect jettisoned for ill-feeling, as evidenced by Eddie Jones\u2019s name-calling and fans jeering goalkickers</p><p>Few sports tread the fine line between love and hate as precariously as rugby union.

The code used to be simple: regardless of the intensity of the contest, be respectful to the referee, your opponents and the game itself. Increasingly, though, rugby is drifting in the opposite direction. Abusing the goalkickers, gesticulating at officials, booing players from a rival nation off the bus and blaming the media have become an all-too familiar part of the \n backdrop.\nIt would be simple to file all this away under the heading \u201cmodern life\u201d and criticise keyboard warriors on Twitter for helping to coarsen the atmosphere around top-level rugby \u2013 simple but a shade too convenient because it is about time rugby woke up to the self-inflicted damage being done by some within the game who should know better, not least coaches who overlook the link between their pre-match rhetoric and deteriorating relationships elsewhere.\nWhen Eddie Jones talked about \n and \n one can be sure some of his employers at the Rugby Football Union were among those rolling their eyes. It helps to fuel the kind of atmosphere that, along with the wind and the rain, made its presence keenly felt at Murrayfield on Saturday when England were jeered on arrival and their captain Owen Farrell was booed when he kicked for goal.\nFriendly rivalry is fine; centuries of history cannot be entirely rewritten, after all. But as the former Scotland international Peter Brown wrote in a thundering letter to the Times last week: \u201cHate is for terrorists. Not rugby players.\u201d\nDisliking someone based purely on their nationality is the most blinkered of traits; such intolerance is nothing to shout about. Stranded in Edinburgh by the weather over the weekend three of us were scooped up by two extremely kind rescuers, a Dutchman living in Ascot and a South African resident in Singapore. A seven-hour shared car odyssey and hundreds of miles of rugby chat later, it felt as if we had known each other for years.\nMaybe it would help if more players were also encouraged to see the benefits of engaging with the media, to look past the occasional wince-inducing headline and recognise the opportunity to project themselves, both as athletes and as human beings. It might give some of them a more rounded perspective.\nThere is a massive amount to admire about Ellis Genge: his talent, his dynamism, his honesty and his refusal to be constrained by the perceptions of others. But when he dismisses \n \n only to say nicer things \n, he is straying on to trickier terrain. Does that mean only he, Ellis, can tell it like it is? Is he saying the former internationals who were critical of the Parisian performance know nothing? Honesty at the top level is a two-way street.\nAt times it is easier said than done. One minute players are expected to be singing their hearts out during the anthems, the next to be completely calm. Or to smash their opponent into the middle of next week before getting up and calling the referee \u201csir\u201d. It must occasionally be galling to listen to a coach or captain whose back you were protecting until recently delivering home truths from a well-remunerated pundit\u2019s chair.\nMaybe there are just too many podcasts, with too many babbling voices competing to be the noisiest, most controversial or the most indiscreet. Either way, there is way too much impatience and intolerance swilling around which, in turn, threatens the umbilical cord linking the game with its public.\nJohnny Sexton is surely destined to become the best referee in the world, so often does he lecture those mere mortals currently trying to do the job. Jones writes disparagingly in his autobiography about the media \u201clunch club\u201d and their \u201castounding vanity\u201d without bothering to name names. Finn Russell savages Gregor Townsend\u2019s coaching regime mid-tournament, in apparent retribution for the lack of understanding he believes has been shown towards him. Can they both be right? It is that same blurry fine line again, this time between free speech and fair comment.\nNo one wants rugby to become one big ocean of blandness. Then again, it is already tough enough not to require unnecessary bile and spite. Nor is it about people trying to cling to some absurd notion of moral superiority over other sports, as if that were ever true. It is more about people recognising they do not reside in some kind of bubble. Silence for kickers is fine but not if they take forever lining it up. If you make disparaging remarks about a rival nation at a press conference, do not then complain when someone abuses you in the street or on a train.\nThe presence of the remarkable Doddie Weir at Murrayfield was a timely reminder of what a real rugby ambassador looks like. If only out of respect for inspiring people like him, the trash talking has to stop.\nOn the touchline at the U20 international between Scotland and England at Myreside on Friday night, everyone was saying the same thing. \u201cLook at the size of them,\u201d muttered the spectator behind me. \u201cThey\u2019re all absolutely massive.\u201d He was not just talking about England, who traditionally love a big forward at age-group level, but the home side, too. Watching Scotland\u2019s 6ft 2in tall fly-half, Nathan Chamberlain, up against England\u2019s full-back Freddie Steward, who stands over 6ft 4in and weighs 101kg (15st 9lb), was to suspect Eddie Jones may be correct to predict the sport will become more and more about power. It will become an infinitely poorer game if smaller playmakers are all but squeezed out.\nHere\u2019s hoping that this year\u2019s Women\u2019s Six Nations is remembered for more than just one \n and a lack of hot showers for Wales\u2019s frozen players in Ireland at the weekend. The good news is that the media rights for the women\u2019s games are to be sold under the same umbrella as the men\u2019s international schedule from next season, hopefully ensuring better scheduling, more visibility and greater remuneration for those involved. It will be fascinating to see how far the women\u2019s game advances between now and 2030. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/premier-league-clubs-australian-bank-macquarie-loans-tv-earnings": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/premier-league-clubs-australian-bank-macquarie-loans-tv-earnings", "title": "Why Premier League clubs are turning to an Australian bank in big numbers", "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 15:30:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>Teams in England\u2019s top two divisions are taking sizeable loans from Macquarie, at times mortgaged against future TV earnings</p><p>It was once <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/enter-the-vampire-kangaroo-rs62j9f2lc3\" title=\"\">dubbed the \u201cvampire kangaroo\u201d</a> and accused of \u201cfeasting on Britain\u2019s creaking infrastructure\u201d after investing in companies such as Thames Water and avoiding tax through a legal but controversial web of subsidiaries in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.

Since 2013, and encouraged by increased transparency in the game following the introduction of Uefa\u2019s financial fair play regulations, Macquarie estimates that it has completed more than $1.5bn in loans across Europe\u2019s major leagues, specialising in \u201ctransfer financing\u201d and \u201cmedia and sponsorship rights monetisation\u201d.\nAny club that uses such a facility must register a charge \u2013 security against the loan \u2013 with Companies House. The latest arrangement with Wolves, registered on 13 January, extends their \u00a350m lending facility until March 2021.\nThat means part of the credits of future TV income \u2013 worth \u00a3130m a season under the latest deal \u2013 have been transferred to Macquarie in exchange for their capital, although it is not known how much interest Wolves will pay to receive the money in advance.\nThe latest charge registered by Leicester was also added on 13 January. But rather than being evidence of more borrowing, this was because the arrangement has to be ratified every six months by the \n, which distributes TV rights from its central fund.\n\u201cEvery time [a club] renew, effectively they are extending the length of the overdraft and it means that Macquarie are entitled to the money from the next tranche of TV money from the Premier League,\u201d explains Kieran Maguire, who is a senior teacher at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School and specialises in football finance. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of clubs doing this and it makes a lot of sense. The broadcasting payments are made three or four times a year but you\u2019ve got all of the overheads going out in between, including the wage bill.\n\u201cI understand that a lot of banks are providing similar services but, because they are not formally registering a charge, we don\u2019t see the documentation because nothing is going through Companies House. It\u2019s a risk in the same way that if you take out a mortgage and it helps from a cash flow point of view.\u201d\nLeicester\u2019s relationship with Macquarie began in October 2018, three months after Riyad Mahrez joined Manchester City for \u00a360m. As is common in most modern transfers, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side were due to pay in instalments, with the final \u00a336m due in two tranches by the end of July this year. Enter Macquarie. In exchange for the \u00a336m, Leicester agreed a secured borrowing facility that means the transfer fee will be paid to Macquarie instead.\nA similar service is \n, the company which has financed several multimillion transfer deals including Antoine Griezmann\u2019s \u20ac120m move to Barcelona and that of his replacement at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix.\nKnown in the business as \u201ctransfer factoring\u201d, it has become an increasingly popular way of raising finance quickly to enable clubs to compete in the transfer market and deal with spiralling wage bills. But with interest rates estimated to be at least 6%-7%, the risks are clear.\nLeicester\u2019s latest loan does not specify how much they can borrow from Macquarie, although it is the sixth time they have entered an arrangement with the lender.\nThe second \u2013 made in December 2018 \u2013 has been satisfied but was \n to be larger than the first arrangement over Mahrez and had been earmarked to help fund a new training ground and expand the King Power Stadium.\nTwo more are outstanding, although Maguire does not believe there is any evidence of financial difficulties at a club on course to qualify for the Champions League.\n\u201cWhat will often happen is that you might have separate charge arrangements over separate assets belonging to the club,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could be something as simple as that \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything Machiavellian in it.\u201d\nMacquarie says it is selective about who it does business with. It has been marketing its services directly to English clubs and many have jumped at the opportunity to improve their cash flow.\nSouthampton, who previously borrowed money from the \n that came under scrutiny from MPs in 2016, have a long-established relationship, having first taken out a loan in November 2016 secured against future TV rights. They have since returned annually and filed a new charge in the summer.\nMeanwhile, Macquarie purchased half of the credits owed to \n from the \u00a345m transfer of Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United last summer. Courtesy of the bank, Bournemouth received the \u00a312m then owed by Aston Villa for the England defender Tyrone Mings 12 months earlier than scheduled. Even Craig Dawson\u2019s \u00a35.5m move to Watford in the summer led West Brom to take out a \u00a32,395,300 loan, corresponding to the amount of the fee they were due to be paid in June 2021.\nSwansea\u2019s first loan with Macquarie after they sold the Spanish midfielder Roque Mesa in June 2018 was satisfied last week, although the \n club have two outstanding arrangements made almost 18 months ago. High-interest repayments from what Maguire describes as \u201cboutique lenders\u201d have become a feature of the multibillion-pound industry that is modern football but he does not think it necessarily spells trouble.\n\u201cAny form of borrowing comes with an element of risk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut fans might also take the view that if the club borrows and invests that on the pitch with players then that is likely to reduce the risk of relegation, therefore assuring the club of another year\u2019s TV money. It\u2019s a double-edged sword.\n\u201cIn an ideal world I think most fans would prefer that the club owner takes on the form of a benevolent dictator and gifts the club the money through an interest-free loan, like Farhad Moshiri has done at Everton. But they are always much harder to find.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/12/liverpool-aim-to-start-60m-anfield-road-redevelopment-this-year-completion-summer-2022": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/12/liverpool-aim-to-start-60m-anfield-road-redevelopment-this-year-completion-summer-2022", "title": "Liverpool aim to start \u00a360m Anfield Road redevelopment this year", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:07:52 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Completion of project scheduled for summer of 2022</li><li>Second stage of public consultation began on Wednesday</li></ul><p>Liverpool hope to begin work on their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/liverpool-anfield-expansion-plans-capacity\" title=\"\">\u00a360m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/29/liverpool-anfield-expansion-plans-capacity\" title=\"\"> Anfield Road redevelopment</a> by the end of the year, with completion scheduled for the summer of 2022.</p><p>The second stage of public consultation, reflecting small changes to the original proposals \u2013 the most significant being the rerouting of the road rather than permanent closure \u2013 began on Wednesday.

While officers in normal police uniform are engaging more with supporters following the change of policy, the force still deploys officers in protective gear, with Nato helmets and batons, depending on the assessed likelihood of disorder.\nThe Football League is funding research this season into project \u201cEnable,\u201d which \n and has argued that the deployment of officers equipped for riot or disorder control is often excessive and counterproductive.\nSouth \n police\u2019s methods are subject to more scrutiny than some other forces owing to historical scandals involving the force and the fact the deputy chief constable, Mark Roberts, is the national lead officer in the UK Football Policing Unit, an influential part of the Home Office.\nThe force\u2019s modern football policing was subjected to serious public criticism following problems at the derby between Wednesday and United at Hillsborough last March. Some supporters complained they were held in a crush outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles as they left the ground after the match, and that police officers had indiscriminately hit people with batons. \n rated the policing as on average 1.9 out of 10, and described the policing as \u201catrocious,\u201d \u201cirresponsible,\u201d and \u201cintimidating and unapproachable\u201d.\nLouise Haigh, the MP for \n Heeley and Labour\u2019s shadow minister for policing and crime, said of Saturday\u2019s incident: \u201cThis event has caused deep public concern and underlines a sense among fans that matchdays are becoming increasingly hostile.

In the second half Leeds were totally dominant, Brentford\u2019s BMW \u2013 Benrahma, Bryan Mbeumo, Ollie Watkins \u2013 was on bricks. But despite two or three good chances the visitors were unable to convert their superiority into points.\nMarcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager, took his time in delivering his post-match remarks and barely looked up while he did so. \u201cThe players left everything on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe defended well. It was difficult to attack for us even though we attacked all the match. But we controlled their attackers well, we managed the ball well and this is not easy against a team like Brentford who have great players.\u201d\nBielsa insisted his team played better at the weekend in their \n but Leeds were focused and determined from the off, only to fall behind. Casilla may have once worn the jersey of Real Madrid but he is looking like a real liability. Recent setbacks have been marked by Casilla errors and there was another, the Spaniard completely misreading a gentle backpass from Cooper, letting the ball run under a foot for Benrahma to score. Casilla pounded the turf in anger but, still, his teammates came over to help him up. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kiko needs my words, I always support him with decisions,\u201d Bielsa said before acknowledging the collective support offered by the team. \u201cI know the human quality of the players of Leeds, I think Casilla will receive support from his teammates and not lose confidence.\u201d\nUp until their goal, Brentford had struggled. Their manager Thomas Frank confessed that while his team knew all about the intensity of the Leeds press (the Dane unpicked its characteristics in some detail) there was a difference between understanding it and being able to counter it. But after Benrahma\u2019s opener they had their best spell and the flicks, tricks and clever movement started to come back into their play. Just past the half-hour and Luke Ayling did brilliantly to block a Benrahma effort after a cute dummy from Watkins.\nLeeds were down but they were not out and by half-time they were level. Their goal came from a corner, taken by Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez. His delivery was accurate, coming down near the penalty spot into a crowd of players. Raya came to claim and got there but amid the bustle the goalkeeper was unable to keep his grip. The ball spilled and there was Cooper, the captain, to poke home into the roof of the net. He jogged back to the halfway line alone before celebrating with the raucous travelling fans.\nLeeds emerged for the second half with the same attitude but also with more belief. They had the measure of Brentford\u2019s midfield and were sharp on the counter. Patrick Bamford should have scored within seven minutes of the restart but badly misjudged a free header from an Ayling cross.\nIn the 58th minute, Bamford\u2019s good play in a tight space released H\u00e9lder Costa down the right but after an interchange with Mateusz Klich, the winger could hit only a tame shot. A third chance came just after the hour but again Bamford\u2019s connection left a lot to be desired as Jack Harrison picked him out for a shot on the edge of the box.\nThe longer the game went on the more it became clear the only thing standing between Leeds and victory was themselves. And so it seemed a positive sign when Jean-K\u00e9vin Augustin came on for Bamford with 15 minutes to go.\nBut the clock ran down without the RB Leipzig loanee, making only his second appearance, getting a proper chance. Hern\u00e1ndez did at least test Raya in the dying stages but this time he was up to the task and tipped the Spaniard\u2019s volley over.\n\u201cI think it was a fair result,\u201d said Frank, whose team remain two points and two places behind Leeds in fourth. He had suggested before the match that Leeds \u201cfeared\u201d his team but rolled back on the words once events had superseded them. \u201cI don\u2019t do mind games,\u201d he said. \u201cI admire Bielsa, I think Leeds are one of the best teams [in the division].\n\u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t fear us but they knew it would be a difficult match. There\u2019s a reason why we are where we are in the table and they definitely respect us.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/bbc-womens-footballer-of-year-award-shortlist": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/12/bbc-womens-footballer-of-year-award-shortlist", "title": "Sam Kerr and Lucy Bronze shortlisted for BBC women\u2019s footballer of the year", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 07:00:26 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>England defender joins Matildas captain on list<br></li><li>Miedema, Ertz and Rapinoe also in running for honour<br></li></ul><p>New Chelsea recruit Sam Kerr is in the running to scoop another individual accolade after being named on a five-woman shortlist for the BBC\u2019s prestigious women\u2019s footballer of the year award.

Bloody hell!\u201d exclaims Pajtim Kasami as he watches back his volley for Fulham against \n six years later. It is the goal the Switzerland international\u2019s time in England will be remembered for.\nFull-back Sascha Riether was situated just inside his own half when he saw Kasami make his run. Riether chipped the ball to the edge of the box, where the midfielder controlled it with his chest before immediately volleying, while still on the move, over Juli\u00e1n Speroni and into the top corner from the right-hand side of the area. It was Van Basten-esque in terms of its execution \u2013 with his weaker foot \u2013 but with the added joy of intelligence to sprint into position and control it perfectly.\n\u201cEverything happened so fast. It\u2019s a goal of instinct; you score it and don\u2019t think about it too much but after you realise: \u2018Wow, what a goal\u2019,\u201d Kasami explains. \u201cAt the moment you don\u2019t really realise what a goal you have scored. It was a perfect goal; with the pass, the run I made, the way I controlled it and then hit it with my weaker foot, everything was on point.\u201d\nKasami had brought Fulham level and \n at Selhurst Park. It should have been a result to ignite a season for a side including Dimitar Berbatov and Damien Duff but instead they would lose their next seven matches and by the time they next won, Martin Jol had been sacked \n.\n\u201cIt was my breakthrough year in the Premier League; I was very young at \n, I had arrived from a very good team in Italy and joined an excellent one with the likes of Damien Duff, Bobby Zamora, Steve Sidwell, Scott Parker and Dimitar Berbatov. We had a very good and strong team but we didn\u2019t get the results and the new chairman, Shahid Khan, changed the coach and after things were different.\n\u201cIt was my third year at Fulham. I was starting, playing almost every game and in a very confident mood as I was at Fulham in the Premier League. I got attention from a lot of teams as well. I became a regular for the Switzerland team, so it was a very good moment but, unfortunately, we were not having a good season. Personally, I had a very good spell but the results weren\u2019t good and \n and things changed a lot after.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just the goal that make the spell special for Kasami, he felt very settled in London and was finally a regular after a tumultuous time since arriving from Palermo in 2011. After Fulham\u2019s relegation was confirmed under \n, Kasami departed for Greece.\n\u201cI have made some not so good decisions in my career which I start to pay for now. I had a very good spell after Fulham with Olympiakos, where we won the league and played in the Champions League. My agent pushed me to leave England, that agent was Mino Raiola. Personally, it was going well but the team went down and I was very frustrated and disappointed by what happened. To be honest I was willing to leave England and the Premier League but in the end it was not a good decision.\u201d\nAt the end of 2019 the lists were drawn up for the Premier League\u2019s goal of the decade, which Kasami featured highly on, giving people a reminder of the natural talent the 27-year-old possesses.\n\u201cI was watching Monday Night Football and after the match, [Gary] Neville and [Jamie] Carragher were showing the best goals of the decade in the Premier League and I watched it back and thought: \u2018Wow! Bloody hell!\u2019 I think every time you see it you realise more how good it was.\n\u201cFor me, the Premier League is the best in the world and to score one like this will stay with me for ever. It makes me very proud. To score like this you need skill, it\u2019s not just hitting a shot from 60 metres, it is pure technique and control. I prefer scoring goals with pure control rather than just hitting it as hard as possible. I was unlucky as [Jack] Wilshere also scored against Norwich [the same weekend] and that was a goal of the season. I think it was because Arsenal had more influence than Fulham.\u201d\nAs Fulham try to make their way back to the top-flight once again, their supporters are always keen to be reminded of happier times. \u201cThe fans tweet me sometimes, especially on the anniversary. The Premier League Twitter account posted it and Fulham retweeted it, so I got fans saying: \u2018What a goal\u2019, \u2018You should come back\u2019 and things like that. It\u2019s always nice to get a positive reaction and love.\u201d\nKasami hopes to play in England again but knows he will not be able to recreate his once-in-a-lifetime goal, although he will be more than happy to try.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/feb/12/hand-of-god-maradona-style-handball-goal-goes-unnoticed-in-afc-cup-video": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/feb/12/hand-of-god-maradona-style-handball-goal-goes-unnoticed-in-afc-cup-video", "title": "Hand of God: Maradona-style handball goal goes unnoticed in AFC Cup \u2013 video", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 10:28:05 GMT", "summary": "<p>A moment to make Diego Maradona proud as Ceres\u2013Negros FC's Josh Grommen scored a goal with his hand during an AFC Cup match in the Philippines.

Although they only won the league by 21 points, that was in a season where only two points were awarded for a win. If that was converted to three points then Vardar would have finished 31 ahead of Sileks Kratovo.\n\u201cIn the 2007-08 Botswana Premier League, \n finished 23 points ahead of Gaborone United,\u201d Harry continues.

Their home ground is the Olympiastadion, which, since renovations in 2004, has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats. They even stayed there for their stint in the 2. Bundesliga (instead of moving to the Poststadion as they did when they were relegated in the 80s).\n\u201cThe runner-up might be Juventus, who were forcibly relegated after the Calciopoli scandal in 2006, while the Stadio delle Alpi had a capacity of 69,000 (although they usually only filled a third of it). Juve actually used the relegation to move out of the unloved and old stadium to their smaller-capacity traditional ground Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, while building a new stadium on the grounds of the demolished Stadio delle Alpi, which they finished in 2011.\u201d\nTom Aldous can trump both of those. \u201cFluminense play at the Maracan\u00e3 which today has an official capacity of 78,838, but the highest ever gate there was 199,854 in 16 July 1950. In 1997 Fluminense were relegated to the Brazilian Serie B but worse was to come the following year when they were relegated again to Serie C. In 2000 they were promoted straight back to Serie A in a championship that is way too complicated for me to comprehend.\u201d\nIn 1997 the Maracan\u00e3 hosted \n between Cruzeiro and Villa Nova with an attendance of\n132,834, but by 2000 the capacity was reduced to around 100,000.

Queen\u2019s Park, who have played there since 1903, were relegated in 1939 \u2013 as well as several other times \u2013 but that\u2019s the closest relegation to the stadium\u2019s record attendance, and capacity has been gradually reduced since 1945.\u201d\nwrote ZonalMarking in May 2012. \nIn a word, no. \u201cIn the US, player swaps are more usual than in Europe, but player-manager swaps are just as rare,\u201d writes Dan Ryazansky of MetroFanatic.com. \u201cNevertheless, in 2002, the MetroStars (now NY Red Bulls) \n.

Wales under Gatland tended to recover quickly from a setback and with France at home in the next round, it will be an early indicator for the new regime of how much they have preserved. \n \nAs Eddie Jones rightly \n, international rugby is a game of increasingly fine margins. Had Stuart Hogg not got into a tangle inches from his own line and given England the position from which Ellis Genge scored the match-winning try, there might conceivably have been a different outcome. Once they go ahead England are a seriously tough team to reel in; they are less assured when they have to chase a game. Ireland, however, will have noted the improvement in English defensive line speed and the difference George Kruis made to their lineout efficiency. In Genge they also have an impact sub in every respect, with the Leicester loose-head growing steadily in assurance with every Test he plays. On the flip side, England have lost the knack of scoring early tries and seizing the initiative. They were bailed out at Murrayfield by the excellent breakdown work of Sam Underhill, Tom Curry and Lewis Ludlam but Ireland will pose different questions in that area. \n \n\u201cWithout doubt,\u201d said Johnny Sexton when asked if the victory over Wales had marked his \n with Ireland for a while. \u201cIt was not hard after last year.\u201d It was his side\u2019s second victory in a week but the difference in the performance against Scotland was stark, as it had to be given the greater threat posed by the Six Nations champions. They quickly worked out a way to get the ball wide, regularly generated quick ball and were energised by their half-backs. What was most impressive was the composed fury they played with: there was a reaction to the week before, but it was measured and it shifted the immovable. It was also mechanical and they may need a bit more at Twickenham in the next round. \n \nGregor Townsend will hate this but the truth is there\u2019s only one topic that everyone\u2019s going to be talking about in the next fortnight, even though Finn Russell, gifted as he is, isn\u2019t a miracle fix that\u2019ll necessarily get Scotland winning again after back-to-back defeats. But given what Russell said in his recent interview with the Sunday Times about the way Townsend was running the team, this issue\u2019s blown up into something much bigger than a question of whether he ought to play at No 10 against Italy. Now it\u2019s about whether Townsend even ought to carry on as head coach, given that his star player has such a low opinion of the way he\u2019s doing things. \n \nFrance have won their \n for the first time since 2016 when they followed up a two-point victory over Italy at home with a 10-9 success over Ireland in Paris. Their third round match was their first away, in Cardiff, and they lost 19-10. It was the same in 2014, home wins over England and Italy followed by a defeat in Wales. A statistic that shows how far they slumped in the last decade is that their last away victory in the Six Nations other than in Italy or Scotland was in Dublin in 2011. They are on the up, if still mercurial as they showed against Italy, and this time in Cardiff they will have Shaun Edwards on their side. \n \nIt was already clear that women\u2019s grand slam champions England performed excellently in their victory away in France on the opening weekend. But in view of France\u2019s 45-10 demolition of Italy on Saturday, the value of England\u2019s win became even clearer. Italy had beaten Wales away the previous week, but were blown away by Les Bleus in Limoges. It seems certain that England, whose second match against Scotland was postponed due to Storm Ciara, cannot afford to slip up if they are to defend their Six Nations title. France are contenders but it is Ireland who top the table after an emphatic victory of their own, 31-12 at home against Wales on Sunday. They are top, with nine points from two matches, and England know they have their work cut out. \nThe Azzurri showed ambition against France, as they had in Cardiff, and produced well-worked tries, but for all the individual excellence of their back row, they could do with another Mauro Bergamasco. Too many moves ended because forwards, and backs, were standing in anticipation of the ball being moved rather than making sure it was secured. They were too often turned over and need to get Jake Polledri using his strength over the ball at times and not just on the charge or in the tackle.

However, if the outcome of Thursday morning\u2019s pow-wow between the good and the great of the 20 member clubs is anything to go by, the reality is far more prosaic and mundane.\nIt is not often the Premier League members vote for any wheeze that is not entirely in their own interests, but they are prone to the occasional rick. Their wheeze to close the past two summer transfer windows prior to the start of the season proved a grave misstep, as it gave their European rivals an extra three weeks to shamelessly court, unsettle and plunder their players, leaving squads full of holes they couldn\u2019t fill. It is an error they have \n, deciding to once again fall in line with the rest of Europe (as the country they represent falls out) and move this year\u2019s closing date back to 1 September.\n\u201cOne of the reasons is because the immigration system is going to change and it may be that it\u2019s the last window where freedom of movement is possible,\u201d cheered Premier League chief suit Richard Masters. \u201cClubs may want to take advantage of the longer window to make sure that they\u2019ve taken full advantage.\u201d Any changes to the immigration system will, of course, be prompted by the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union which, while \u201cdone\u201d in the Tory sense of the word, remains so hopelessly up in the air that nobody yet knows how it will affect football transfers. While many of the more vocal and patriotic Union Jack-wavers among the fanbases of assorted clubs may be delighted that Boris Johnson and his cronies have succeeded in \u201ctaking back control\u201d, it remains to be seen how thrilled they\u2019ll be when they discover their team has been stymied in its attempt to sign some midfield schemer from Portugal or Germany because their CV doesn\u2019t tick the requisite boxes required for them to secure a work permit.\nAnd while that Chelsea fan who gatecrashed a live Irish news report to raucously eff and jeff his support for both his football team and the UK\u2019s withdrawal in Parliament Square last Friday might argue these restrictions would only apply to players who aren\u2019t much good, they would be wrong. Had he required one, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is just one of several hundred European players in English football\u2019s top two tiers who wouldn\u2019t have had enough international caps to qualify for a work permit before moving to England. One shudders to think how Chelsea would have fared in recent years without him.\n\u201cWe have identified inaccuracies in the translation of Sky Sports News\u2019 interview with Alfredo Morelos. We apologise to both football clubs as well as Alfredo Morelos for the issues caused by these errors. After numerous steps undertaken by Sky to verify the interview thoroughly we can be clear that at no point did Morelos allege that any racial abuse was directed at him by [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters in the interview. We apologise to the [Queen\u2019s] Celtic supporters for this serious error. We are reviewing our procedures for translated interviews to ensure this does not occur in future.

Anyhow, the Queen\u2019s Celtic have responded by lodging a complaint with Ofcom and publishing said letter in full.\n\u201cContinuing the thread of pre-match music (Fiver letters passim), I remember going to see the original Wimbledon playing my team, Stockport County, and listening to the DJ discussing how he had thought long and hard about the music to play to show empathy to Chelsea who had suffered a defeat that week in Big Cup. And then he played the \u2018chorus\u2019 of \n\u201d \u2013 Brian Ross.\n\u201cOnce went to a pre-season friendly between Leamington and Leicester.

Sherrock not only won two matches in the world championship but on Thursday in Nottingham she will \n.\nShe has also been exalted on social media, with plaudits for her sporting breakthrough ranging from \n to Instagram posts by Sarah Jessica Parker who wrote of Sherrock: \u201cMaking history and our hearts stop as \n.\u201d But, after 45 minutes in Sherrock\u2019s company, it is plain that bleak misogyny has fired her determination.\nIt stretches back to the time, more than five years ago, when Sherrock fell ill soon after giving birth to her son. A mysterious kidney ailment caused her face to become bloated. She kept playing darts despite the wounding comments made about her appearance \u2013 just as she keeps on when she is vilified for daring to play professional darts against men.\nSherrock raises a wry eyebrow over her glasses, and taps her long painted fingernails patiently on the table, when I ask if online hate continues alongside the delight accompanying her world championship success. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re always going to get hate. Obviously no one says anything to me, but it\u2019s different online. People just hide behind the computer at home.\u201d\nBut she uses that hate? \u201cDefinitely. If I\u2019m feeling a bit slouchy, I\u2019ll look at some of the comments and I\u2019ll be like: \u2018OK, now I need to prove you wrong.\u2019\u201d\nSherrock also points out that she has not had to do this since the world championship. \u201cI\u2019ve not been slouchy this year at all. A few years back I got complacent. That\u2019s when I needed to fire myself up. Now if I see any of the bad comments I go past them. Or my management team takes it away so I don\u2019t have to look at it. In the past I used to take it to heart. It made me stronger and more determined to prove everyone wrong. But if I hadn\u2019t been strong\u2011minded I could have buckled from all the nasty comments.\u201d\nDoes she ever confront the trolls online? \u201cI\u2019ve not been tempted to call anyone out because most of them making comments don\u2019t play darts. So they don\u2019t understand anything. And those just trying to be nasty need to be ignored. If I react it\u2019s giving them fuel and I\u2019m not that type of person. If I start commenting back, I\u2019d be as bad as them. Anyway, if you just wondered what everyone thought all the time you wouldn\u2019t achieve anything.\u201d\nSherrock achieved a memorable and historic feat when she beat Ted Evetts in the opening round of the world championship. She was one of two women who had battled through the qualifiers to reach the main draw. Mikuru Suzuki played James Richardson a few days before Sherrock\u2019s debut. Suzuki came close to becoming the first woman to win a match at the world championship \n. \u201cI watched it at home and I was egging Mikuru on to win,\u201d Sherrock says. \u201cShe missed out by a few darts. But that definitely inspired me. I\u2019d never had the opportunity to prove myself before but I knew I had the game to beat Ted.\u201d\nAs the match unfolded was she conscious of the crowd\u2019s support for her? \u201cDefinitely. It made me feel so comfortable and confident. I know it sounds ridiculous, because there were so many people, but I felt so calm up there. I didn\u2019t feel nervous at all. But once I\u2019d won I was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know if I wanted to cry or jump around. I was so happy and excited.\u201d\nSherrock\u2019s victory unleashed so many tributes that, once again, she felt swamped by an intense mix of emotions. \u201cWhen Billie Jean King started tweeting messages to me I was like: \u2018Wow, this amazing person\u2019s actually contacted me.\u2019 I\u2019m just a normal girl from Milton Keynes. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen to people like me. And then it was the Instagram post from Sarah Jessica Parker. I watched Sex and the City so that was amazing as well. To have two massive people contact me was incredible. I was like: \u2018Fallon, don\u2019t get too carried away. Just put it to one side and you can come back and stare at it later.\u2019 I focused on what I had to do.\u201d\nIn the second round she \n. Sherrock\u2019s face lights up at the memory. \u201cIt was such a privilege to play Mensur. He was the 11th best player in the world and I see him on TV all the time. When I got over the line against him I couldn\u2019t believe it. But the reason I won is that I finished it so coolly. I was proud of that. It was even more intense afterwards. I was in such disbelief but the spectators were a lot more behind me and they were jumping about. You could feel the electricity in the air. It was brilliant.\n\u201cBut it was hard for Mensur. They were booing him quite a bit. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for anyone to get booed doing something they love. But if there were more women playing more often, if we had more opportunities to play in the big tournaments, it wouldn\u2019t be a novelty to watch. I want to be cheered because I\u2019m a good player rather than because I\u2019m a novelty underdog. I think I\u2019ve changed that a little bit. People don\u2019t just see a woman playing when they look at me. They see a decent player whose [gender] doesn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cI \n in the third round but I enjoyed every moment. I put in a great performance and he had to pull out everything to beat me. I\u2019m really proud I made him bring out his best game.\u201d\nHow have the men on the PDC circuit reacted to her? \u201cWe\u2019re all friends,\u201d Sherrock says. \u201cBut when we get to the oche we switch off and play hard. I think it was different a while ago but attitudes have definitely changed. The men I\u2019ve played are all respectful and gentlemen towards me. I\u2019ve never really had a problem. In the past a lot of people would go: \u2018We\u2019re playing a woman.\u2019 But now they\u2019re thinking: \u2018We\u2019re playing a good player.\u2019\u201d\nSherrock admits it is more challenging for her to play against \n. \u201cAgainst the men I have a point to prove. So I have more determination whereas, when I\u2019m playing the women, we know each other\u2019s games so well. I need that extra boost just to prove to the men we can compete against them.\u201d\nLast month \n because the prize money had been slashed. \u201cI got the email saying it was going to be cut from \u00a320,000 to \u00a38,000 and that\u2019s a massive drop. The prize money is the main thing for me \u2013 because I\u2019ve got to support my little boy. I could not justify playing in the competition because I also didn\u2019t know if I was going to get paid at all.\u201d\nSuzuki won the tournament, beating Ashton in the final, but Sherrock says: \u201cThey still haven\u2019t been paid and it\u2019s a month later. So I don\u2019t regret that decision at all.\u201d\nShe played in a celebrity tournament in Germany instead, alongside Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen, and \n, the former Italian footballer and 2006 World Cup winner. As the single parent of an autistic son, Rory, Sherrock has financial responsibilities while juggling her onerous schedules as a mum and a new star in darts.\n\u201cHe\u2019s quite happy at the moment,\u201d she says of her son. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m really busy, he\u2019s like: \u2018So what are you buying me next?\u2019 I keep buying him a toy every time, and he loves it.\u201d\nBeing a parent of an autistic child is not easy, as Sherrock acknowledges. \u201cIt has been very difficult. But I\u2019ve got a good family support and I\u2019ve worked out a routine that works for him now. When all this kicked off at the worlds it just exploded. So we\u2019ve had to adjust. I\u2019m now at home in the week, looking after my little boy and doing all my work while he\u2019s at school. He goes away to his nan\u2019s on weekends when I\u2019m playing. So it\u2019s like he has my rules and then no rules at his nanny\u2019s. So whenever I am away he feels like he\u2019s on vacation. But any changes I need, my mum helps out a lot. So it\u2019s working out.\u201d\nSherrock has been even more impressive since the world championship in the way she has coped with her sudden fame and increased commitments. This month, among 200 other players, she \n, which will give her another chance to play against the world\u2019s best men in March. \u201cI was absolutely delighted because after \n, where I didn\u2019t get my [PDC] tour card, qualifying for the UK Open was my next goal.\u201d\nHer success at the world championship also meant Sherrock has been invited to compete in the Premier League as one of nine challengers against the top nine men in professional darts. Her debut in the competition marks another milestone for Sherrock and all female darts players. \u201cAny game I play on TV is a big deal for me,\u201d she stresses, \u201cbecause I just want to show people what I can do. And playing in the Premier League makes me so excited. Same goes for being \n in New York and other places. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\nI like the way Sherrock tells me that, when she was a girl, she dreamed of becoming a forensic scientist. But, now, she is simply intent on making more sporting history. Can she beat Glen Durrant on Thursday \u2013 her first Premier League opponent? \u201cI\u2019ve never played Glen but when I was on the BDO circuit he was a three-time BDO world champion. So I know how well he plays. He\u2019ll just play the board and won\u2019t worry about the crowd or playing me.\u201d\nSherrock\u2019s eyes glitter as she anticipates another big night in her transformed career. All the trolls and haters who haunted and then motivated her retreat further into the shadows as she says: \u201cI don\u2019t ever believe I\u2019m going to lose when I go out there. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself, there\u2019s no point playing.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/07/england-jofra-archer-cricket-barney-ronay": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/07/england-jofra-archer-cricket-barney-ronay", "title": "England have broken Jofra Archer \u2013 and no one can say it wasn\u2019t coming | Barney Ronay", "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 18:30:59 GMT", "summary": "Let\u2019s not dress it up.

Archer has been miserably treated this winter, and only occasionally by the opposition. He has carried a serious injury, undiagnosed. He\u2019s been rebuked for riding a Segway, thereby embarrassing his coaches in front of the CEO, a tier-one crime against the blue Lycra hierarchy. He\u2019s been asked to bowl 42 overs in his first overseas Test, or 5% of all the balls he\u2019d ever bowled in first-class cricket. He\u2019s been in tears after failing a fitness test in Johannesburg he should never, with hindsight, have been asked to take.\nLook clearly and Archer is entirely blameless in all of these things: a self-made 24-year-old cricketer, an inspiring story against the odds, and a man who might smile to himself at being lectured on toughness in adversity by the pathway products around him. So what is happening here?\nTwo things stand out. First, Archer is an outsider in so many ways in the narrow parish of elite English cricket. It isn\u2019t simply the fact he grew up in Barbados, or is a rare black male cricketer to earn a full ECB contract. It\u2019s also the fact he\u2019s from another place as a sportsman, talked about as though he\u2019s some bright-eyed creature found shivering in the treeline, the guy who wears his jumper around his waist, who doesn\u2019t carry the familiar signifiers of this sealed sporting-industrial life.\nStatements such as these should be seen in the context of both these layers of otherness: \u201cHe needs to ramp it up more ... The energy and effort have to be there all the time.\u201d \u201cWe want every ball to be an effort ball.\u201d \u201cYour body hurts at times ... You\u2019ve just got to choose to do it, really.\u201d \u201cCulturally he is different.\u201d\nThe words, there, of England\u2019s captain, head coach and director of cricket at various times this winter. Speaking, to be clear, about a bloke bowling through a stress fracture, while leading England\u2019s attack in his first season of international cricket. All of these quotes are set in the middle of warm words about Archer\u2019s performances, all couched with sympathetic talk about how much he is putting in. But still, there are words and phrases that jar. Trying hard. Culture. Effort. \u201cYes, this does hurt, son. But get on with it, eh?\u201d\nPlus we\u2019ve had the standard klaxon-parping talk about body language, about unacceptable diet, about the need to really \u201cbust a gut\u201d in training. Nobody else gets this stuff. Nobody mentions Stuart Broad\u2019s up-and-down intensity levels, the sense of a bowler (successfully and correctly) looking after himself. Nobody urges Joe Root himself to put \u201cmore effort\u201d in or talks about mental fragility when he keeps getting out just past 50. Why not?\nI\u2019m not qualified to define the mechanics of being a black athlete in a white sporting culture. But you do see patterns, faint memories of the way football has been, echoes of Daniel Sturridge (but not Andy Carroll) being accused of having \u201ca low pain threshold\u201d or Ron Noades talking about the need for hard white players to get you through the winter.\nI don\u2019t think this is conscious, or founded in ill-will. But it strikes a false note. More to the point, it won\u2019t help get the best out of a stellar, highly specialised cricketing talent. Clearly there is a need to take a look at how England\u2019s homogeneous \u201cteam culture\u201d deals with difference, outsiderdom and unusual ways of being a highly talented cricketer.\nThis isn\u2019t just about accepting some people walk and speak and respond a little differently. It\u2019s about the need to take care of a once-in-a-generation athlete who can bowl his second ball at 92mph, and who should be treated with the level of informed sports science his talent demands.\nThe issue of \u201cover-bowling\u201d will of course rumble around, a process that feels like using your handcrafted Glock pistol to bang in a fence post, but which is above all a sign of confusion.\nThe only people I\u2019ve heard talk compelling sense about Archer are Mike Selvey, who compared his style to Jeff Thomson, and seemed to say if you think Archer\u2019s not trying you don\u2019t understand the mechanics of fast bowling; and Archer\u2019s coach at the Rajasthan Royals, who works specifically on short bursts, on understanding his specific physicality, his personality, the way his body works.\nFor now a quiet apology and a reboot in the relationship would be a good start. Handled right, Archer can be a source of delight. This is what success looks like: right there. Time perhaps to ask him what he needs, rather than tell him.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/06/edwin-moses-interview-donald-mcrae-athletics", "title": "Edwin Moses: \u2018We all knew doping was happening ... it was a dark period in athletics\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 13:06:42 GMT", "summary": "The two-time Olympic 400m hurdles champion on his fight against doping, his amazing unbeaten streak and meeting Nelson Mandela<p>The number 999 is burned into Edwin Moses\u2019s psyche.

He holds the greatest winning streak in athletics for, as a two-times Olympic champion over 400m hurdles, Moses was unbeaten for \n.\nFrom August 1977 to June 1987, he won 122 consecutive races but the worldly American, who is also a physicist and the chairman emeritus of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, has spent enough time in other countries, such as Britain, to know 999 is also the number to call in an emergency.\nFor much of his life the struggle against doping has felt like an emergency to Moses. It explains why he has been at the forefront of anti-doping for 32 years and why, even now, he is such a vocal proponent of clean sport.\nMoses has helped lead the clampdown on \n. He continues to monitor the situation in regard to a likely blanket ban on all Russian athletes competing in this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, even as \u201cauthorised neutrals\u201d, and he is heartened that last week World Athletics hardened its stance. Real changes and genuine contrition need to be shown by the Russian Athletics Federation to avoid the ban on all its individual athletes. This is a fight Moses has waged for decades.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I worked out three times a day,\u201d he says when asked if he felt the shadow of doping among his rivals even when he seemed invincible as an athlete. \u201cI ate properly. I had a great stretching programme. I had a great physical therapist. I did all kinds of innovative training exercises. I swam. Did weights. But I also did it because I knew it would make me the best.\u201d\nThis was not the template used by cheating athletes. \u201cWe all knew it was happening,\u201d Moses says. \u201cWe knew doping was wide scale because there was no drug testing \u2013 beyond being able to detect drugs for three or four days. It was unabated.\n\u201cI\u2019m a physicist. I\u2019ve got a biology and chemistry background. I wanted to be a doctor. So I was shocked when I went to the 1976 Olympics and saw some of the eastern bloc women. They were much more manly than me.\n\u201cThen, in the 1980s, more athletes used performance-enhancing drugs because out-of-competition testing did not exist. There was no test for testosterone or growth hormones then. EPO was brand new. So there was unabated use of these drugs all over the world.\n\u201cA few athletes spoke up but many made comments out of expediency. It was a dark period in my sport and it\u2019s continued for a long time. It\u2019s finally changing now but I was one of the few who spoke out at the start. People who protest, and do the right thing, usually don\u2019t have anything to gain. I was winning anyway so there was nothing for me to gain. I could have done nothing and track and field would have been worse than it is today. I made a difference. That\u2019s why we have out-of-competition drug testing \u2013 because of what I and a few others did in 1988.\u201d\nAthletics has never recovered from its loss of legitimacy in \n, the 100m final at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when Ben Johnson, the initial winner, failed a drug test. Serious questions, at the very least, have been raised over the other seven finalists. Moses, who won bronze in the 400m hurdles at those Games, when he was 33 and competing in his final Olympics, felt an even sharper desire to clean up his sport.\n\u201c\n, I put together a group of 10 US athletes. We demanded [out-of-competition] testing in the US. We got the money and legislation and drew up the drug programme from scratch because no one had ever done it. We got it ratified and the following year the US Olympic Committee adopted our programme. I became the chief of US testing from 1989 to 1994.\n\u201cThere was no such thing as Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] and, in the US, I was chairman of the committee for the big six Olympic sports. I negotiated agreements to test athletes and that was the first testing outside competition.\u201d\nThe 64-year-old Moses seems energised by World Athletics. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an outstanding battle in the fight against doping and hopefully the corrupt people are gone. \n. World Athletics put out a statement saying unless the Russians apologise for the last transgression [when their federation conspired to hide the truth with the 2018 world indoor high jump champion, Danil Lysenko, who missed three doping tests], they\u2019re rescinding the possibility of their athletes competing in Tokyo. Period. They\u2019ll stop all of them.\u201d\nAt the world championships in Doha last October, 29 Authorised Neutral Athletes from Russia won six medals \u2013 despite their country being banned for four years. \u201cThe ones they allowed to compete [in Doha] were tested as much as anyone else. If they can\u2019t show the same evidence there\u2019s no reason to let them compete. I feel that way about any athlete from the many areas of the world where there\u2019s very little testing. But this latest news is significant. Someone\u2019s got to stand up for the right thing.\u201d\nDoes he expect Russia to back down and apologise? \u201cNo. I doubt it.\u201d\nMoses is justifiably proud of his role in toughening up Wada \u2013 as the anti-doping agency seemed subservient to the International Olympic Committee. Moses and Beckie Scott, the chair of Wada\u2019s Athlete Committee, became embroiled in a row with the organisation. \n in 2018 over her opposition to reinstating Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency. Moses supported Scott and he was told to \u201cshut up\u201d by some Wada officials.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that \u2013 alongside Beckie and others on the athletes\u2019 commission \u2013 we forced Wada to look at its governance,\u201d Moses says. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ve been able to \n. Changes were made to bring an ethical balance to the way Wada is run internally. The Russians got caught red-handed and the evidence was clear from two investigations.\n\u201cBut politically it was perceived differently because of the money Russia puts into sports. If it had been a completely independent group that had nothing to do with international federations or the IOC, it would not have dragged on. At Wada they had federation guys and IOC guys who were not looking out for the best [anti-doping] interests. That was the innate problem. We forced them to deal with those issues.\u201d\nWill Wada be stronger now? \u201cWe will see. The new president at Wada, Witold Banka, is a [former Poland] athlete. I think the strain in anti-doping politics has been taken out because the leadership has changed. That was the elephant in the room. It started at the top [with the former president Craig Reedie being associated with the IOC].\u201d\nIs the war against doping being won? \u201cOur deterrent model is very important. New software packages mean we\u2019re able to buy the right tests that can withstand the legal, analytical and statistical scrutiny required to prove a test is conclusive. Drugs are being detected for longer periods of time. They\u2019re now looking at proteins in the body that change immediately upon use of growth hormone, testosterone, EPO. We can detect more because we\u2019re looking at protein chains, 200 or 300 segments long, in the DNA. That\u2019s brought in a whole new way of testing.\u201d\nMoses is also a passionate ambassador for \n \u2013 the group that celebrates the power of sport to transform the lives of millions of people. He cites the moment when he \n at the inaugural Laureus awards in 2000 as \u201cone of the big moments of my life. What he said that night, about the power of sport, was so pertinent. I saw people crying in the audience. From then on I applied all the hard work, the discipline, the winning \u2013 all the positive things I learned from sport \u2013 to Laureus and helped build a great organisation. It\u2019s been as satisfying as sport itself.\u201d\nStressing the wider social and political power of sport, Moses encourages athletes to protest openly against racism, homophobia and other forms of injustice. He talks knowledgeably about football\u2019s enduring problems with racism and supports those England players who have \n the next time they are subjected to racial abuse. \u201cI would agree with them. If that\u2019s what it takes, that\u2019s a small price to pay for the indignity human beings suffer. I would have walked off the track if I had seen something like that.\u201d\nMoses also backs \n against police brutality and racism in the US. In contrast, when asked about Donald Trump, Moses says: \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about our president.\u201d\nThe IOC has said it will ban \n but Moses rejects this aim. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can stop it. It\u2019s an individual discretionary endeavour and history shows you can\u2019t stop protest.\u201d\nSporting history confirms that, for those nine years, nine months and nine days, Moses was also unstoppable. Before he races off to his next meeting in Atlanta I ask him about the astonishing streak that began after he lost a race in Berlin against the German 400m hurdler Harald Schmid. A week later in D\u00fcsseldorf, Moses beat Schmid by 15 metres. Did the pain of defeat drive him for the next decade?\n\u201cThat was a funny day. Before the race I\u2019m sitting at the pool when I should\u2019ve been working out at the track. But I was winning the race until I made a mistake at the last hurdle because I was running so slow. I used 14 steps instead of 13. That\u2019s why I lost. But it taught me a lesson. You have to be 100% ready all the time. Don\u2019t take anything for granted. After that I did not have any problems for almost 10 years.\u201d\nWas it particularly painful when he finally lost a race, to Danny Harris? \u201cNo. When I first started I lost all the time. Losing is part of the game. If you lose you figure out what you did wrong and fix it up. If it had been another five metres, I would probably have caught him. I\u2019d been suffering from food poisoning and nearly pulled out but I was paid my money and I ran.\u201d\nA few months later, Moses beat Harris to gold at the world championships. \u201cI was happy and the fact I had lost to him was beside the point. Most people lose.\u201d\nMoses almost always won but is there a danger his remarkable sporting record may be forgotten? \u201cNo. Just last week Tiger Woods said he believed \n. As time goes on, it becomes more meaningful and significant. It\u2019s been 33 years since I quit. No one\u2019s even come close to my record. And it\u2019s doubtful anyone will.\u201d\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/west-ham-gilly-flaherty-interview": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/west-ham-gilly-flaherty-interview", "title": "West Ham\u2019s Gilly Flaherty: \u2018People will be shocked because I\u2019m always happy\u2019", "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2020 09:59:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Club captain speaks publicly for the first time about the attempt to take her own life aged 17 and why it\u2019s important to talk</p><p>\u201cIt was the unknown,\u201d says West Ham\u2019s Gilly Flaherty. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen when I went to hospital.

The day before they had sent out a tweet saying: \u2018These letters are the hardest letters to write.\u2019 Then they passed away. And I thought: \u2018I have to do this.\u2019\u201d\nFlaherty\u2019s career is packed with trophies. Seven FA Cups, eight top\u2011division titles, a Champions League win as a part of Arsenal\u2019s quadruple winners; few have had such success. \u201cI think I could have gone through my whole career not having mentioned what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d the 28-year-old captain reflects. \u201cI\u2019m a different person now to the person I was back then \u2013 I\u2019m stronger now. But what\u2019s the point in going through stuff if I don\u2019t think I can benefit someone from it?\n\u201cPeople will probably be shocked. They won\u2019t be expecting it from me because I\u2019m such a bubbly person and I\u2019m always happy. And I am now, but back then I wasn\u2019t and there\u2019s a reason why I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt was moving away from home, from Millwall\u2019s youth teams, and going to Arsenal\u2019s academy, that started the spiral. Flaherty is fiercely sensitive and close to her family. She struggled to cope with being separated from them, and with the death of her grandmother and great aunt. At the same time she was struggling with her sexuality.\n\u201cI say to my mum now that I wish I\u2019d never gone. That\u2019s nothing against Arsenal but I just wish now that I would have stayed at home, gone to college and learned a trade and come out with something.\n\u201cI was in the academy Monday to Friday. Now my mum will have a go at me when I don\u2019t pick up the phone and ring her. Families have WhatsApp groups but when I was younger, I\u2019d go Monday through Friday and I wouldn\u2019t talk to them all week. I wasn\u2019t doing well in college, I wasn\u2019t interested. I was going through things \u2026 I knew I was gay. I had known I was gay for a long time but as you get older you start to think about relationships, you\u2019re talking about taking things a bit further than just liking someone or thinking someone\u2019s nice looking.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all of the unknown. OK, I\u2019m gay but what do I do? Do I go to gay bars? There\u2019s no education about it when you\u2019re younger. How do I find gay girls? Where do I find a partner? I did think when I was growing up that I would be this silly old woman with 100 dogs. And you worry about how your parents will react. You don\u2019t want to disappoint them.\u201d\nThen there was the football. \u201cI was with Arsenal\u2019s first team but I wasn\u2019t playing. I was on the bench. With the team they had it was no surprise but I don\u2019t think I handled that well and I don\u2019t really think I had the right guidance as a younger player.\u201d\nShe was cripplingly lonely. That was the context, the cocktail of emotions, that fuelled the attempt to take her own life aged 17. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d been educated about it. Read something. Or had someone grab hold of me. It\u2019s hard because some people have no one.\u201d\nThere was a heavy helping of luck involved in her survival. It was lucky the lock on her door was broken, enabling her housemate to find her and get her to hospital, where she was put on a drip. \u201cJayne Ludlow and Ciara Grant, Arsenal players at the time, worked in the academy and were sort of the on-call leaders. They came to the hospital and I remember saying to Jayne: \u2018Please don\u2019t call my mum or dad, I don\u2019t want them to know.\u2019 And she was like: \u2018Gilly, how can I not call your mum and dad? We have to tell them.\u2019\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be told off for doing it. I don\u2019t want people to judge me now on that because I\u2019m a completely different person to the person I was then. My mum said to me the other night: \u2018I really worry when you go quiet. Whether it be on social media or the WhatsApp group. Because then I wonder.\u2019 And I said that I would never ever do it again; it would never even come into my mind to do it.\n\u201cBack then I didn\u2019t talk to anyone but I also didn\u2019t think about anyone else. I didn\u2019t think about my mum and dad, I didn\u2019t think about my family. Whereas now there\u2019s no way I would even consider leaving those people behind.\u201d\nProviding help and support is key. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people out there you can talk to but something is stopping people from actually doing it. That\u2019s what is hard. With suicide there\u2019s no second chances. If it\u2019s debt problems, gambling, addiction, struggling with your sexuality, is it bad enough that you want to end your life or is there an alternative? We need to make sure we have as many outlets and alternatives as possible for people.\u201d\nComing out to her parents months helped to lift a weight. \u201cMy mum and dad knew that I was gay, even if I hadn\u2019t told them.\u201d\nThough she never hid her relationship with her partner, Lily, coming out publicly with the Rainbow Laces campaign in 2018 further lifted the weight. Now, talking about the attempt to take her own life is a part of her owning something she thinks about daily. \u201cIt will never leave me,\u201d she says.\nIt is an experience, though, that has made her better able to deal with struggles and manage her feelings. \u201cI now know to talk. When I was younger, during that time, I was never allowed to show emotion. Crying on the pitch was a no go. Because if you cry on the pitch people will think you can\u2019t handle it. Whereas now I cry watching everything on the telly. I\u2019m not going to hide it. I\u2019ll cry over everything.\n\u201cI\u2019m an emotional person and I\u2019m a loving person. I\u2019ve gone through so much worse than that now. But I just think: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to bow down. I\u2019m not going to let anything defeat me.\u2019\u201d\n"}}, "Entertaniment & Arts": {"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/12/were-playing-to-the-world-galways-european-capital-of-culture-year-kicks-off": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/12/were-playing-to-the-world-galways-european-capital-of-culture-year-kicks-off", "title": "'We're playing to the world': Galway's European capital of culture year kicks off", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:57:22 GMT", "summary": "<p>Galway 2020 promises everything from Margaret Atwood to art with local asylum-seekers.

She\u2019s moving to Ireland to discover whether the country of her imagination can survive the test of lived experience. Striking a note of guarded optimism that captured the mood of the evening at Galway\u2019s Black Box theatre, the English author joined an ensemble of young Irish musicians and some of the most distinctive female voices in contemporary Irish literature, including \n and \n.\nThe irreverent, funny, unabashedly feminist performance emanated quiet confidence, which must have helped to steady the nerves of the artistic team behind \n, following a weekend of anticlimax. Having planned for months the open-air spectacle of light, fire, drumming and music to celebrate the start of Galway\u2019s year as European capital of culture, organisers had to cancel it at midday on Saturday, due to Storm Ciara. \nThe formal handover of the title of \n took place on Saturday afternoon, and despite disappointment, there was still a sense of occasion. The EU commissioner for trade, Phil Hogan, emphasised the importance of cultural relations and cultural diplomacy in Europe at this moment \u2013 the role of arts and culture in the European project is to \u201ctear down barriers and build bridges\u201d.\nSome of the bridges in most need of buttressing are closer to home. A bumpy start to the Galway 2020 project brought tensions and a turnover in key senior personnel. Funding remains a vexed question, with a modest \u20ac2m (\u00a31.68m) raised in sponsorship so far, instead of the \u20ac7m aimed for, against public funding of \u20ac25m. On Monday, an additional \u20ac2.5m requested from Galway City Council was refused, leaving its contribution at \u20ac6m. (\u20ac15m has come from the Department of Culture and \u20ac4m from Galway County Council.) In a statement, Galway 2020 CEO Patricia Philbin said some projects would have to be scaled back, and the team is \u201cdisappointed but resilient\u201d.\n\u201cIt has been difficult,\u201d admits creative director Helen Marriage. Her London-based events company, Artichoke, has decades of experience putting on large-scale open-air and community arts projects. Risk is always part of such work, but Marriage has never had to cancel an event before and she is clearly upset about it. Arriving in Galway early in 2019 to take up where the \nr left off was not easy either.\nFor the year-long celebration, Marriage and her team have commissioned a range of high-profile projects in partnership with European funding organisations, artists and companies. In March, there is an immense illumination by Finnish light designer and artist Kari Kola, deep in the mountains of Connemara. The spring programme includes international stars such as Laurie Anderson and \n.\nThe 2020 programme\u2019s themes of migration, language and landscape \u201cconnect to central questions about identity\u201d, says Marriage. \u201cWhat does it mean to be a Galwegian now, when a quarter of the area\u2019s population were not born in this country? Galway is the most diverse place in all of \n. And what does it mean to be Irish and European, to be a progressive European nation in an EU that is fracturing?\u201d\nProjects exploring this theme include one created with a primary school in Galway city where 39 languages are spoken by its pupils. City of Light, City of Sanctuary, meanwhile, will create a floating miniature city of lanterns to evoke the idea of home at a time of mass displacement. A new community opera called Paper Boat, composed by Elaine Agnew, will also take on exile and sanctuary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about only being local,\u201d says Marriage. \u201cMy role was to look at Galway from the outside in.\u201d She was drawn to projects that were unorthodox and unusual. \u201cThe programme is not about duplicating what\u2019s there already. It\u2019s [about] finding a new way of articulating what that sense of identity is now, while the nation is under the spotlight \u2026 It\u2019s a statement of values.\u201d She says it is important to provide some free events and to involve the community \u2013 including \n and Travellers.\nGalway has long been a magnet for artists from Ireland and abroad, thanks to the pioneering work of individuals and groups who came together in the 1970s and 80s to establish Druid Theatre, Galway international arts festival and Macnas street theatre ensemble, among others. Many more arts organisations have been added to that list over subsequent years: C\u00fairt festival of literature, Galway Film Fleadh, Babar\u00f3 children\u2019s arts festival, Galway theatre festival, plus Music for Galway, Galway Arts Centre and Branar children\u2019s theatre company.\nPresenting arts festivals is demonstrably what the city does best; what happens in between these bursts of activity is what concerns many practitioners, who hope that Galway 2020 might be a catalyst for more lasting change. Whether that legacy takes the form of infrastructure \u2013 new performance venues and rehearsal spaces, or a permanent contemporary art gallery \u2013 is open for debate. More fundamentally, artists need consistent funding to live and make work throughout the year and reach audiences in the rural areas.\nIn this, Galway typifies the reality for many Irish artists. Among the pressing issues facing the new government and the incoming director of the Arts Council of Ireland will be the need to address the working and living conditions of artists, as well as economic barriers to participation in the arts. In the EU, Ireland has the lowest investment per capita in the arts.\nNoeline Kavanagh, artistic director of Macnas, hopes the European capital of culture will help artists innovate and realise their potential. Her own project for the event is a series of multimedia promenade performances and installations. Macnas will stage episodes from the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh in four phases for each season of the year, working with a young, multiethnic cast, an international design, sound, music and film team, and the playwright Marina Carr.\n\u201cIt is on a scale that wouldn\u2019t be possible without Galway 2020,\u201d says Kavanagh. \u201cWe can really take a risk with this. Forty years of art-making here have got us to this point where we can play to the world. As a Galway-born artist, the coming year allows me to enable the next generation to have a platform, to create new work, new art forms even. Succession is essential but how do you sustain it?\u201d\n\u201cThe year is an opportunity for the arts to be seen not as a commodity to be measured, but as essential to society,\u201d she says. \u201cArtists are the guardians of the unpredictable; of the imagination, but we need to be supported. We can\u2019t be expected to live on nothing.\u201d\nEven an imagined Ireland needs some grounding in reality.\n \n.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/12/carla-gugino-interview-anatomy-of-a-suicide-jett": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/12/carla-gugino-interview-anatomy-of-a-suicide-jett", "title": "Carla Gugino: 'Sexuality is a primal part of who we are but it's been misused'", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:18:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>The star of Jett and Sin City is back on stage in Alice Birch\u2019s raw Anatomy of a Suicide.

An actor of variety and intellect, who often channels sexuality like some high-voltage current, she is currently starring in \n\u2019s Anatomy of a Suicide at the Atlantic Theater. She is described in the play \u2013 originally \n in London in 2017 \u2013 as \u201cthe most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. In the cafe, in a stripy turtleneck and yesterday\u2019s mascara, her hair pulled into a funny sort of pompadour, bent over a cup of herbal tea (isn\u2019t that what all bombshells drink?), she arguably is.\nIf you know Gugino from children\u2019s flicks (\n) or comic-book adaptations (Sin City, \n) or disaster movies (\n), you could be forgiven for wondering what she is doing in an avant garde off-Broadway drama. So here is what you should also know: in 2004, she made her Broadway debut, in Arthur Miller\u2019s After the Fall, playing Maggie, the turbulent, unforgiving Marilyn Monroe-inspired role. \u201cI felt like I was home,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd from that moment, I realised, \u2018Oh, this is a huge. This has to be something I do for the rest of my life.\u2019\u201d She has returned to theatre every few years including in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Desire Under the Elms, and in Athol Fugard\u2019s The Road to Mecca. Seven years ago, she and her partner, the writer and director Sebastian Gutierrez, relocated to Manhattan. So when she does a play, she can usually walk to work.\nAnatomy of a Suicide spoke to her, Gugino says, viscerally and intellectually. It simultaneously tracks three generations of women in three time periods (roughly: the 1970s, the 2000s, the 2030s), with many lines spoken in unison, which means that it demands extreme technical rigour. Playing a woman who wants to die makes emotional claims, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really tricky place to live in,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it costs you, this play. And it should.\u201d She has been reading accounts of suicidal ideation and listening to podcast interviews, working toward someone who \u201cis always trying to crack life. She just can\u2019t. And I relate to that. Life is really hard,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of us have those moments when you just don\u2019t know what your value is here and what the value of staying is,\u201d she says. \u201cSo for me, there were personal elements. She just spoke to me, this woman.\u201d\nHer character, Carol, has a perilous kind of magnetism. She fascinates people even \u2013 or especially \u2013 when she doesn\u2019t mean to. \u201cGod we were all so in love with you in school,\u201d another character says. \u201cI know literally three girls who started smoking because you used to smoke.\u201d Gugino\u2019s other current roles capitalise on that allure like Daisy, the thief she plays on the cable noir Jett (in televisual limbo now that Cinemax has killed its original programming division), or Stella, which she will act opposite Audra McDonald\u2019s Blanche and Bobby Cannavale\u2019s Stanley in a Streetcar Named Desire revival this summer.\nShe calls sexuality \u201ca primal part of who we are\u201d and \u201cpart and parcel of who I am\u201d and she\u2019s interested in exploring it in her work, she says, \u201cbecause as a woman, I find it to be a huge centre of our power that has been misused and misrepresented a lot of the time\u201d. (She doesn\u2019t quite put a movie like \n in that category, but she recognises that its sex scenes didn\u2019t come from character.) Still, she wished she weren\u2019t asked about it quite so often because it speaks to a certain American puritanism. \u201cI find it so interesting that you can see a nipple shot off, but you can\u2019t see a woman walking from the bed to the bathroom naked without being commented on.\u201d\nThe violence in Anatomy of a Suicide is psychological, self-inflicted. Before each show, she prepares by running lines and listening to a piece of music that moves her closer to Carol, \u201ca lullaby of death, basically\u201d, she says. She and the rest of the cast take three breaths together, a ritual the director Lileana Blain-Cruz developed. After the show, the cast take three more breaths and then she plays a song \u201cthat kind of brings me joy or makes me laugh or makes me want to dance\u201d, something to help her shake it off.\nEvery day, as she walks to work, she thinks about what she needs to accomplish that day, what her character will undergo. \u201cAnd I can feel,\u201d she says, \u201cthat part of me that\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t make me go there.\u2019\u201d But to know that she can? \u201cExhilaration.\u201d\n \n.\n \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/martin-amis-autobiographical-novel-inside-story-christopher-hitchens-9-11": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/martin-amis-autobiographical-novel-inside-story-christopher-hitchens-9-11", "title": "Martin Amis to publish novel inspired by death of Christopher Hitchens", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 12:15:29 GMT", "summary": "<p>An autobiographical novel, Inside Story, will chronicle the writer\u2019s romantic affairs, the death of Hitchens \u2013 his closest friend \u2013 and the 9/11 attacks</p><p>Martin Amis has written his \u201cmost intimate and epic work\u201d, an autobiographical novel that will draw on the death of his closest friend, the polemical writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/christopher-hitchens-cancer-interview\">Christopher Hitchens</a>.</p><p>Inside Story, published in September, is \u201cthe unseen portrait of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/24/martin-amis-novels-countdown-to-top-john-self\">Martin Amis</a>\u2019s extraordinary life\u201d, according to his publisher Jonathan Cape.

Gioia is an American musician and author: in the past, he\u2019s written a series of acclaimed books about jazz, but Music: A Subversive History is by some distance the most wide-ranging and provocative thing he\u2019s come up with.\nIn terms of scope, well, put it this way: it starts out talking about a bear\u2019s thighbone that Neanderthal hunters apparently turned into a primitive flute somewhere between 43,000 and 82,000 years ago and ends up, 450 pages later, discussing K-pop and EDM. His central theory: music is a kind of magical, ungovernable force that connects us to ancient shamanistic rituals, it\u2019s primarily fuelled by sex and violence \u2013 anyone horrified by the lyrics of drill or death metal should consider that the first instruments were made from body parts and would once have literally dripped with blood \u2013 and all attempts to reduce it to mathematical formulae or \u201cquasi-science\u201d, while useful, go against its intrinsic nature. He\u2019s really not keen on Pythagoras, whose mathematical theories about tuning underpin \u201cmusic as it is taught in every university and conservatory in the world today\u201d.\nI didn\u2019t agree with everything Gioia had to say, but something about that central theory stuck with me. For one thing, there is something magical and ungovernable about music: that weird tingling sensation you get when you hear something you love - a friend of mine calls it the Holy Shiver - is involuntary. It just \n. And we live in an era when music has never been more governed by mathematics. Algorithms are supposed to be able to predict everything, from what you want to hear next to whether or not a song\u2019s going to be a hit: the digital strategist who developed the software behind the AI record label that\u2019s just launched was also \u201cinvolved in the development and marketing of stars such as Avicii, Logic, Mike Posner and Swedish House Mafia\u201d.\nI use \n as much as anyone, but aside from their convenience, I\u2019m increasingly convinced their influence on music is almost entirely malign and restrictive. Last year, I talked to an extremely famous pop producer who detailed the impact that the necessity to get on streaming playlists has had on what he does. Everything from the length of a song\u2019s intro to the way it\u2019s mixed is controlled by their metrics, which means you\u2019re never going to get a pop single that stops people dead with its sheer leftfield WTFness: a Bohemian Rhapsody or a \n or a Good Vibrations. The algorithms that claim to predict what you\u2019ll want to hear next are based entirely on what you already like. Fair enough, but the most profound and affecting musical experiences don\u2019t come from having your existing tastes reaffirmed, but turned on their head: that moment when an artist or a genre you\u2019d previously dismissed unexpectedly reveals itself to you in all its glory; when it suddenly becomes apparent that something you\u2019d thought wasn\u2019t for you really is; when you\u2019re made aware of how ungovernable music is. Gioia is big on music\u2019s ability to temporarily disrupt, whether that\u2019s punk and hip-hop or Beethoven. It struck me that the big recent disruptions in British pop \u2013 the rise of grime and dubstep \u2013 happened before streaming services took control of music\u2019s transmission. Since then, there\u2019s been artistic developments, but they\u2019ve been incremental, nothing that counts as a radical shift; the disruptions, as Gioia points out, have \u201ctechnological and economic\u201d.\nBut Music: A Subversive History ends on an upbeat note. Gioia thinks music history is \u201can endless series of big bangs\u201d, moments where it \n before being \u201clegitimised and mainstreamed\u201d, that this happens no matter how much \u201cinstitutions fight against it\u201d. \u201cNothing is more unstable in music history than a period of stability,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe signal for new disruption\u2026 is usually that things are going smoothly\u201d. Whatever you make of his theories, you have to hope he\u2019s right.\nMy new year\u2019s resolution was to learn how to waste time, which has largely resulted in watching 20-year-old Jamie Oliver and Nigella repeats on the Food Network. This dirty habit got me thinking about the millennium-era hinterland between \n and \n: the sleek, aspirational aesthetic (Alessi gadgets, loft living, the \u201cJAZZ\u201d poster in Hugh Grant\u2019s living room in About a Boy, FCUK, CD towers, the new Beetle and the Audi TT, part-baked ciabatta rolls) and the drab music that went with it. \u201cA self-satisfied, low-stakes period,\u201d as \n.\nAs a 10-year-old at the arrival of the 2000s, I had no idea about a generation growing up after the post-Britpop comedown, nor how the New Labour government might play into any of this. I had never heard of Islington. But I saw this lifestyle and heard those responsible for its soundtrack \u2013 \n, Dido, Zero 7, Groove Armada, R\u00f6yksopp, hazy Balearic dance music \u2013 through British romcoms and The Naked Chef, and was captivated. (I still use the bank account that I opened because it came with a free Toploader album.)\nAs millennials grow up and claim more cultural space, plenty of music from this period has been critically rehabilitated: Destiny\u2019s Child as trailblazing R&B stars, Shakira as a master of \n; emo for its portrayal of masculine sensitivity, even \n. That hasn\u2019t come for this music \u2013 often acoustic, maudlin, faintly tinged with trip-hop \u2013 and I wonder if it ever will. This Friday, David Gray is reissuing White Ladder for its 20th anniversary (though really its 22nd, if you count its initial, unsuccessful release in 1998) and I can\u2019t imagine sympathetic reconsiderations are forthcoming. Singles Sail Away and Babylon still have a deep emotional tug, though the lovelorn Gray of the late 90s sounds almost wearier still for all the cultural baggage he\u2019s dragging alongside the heartache. I barely noticed as the middle of the album shrugged along.\nWhite Ladder may be more useful as a time capsule. As monolithic as these songs feel, it\u2019s striking how unseated Gray is in the lyrics: reaching for love as a stabilising force in a world he no longer understands, despite it arriving during a relative period of stability: White Ladder hit No 1 in the UK for the first time five weeks before 9/11. That desperation for intimacy in upsetting times has to be at least partially responsible for it becoming one of the longest-charting albums in UK history and our 28th best-selling album of all time. And its long-tail effect: Gray may no longer be the commercial giant he once was, but we haven\u2019t escaped his influence \u2013 just look at Lewis Capaldi, another balladeer buoying Britain through hard times.\nMeanwhile, lifestyle is no less of a stand-in for personality than it was becoming then. When I mentioned my interest in this period on Twitter, critic Simon Price alerted me to the existence of Jamie Oliver\u2019s 2000 compilation Cookin\u2019: Music to Cook To, and \n. As endearingly guileless as they are, you have to suspect that a guy who built an empire on liberal application of olive oil and fake geezer patois knew exactly what he was doing when he reminisced about the Manic Street Preachers\u2019 Motorcycle Emptiness \u2013 \n \u2013 being \u201cthe first song I played when I passed my driving test on my 100W Pioneer\u201d. Happy days.\nLaid up with flu a couple of weeks ago, I missed my chance to see Madonna at the Palladium. \n reminded me that I hadn\u2019t seen Madonna\u2019s 1991 tour film, Truth or Dare, which he called \u201cthe Olympic standard for pop-star portraiture\u201d, so I downed some more Sudafed and cued it up. What a riot it is. From a journalistic perspective, the complete access that director Alek Keshishian had to Madonna during her 1990 Blond Ambition tour seems like the stuff of fantasy today, when \n.\nKeshishian is right there as Toronto police order Madonna not to stimulate masturbating on stage \u2013 and when she does it, and they decide not to bother arresting her, she tell the press that they did anyway. We see her sticking her hand in her crush Antonio Banderas\u2019s face when it turns out he\u2019s married. She is a mercurial protector of her vulnerable dancers, catty and capricious and brilliant. But without detracting from how much I loved it, it also made me think about what counts as a revealing portrait of a female musician, especially after I read film-maker \n that defines many leading roles for women. \u201cThe more I acted the Strong Female Lead,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe more I became aware of the narrow specificity of the characters\u2019 strengths \u2013 physical prowess, linear ambition, focused rationality. Masculine modalities of power.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thrill to see a musician \u2013 especially a female one \u2013 live up to their outrageous reputation, though that shouldn\u2019t make smaller truths and vignettes on less outlandish behaviour feel any less significant in different kinds of stories. Although there were all sorts of topics I would have loved to see Swift get to in Miss Americana (topics \n), I felt like the film did a great job of showing exactly what the four walls of her existence look like; where the boundaries were and which of them she was willing to breach. Truth or dare needn\u2019t be mutually exclusive \u2013 as \n, a forthcoming tour mockumentary in which Sleater-Kinney\u2019s Carrie Brownstein attempts to make a movie about St Vincent, satirises brilliantly. \nIt may not have won any of the 23 Oscars, Baftas or Golden Globes that it was nominated for, but \n is still one of the finest movies of 2019. As ever with Scorsese\u2019s gangster pictures, he gets so much mileage out of the stupidity of violence. There\u2019s outright slapstick at one end, with black comedy somewhere towards the middle; down at the other end is the sad pointlessness of what these men are doing to each other. \u201cThey do something to me, I do something to them,\u201d Al Pacino\u2019s Jimmy Hoffa says at one point. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t know anything else, do you?\u201d On and on it goes, the retributive violence of these men, violence that is kept alive in the rickety cage of an honour code. The darkest running joke in Scorsese\u2019s movies is that all the shootings and beatings are meted out in the name of \u201crespect\u201d.\nWatching The Irishman and Goodfellas in close succession, it struck me that music is a key part of this world-building. So much Scorsese business goes on in bars and clubs, all the glad-handing and performative respect-showing, and this requires a certain soundtrack: crooning. This is music that smooths out rough edges, that is all about respect, to one\u2019s ears at least \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if these singers have been hired to keep the hoods calm. Their dreamy love songs signify classiness, and signifiers of classiness \u2013 suits, cars, jewellery, handshakes \u2013 are what make Scorsese\u2019s corrupted worlds go round, rather than the hard work of genuinely classy behaviour.\nHere and elsewhere, music is a neat way to conjure a period atmosphere, or make subtle jokes, like the use of Frosty the Snowman during Goodfellas\u2019 coked-out Christmas. But it\u2019s often deeper than that. Take the scene in Goodfellas where the \n for delivering messages from Henry\u2019s school to his parents, that let them know he was missing class (double meaning intended). It\u2019s soundtracked not by sinister orchestral brooding, but by the peppy 1950s pop song Hearts of Stone by the Charms \u2013 it\u2019s as if Henry is filling his own head with the jolly music, drowning out the wrongness of what his new employers are doing, and casting it merely as energetic alpha business. The audience, in turn, is seduced into thinking these guys are brashly cool. Scorsese uses music to blur our sense of morality, and gaslights us into thinking these people are maybe alright after all. Our own moral compass spins around hopelessly, while his quietly stays the course.\nBuzzFeed\u2019s resident celebrity academic re-examines a controversial period in Taylor Swift\u2019s history in light of her revelation, from \n, that she \n earlier in her career.\nIn \n, Billie Eilish attempted to make a clumsy distinction between \u201cwriting a story\u201d, as she says she does in her music, and \u201clying\u201d, pointing the finger at (nameless) contemporary rappers for \u201cposturing\u201d. Rap fans were quick to point out Eilish\u2019s musical and stylistic debt to hip-hop \u2013 not to mention her avowed admiration of rappers including the late XXXtentacion \u2013 and a backlash started to brew. Vulture\u2019s Craig Jenkins took a characteristically rational look at both sides of the debate.\nAs \n debuts her immaculate new single as a live Colors session, this piece from October 2019 on how the Berlin-based live performance channel became a major industry player is worth reading.\nWe\u2019d love to hear from you about the music you\u2019ve been loving over the last month or so, and any random musical thoughts you\u2019ve been having \u2013 please share them in the comments below and we\u2019ll include the most interesting in next month\u2019s column.\nWe liked this comment last month in response to Laura\u2019s ode to the iPod, \n: \u201cGood thing about the iPod classic is you can search for music under the blankets in the dark without looking with its 2 controls with no fear of waking your partner. It\u2019s a kind of braille that you learn - you know that Steve Winwood is near Steely Dan etc.\u201d\n: \u201cFor the most part, music consumption has improved massively over the last 8 years. There is simply no point trying to make out as if the ipod was in any way a superior device. It wasn\u2019t. It was clunky, had limited disk space and only the nano and shuffle versions offered any real portability. There is virtually nothing that makes owning music in any way a superior to current options like Spotify. You never owned your digital downloads either...its like everyone suddenly forgot what a massive legal headache this was.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/top-10-books-of-eco-fiction": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/top-10-books-of-eco-fiction", "title": "Top 10 books of eco-fiction | Michael Christie", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:54:14 GMT", "summary": "<p>As the climate crisis grows ever clearer, the best fiction can help realign our conception of nature<br></p><p>As our real-world ecosystem further devolves, we\u2019ll soon move into the pining-for-our-ex-phase of the relationship \u2013 watching the BBC\u2019s Planet Earth documentaries like old wedding videos after a nasty divorce.

But books can reconfigure our conception of nature for the better.\nMy new novel, \n, begins in 2038 on a remote island off the Pacific coast of British Columbia, where wealthy tourists flock from all corners of the dust-choked globe to visit the Greenwood Arboreal Cathedral\u00ad \u2013 one of the world\u2019s last remaining forests.

The dispossessed, hungry, and homeless migrate through baking dust in search of better lives, only to be turned back by callously protectionist locals. Sound familiar? It\u2019s also a heartbreaking testament to the fact that eco-fiction need not be speculative. And even the most hard-hearted readers will be softened by Steinbeck\u2019s eternally revolutionary idea: \u201cMaybe all men got one big soul ever\u2019body\u2019s a part of.\u201d\nA prescient novella about an interstellar logging colony, written by perhaps our greatest practitioner of \u201cliterary sci-fi\u201d. Published in 1972, Le Guin\u2019s book asserted that colonialism, extractivism, and environmental despoliation are endemic to humankind, and we surely haven\u2019t proved her wrong in the years since. Concerning her novella\u2019s similarities to the blockbuster film Avatar, which Le Guin described as \u201ca high-budget, highly successful film\u201d that \u201ccompletely reverses the book\u2019s moral premise, presenting the central and unsolved problem of the book, mass violence, as a solution\u201d, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019m glad I have nothing at all to do with it\u201d.\nIn her bold and strange novel, Watkins disassembles the mythology of the American west, paying particular attention to its brutal expansionism and unquestioned promise of personal reinvention. The story concerns a young couple trying to navigate post-apocalyptic California, where severe drought has baked the once fertile landscape into sandstorms and squalor. Peopled by wandering cults and water dowsers, Gold Fame Citrus shows us that perhaps the notions of \u201cShangri-La\u201d and \u201cMan-Made Hell on Earth\u201d are two sides of the same ideological coin.\nPublished in 1962, and only Ballard\u2019s second book, The Drowned World ought to be recognised as one of the pioneering works of climate fiction. By 2145, global warming has made slush of the ice caps (we \nthis would happen, Exxon!), the seas have risen, and tropical swamps and jungles now dominate most of the Earth\u2019s surface. A group of surveyors are sent from Greenland to soggy, flooded London to determine whether the southern world can someday be reclaimed. Writing during the era we believed most fervently that the world was ours to mould and shape, Ballard warned us that it wasn\u2019t.\nNot the apocalypse so much as the prequel to it. Armed with more tree-related research than you can stack in your woodshed, Powers decentralises humans from his story to great effect, demonstrating how wanton deforestation and the reckless disregard for the complexity of natural systems have landed us in the mess we\u2019re in. If you don\u2019t come away from this novel with a deeper appreciation for trees, then you\u2019re probably the CEO of a leading forestry company.\nThis brilliant National Book award-winning novel concerns the plight of Esch, a poor and pregnant 15-year-old, living with her family in Bois Sauvage, a mostly black Mississippi bayou town sitting smack dab in the path of hurricane Katrina. Set during the 12-day lead-up to landfall (plus a few days of aftermath), this mythic tragedy demonstrates what it means when the most vulnerable (and immobile) of us are struck by disaster. No novel draws a better link between personal traumas and climate traumas. In the storm\u2019s wake, Esch muses: \u201cSuddenly there is a great split between now and then, and I wonder where the world where that day happened has gone, because we are not in it.\u201d\nThough the exact cause of the calamity that necessitates all kinds of scrabbling barbarism remains unclear, its human ramifications are described with ruthless specificity. In an interview, McCarthy later claimed that he imagined the disaster as the aftermath of a comet strike, but I don\u2019t buy it. This is eco-fiction through and through. And now that I\u2019m a father, I can\u2019t help but read The Road as an ode to parenting in a fallen world; to sighting the disaster that you hope your children won\u2019t have to face, but know deep-down they will and must. Regularly I have my own Road-type conversations with my sons: \u201cWhy do we buy gas if it\u2019s destroying our planet, Dad?\u201d \u201cBecause I need to get to work.\u201d \u201cThen why don\u2019t you work somewhere closer to our house?\u201d and on it goes. I mean really, what\u2019s the best way to tell a child that this wondrous world they\u2019ve just come to know is hurtling towards ruin?\nOmar El Akkad tapped into his experience as a journalist in Afghanistan and the Middle East to prophesy a whole new history for the US, including the second civil war of 2074, which was just as barbaric as the first. The conflict was kicked off when the northern states outlawed fossil fuels after Florida was flooded with seawater, and, naturally, the southerners revolted, and the country again tore in half. A harrowing reminder that our old wounds can flare up in times of greatest turmoil.\nThe best eco-fiction doesn\u2019t present our reckless alteration of the natural ecological order as a single apocalyptic event, with us playing the resident despoilers and the Earth our helpless victim. Instead it reminds us of our profound and inescapable interconnection with the natural world. Clade, Australian novelist James Bradley\u2019s ingenious novel, tells the story of many generations of one family, all played out on a stage that is being incrementally destroyed by climate change, though few of the characters notice. Clade reminds us that world indeed won\u2019t end with a bang, but with a long series of breakdowns, extinctions, die-offs, fires, floods, droughts, blights, and dust storms, during which our human lives will carry on just as messily as ever. And perhaps our greatest sin of all will be our failure to notice.\nIn rural Tennessee during an unrelenting period of unseasonable rain, a young woman named Dellarobia happens upon the uncanny spectacle of millions of monarch butterflies congregating in a field near her house. As competing interests fight to worship, capitalise upon, or preserve this unique phenomenon, the ensuing \u201cBattle of the Butterflies\u201d is a lesson in our frustratingly human tendency to focus on symptoms instead of root causes. As she watches the frenzied media coverage on her television, Dellarobia observes: \u201cNobody was asking why the butterflies were here; the big news was just that they \n.\u2019\u201d\n \n is published by Scribe.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/12/blood-wedding-review-salisbury-playhouse": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/12/blood-wedding-review-salisbury-playhouse", "title": "Blood Wedding review \u2013 Barney Norris takes Lorca's tragedy to Wiltshire", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 14:44:32 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Salisbury Playhouse</strong><br>Emmet Byrne is superb in this relocated update of the Spanish classic but it lacks the fire of the original</p><p>Barney Norris tames Lorca\u2019s Spanish tragedy in this gentle adaptation set in modern-day Wiltshire.

The Dutch architect was there to meet Lance Gilman, the cowboy hat-wearing proprietor of the Mustang Ranch bordello who is the unlikely visionary behind some of the planet\u2019s largest yet least known buildings. What Koolhaas saw that day would radically alter his thinking on the future of architecture.\nA short drive from the heart-shaped swimming pools and red faux crocodile-skin furniture of Gilman\u2019s office in the adult resort, a strange apparition of enormous white rectangles appeared in the desert. \u201cIt is a fantastically beautiful landscape,\u201d says Koolhaas, \u201cwith rolling hills and wild horses. And in the middle of it all were these colossal structures, placed in a way that didn\u2019t seem to suggest any coherence or sign of human inhabitation.\u201d\nIf you \n, these blocks appear like large chalky fields, or the salt evaporation pools of a lithium mine. But they are mines of a different kind: vast industrial sheds housing the technology behind the blockchain, the cloud, and the future of electric vehicles.\nThis is the \n (TRIC), the largest industrial park in the world, a 107,000-acre swath of the Nevada desert that has become the backroom for Silicon Valley\u2019s big tech companies, lured here by the favourable tax regime and instant building permits. Gilman bought the land for $20m in 1998 from Gulf Oil, which had planned to fill it with big game and turn it into a luxury hunting reserve. Gilman quickly had it zoned for industrial use, and the big boxes have sprung up like rectangular fungi after rain. It is now home to gargantuan hangars for Google and Apple, along with distribution warehouses for businesses such as Walmart and Amazon, and \n \u2013 set to be, at 1m sq metres, the world\u2019s biggest building when finally complete.\nIt might be fitting that a brothel baron now presides over a landscape of \u201cfulfilment centres\u201d of another kind, but what interested Koolhaas wasn\u2019t the developer, nor the chance of another commission. It was that the buildings were thrillingly different from anything he had encountered before.\n\u201cThere has been no architecture of a similar vigour in the last 100 years,\u201d he writes in an ode to the sheds. \u201cIt is based strictly on codes, algorithms, technologies, engineering and performance, not intention. Its boredom is hypnotic, its banality breathtaking.\u201d For Koolhaas, these buildings embody a new kind of sublime.\nA pair of 12ft-high photographs of the data centres now hang on the top floor of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, occupying the final level of a sprawling exhibition, momentously titled \n, set to open next week. Five years in the making, and drawing on a decade of research undertaken by his team at AMO (the \u201cthinktank\u201d of \n and armies of volunteer students, the scope of the show is nothing if not ambitious.\n\u201cWe decided to focus on the 98% of the Earth\u2019s surface that is not occupied by cities,\u201d says Koolhaas, casually, as if the prospect were like any other design brief. \u201cAt a certain point, the UN declared that half of mankind is now living in cities, since when there has been an avalanche of books and biennales talking only about cities. As a result, there is an enormous deficit in understanding what is happening in the countryside, which is where the truly radical changes are taking place.\u201d\nAt the age of 75, Koolhaas is turning his back on the very thing that made his career. For the last 40 years he has been the seer of cities, provocative poet of the urban condition, producing polemical texts on the unintended consequences of modernity. He made his name with the sizzling \u201cretroactive manifesto\u201d for Manhattan, \n, in 1978. Since then he has theorised on everything from the \n to the \n, and the \n in airports and business parks. \nHis tone is at once celebratory and contemptuous, as if simultaneously intoxicated and repelled by the phenomena he describes. The buildings produced by OMA have occupied a similar realm, treading a fine line between the bold and banal. They often reflect the unvarnished, brute reality of the city and, more recently in the case of his blocky, mixed-use building the \n, the naked financial interests that shaped them.\nBut now the rest of the world has caught up and the urban obsession has taken over, the self-styled contrarian has had to move on. \u201cI am interested in the countryside now for the same reason that I was paying attention to \n in the 70s,\u201d Koolhaas says. \u201cBecause no one else was looking.\u201d\nHis interest in rural transformation was first piqued by changes that he noticed in a \n, where he had holidayed for years. The area\u2019s population was decreasing, yet the village was expanding, with an ever-increasing number of holiday homes and a new demographic: urbanites seeking wellness, accompanied by a transitory community of south Asian housemaids. These discoveries prompted Koolhaas to survey a chunk of the Dutch countryside, where he found farmers diversifying alongside an influx of wealthy city-dwellers wanting to sample life in the country, \u201cattracted by the aura of authenticity\u201d.\n\u201cWe started to find deeply absurd conditions,\u201d he says. The more he looked, the more he started to see the global countryside as an enormous canvas on which anything too large, complex or unsafe to blend with urban life takes place. \u201cA world formerly dictated by the seasons and the organisation of agriculture,\u201d he writes, \u201cis now a toxic mix of genetic experiment, science, industrial nostalgia, seasonal immigration, territorial buying sprees, massive subsidies, incidental inhabitation, tax incentives, investment, political turmoil \u2013 in other words more volatile than the most accelerated city.\u201d While we were all concentrating on cities, he argues, the next revolution was forging ahead in the hinterland, undisturbed.\nThere is a naivety to how Koolhaas recounts some of these revelations, which suggests a sheltered urbanite whose musings on rural life are as ill-fitting as muddy wellies in his Prada wardrobe. Yet much of the strength of his work has come from approaching topics as an innocent outsider. One mentor from his early life as a journalist, before he moved into architecture, told him to treat every situation as if he was a Martian new to Earth. It can be a compelling style of writing, but will this detached observer\u2019s deadpan study of disparate rural phenomena translate into a meaningful exhibition?\nThe sense that this is no ordinary Guggenheim show will begin before you enter the building. Visitors will be greeted by a gigantic hi-tech tractor, capable of being controlled from an iPad, parked on the pavement next to a large module growing tomatoes under pink light: objects from the digitised frontline of agriculture brought back to the city.\nIn a manner reminiscent of the architect Philip Johnson\u2019s seminal \n show in 1934 at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (which placed utilitarian, industrially manufactured objects in a museum setting for the first time) visitors will encounter a satellite dangling in the atrium, along with a big bale of hay and an underwater drone designed to patrol coral reefs. From here, the rotunda spiral will extend upwards in a continuous stream of consciousness, with sections on leisure, politics, preservation, agricultural automation and numerous other facets of rural existence that have preoccupied the busy Dutchman and his extensive cast of collaborators.\n\u201cIt is a total panoply of voices and themes, cutting across space and time in a really unconventional way,\u201d says Guggenheim curator Troy Conrad Therrien. \u201cIt abandons the usual museological preciousness of classification and creates juxtapositions intended to make people think.\u201d\nThe list of themes reads like the contents page of National Geographic crossed with Wired. It includes the countryside as a cradle of culture in ancient China and Rome; how dictators from Stalin to Mao have left their mark on the land; the ways that \n; how \n; how \n; the impact of thawing permafrost in Siberia; technological change in American midwest farms. The list goes on. They sound like fascinating, urgent stories, but it is hard to see how they might form a coherent narrative. And what has it all got to do with architecture?\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with architecture,\u201d Koolhaas admits. \u201cIt is more anthropological and sociological. I find it exciting that an art institution would dedicate so much space to something that is not art or architecture.\u201d Therrien describes it as a \u201cpointillist portrait of a mutating territory\u201d, a show about curiosity and questioning rather than providing answers. \u201cWill it feel overwhelming to the visitor? Yes.\u201d Might it feel colonialist and out of touch? Maybe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to put a wokeness veneer over the show,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the age of outrage, there are some things that people might take out of context and create a hurricane around, but they are what they are.\u201d\nThere is a tendency for \u201cresearch-led\u201d architectural exhibitions to end up feeling like a book stuck to the wall, and there is a danger the Guggenheim exhibition could fall into that trap. Therrien says that text will be a big part of the show, along with huge printed curtains and long ribbons of wallpaper that will wrap around many of the walls, with video screens showing documentary footage. There will also be a handful of roving robots, of the kind used in \n, adorned with styrofoam cutouts intended to \u201cconstantly throw the curatorial ball up in the air\u201d.\nSome who were involved in the project fear Koolhaas might have finally bitten off more than he can chew. \u201cIt\u2019s problematic to call it \u2018research\u2019,\u201d says Charlotte Leib, a doctoral student at Yale, who was part of the exhibition\u2019s team when she was studying at Harvard. \u201cThere are thousands of experts in these fields, and some of them were contacted, but it was a process of sculpting their findings towards the worldview of Rem.\u201d Another research assistant is frank: \u201cIt\u2019s symptomatic of architectural hubris that they take snapshots of a topic like this and present it to the world as \u2018new\u2019.\u201d\nSo what does Koolhaas want visitors to take away from his grand rural ramble? \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to put relevant issues on the architecture agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not thinking there should be more planning of the countryside, or that it is the next big place for architects to intervene.\u201d His attraction to the megastructures of the industrialised hinterland is precisely because they have nothing to do with architects. They are ultra-utilitarian sheds, divorced from architectural ambition.\n\u201cThere is a danger of Midas in reverse, in terms of the consequences of architectural attention suddenly shifting to phenomena that were being developed innocently on their own,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s more likely that architecture will change as a result of what\u2019s happening outside cities, rather than architects spoiling this new field.\u201d\nKoolhaas says his own practice has already been influenced by what he calls the \u201cpost-human\u201d architecture of the colossal sheds at TRIC and elsewhere, which he sees as embodying a kind of unparalleled purity. \u201cWe are programmed to think that any \u2018next\u2019 architecture can only be the outcome of a struggle,\u201d he writes, in an exhibition catalogue essay. \u201cModernism was born in a relentless campaign of stripping: of ornament, bourgeois values, frivolity. Because it takes place in the countryside, this is a stealth revolution \u2026 The buildings here are not for humans but for things and machines. Thousands of years of architectural and cultural history are ditched.\u201d\nHe describes OMA\u2019s \n, still under construction, as a result of this logic \u2013 \u201chalfway between a building for humans and machinery\u201d. It incorporates a huge amount of back-of-house space for scenery and mechanisms to transform the auditoria in multiple configurations. \n, a new \u00a3130m venue being designed for Manchester, looks distinctly shed-like, and one wonders if OMA might be taking the \u201cpost-human\u201d idea a bit too literally, judging by the blank street frontage of its \n.\nKoolhaas\u2019s exit from the city comes at a time when he seems increasingly detached from the built output of his practice. He keeps his own separate office in Amsterdam, away from the 300-strong team in Rotterdam, where he can concentrate away from the hubbub. There has been a restructuring of the partnership, so he is no longer the dominant overseeing principal, and OMA\u2019s buildings are now credited to the individual partners. He rarely attends the openings. Is this epic exhibition his swan song before quitting architecture?\n\u201cAm I going to retire?\u201d he barks, incredulously, before changing the subject to a new kind of tractor.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/wes-andersons-the-french-dispatch-first-trailer-launched-online": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/wes-andersons-the-french-dispatch-first-trailer-launched-online", "title": "Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch: first trailer launched online", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:18:42 GMT", "summary": "<p>First footage of Anderson\u2019s \u2018love letter to journalists\u2019 starring Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton released</p><p>The first trailer for Wes Anderson\u2019s new film, The French Dispatch, has been released online.</p><p>Set in France, the film is a \u201clove letter to journalists\u201d that revolves around a New Yorker-style periodical edited by one Arthur Howitzer Jr (played by Bill Murray) and boasts Anderson\u2019s usual gallery of big name cameos, including Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Benicio del Toro, Saoirse Ronan and Elisabeth Moss. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/wes-andersons-the-french-dispatch-first-trailer-launched-online\">Continue reading...</a>", "story": "The first trailer for Wes Anderson\u2019s new film, The French Dispatch, has been released online.\nSet in France, the film is a \u201clove letter to journalists\u201d that revolves around a New Yorker-style periodical edited by one Arthur Howitzer Jr (played by Bill Murray) and boasts Anderson\u2019s usual gallery of big name cameos, including Tilda Swinton, \n, Benicio del Toro, Saoirse Ronan and Elisabeth Moss.\nThe French Dispatch is due for release on 24 July in the US and 28 August in the UK.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/12/sonia-boyce-first-black-woman-artist-represent-great-britain-venice-biennale": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/12/sonia-boyce-first-black-woman-artist-represent-great-britain-venice-biennale", "title": "Sonia Boyce first black woman to represent Britain at Venice Biennale", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 10:36:18 GMT", "summary": "<p>Artist caused storm in 2018 when she removed painting of nymphs from Manchester Art Gallery</p><p>The artist Sonia Boyce has been chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale \u2013 the first black woman to do so.

I don\u2019t know if it is anachronistic but I still think it is important in the time we are in to think about what nation means,\u201d she said.\nBoyce also hinted that her work at the Venice Biennale could involve collaboration.

In 1987, she became the first black woman to enter the Tate\u2019s collection when it bought her drawing \n; 29 years later, she became the first black woman to be elected a Royal Academician. She was awarded an OBE this year.\nBoyce\u2019s work combines media photography, drawing, performance and film, drawing on a range of collaborators in order to explore her experience as a black woman in a tradition that has excluded people like her.\n: \u201cIt was very clear when I was at art college that I was somehow out of place; the system hadn\u2019t anticipated me, or anyone like me. Even though there were a lot of female students, they were thought about as though they were being trained to become the wives of artists, not artists themselves. As a black person, there wasn\u2019t a narrative at all. Maybe to be a model.\u201d\nEmma Dexter, the chair of the British pavilion selection committee, said: \u201cBoyce\u2019s work raises important questions about the nature of creativity, questioning who makes art, how ideas are formed, and the nature of authorship. At such a pivotal moment in the UK\u2019s history, the committee has chosen an artist whose work embodies inclusiveness, generosity, experimentation and the importance of working together.\u201d\nBoyce said: \u201cYou could have knocked me down with a feather when I got the call to tell me I had been chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale 2021 \u2013 it was like a bolt out of the blue. Obviously, I\u2019m extremely honoured, excited \u2013 and nervous. I\u2019m eager to start this creative journey, exploring the experience with others who agree to work with me along the way.\u201d\nIn France, the selection of the first artist of Algerian descent to represent the country at the biennale has caused controversy. \n has faced calls to step down after accusations that she supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls on the Israeli government to grant equality to Palestinian citizens by imposing a cultural boycott.\nThe French writer and philosopher \n was one of the figures calling for the French government to give the honour to another artist, while Sedira denies the link to BDS, calling the accusations \u201cunfounded and slanderous\u201d. \n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/damien-hirst-medicine-cabinet-auction": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/damien-hirst-medicine-cabinet-auction", "title": "Early Damien Hirst artwork bought for \u00a3600 could fetch \u00a31.8m", "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:14:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>Artist pays tribute to collector Robert Tibbles, who was his first customer in 1989</p><p>In 1989, 28-year-old Robert Tibbles bought a medicine cabinet artwork full of bottles of pills for \u00a3600.

Criticising the lineup, Snapes had argued that bands need to \u201cuse their leverage to demand equality on the bill\u201d.\nHealy told the Guardian that the issue of inclusivity and representation at music festivals was important, \u201cbecause the people that go to them feel more included and more represented. It\u2019s as simple as that. All the best art for me made me feel personally addressed.\u201d\nHe praised Reading and Leeds promoter Melvin Benn for helping the band carry out environmental initiatives around their 2019 headline sets at the festival, and at their one-day festival in London\u2019s Finsbury Park this summer. Healy said that if it was possible to make environmental change on this scale \u2013 \u201cthey have the will to do it that goes outside of personal gain\u201d \u2013 the issue of gender inequality at festivals could also be tackled.\nHealy said he wanted to see other male musicians taking similar steps to ensure the equal representation of women, non-binary and transgender musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s all about action,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to big sociopolitical issues and governments are involved, sometimes action or protest can just be ignored. But when it comes to the music industry, we can change that. It\u2019s not a geopolitical nightmare: it\u2019s the music industry, and it\u2019s something that if everyone gets on board, we can fix.\u201d\nWhen asked how he thought how booking agents would respond to his decision, he said he was \u201cvery sceptical of the idea of people\u2019s short-term or long-term personal profit not always being paramount\u201d, but that he hoped an influx of younger people in decision-making roles would affect change. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the people in those roles now are blindly ignorant, but people need a kick up the arse. And we should accept that some people are willing to learn.\u201d\nThe 1975\u2019s Finsbury Park show features seven support acts, six of which feature exclusively female performers. Healy said the billing wasn\u2019t intended as any kind of statement, but as a representation of what he and fans of the 1975 listen to. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t make sense that there\u2019s such a lack of representation [in festival lineups].\u201d\nThe 1975, who won two Brits awards in 2019 and whose three albums have all topped the UK charts, headlined the \n in 2019, where five of the 25 main-stage acts featured women. In another tweet, Healy said: \u201cPoint is that Reading and Leeds with more women would be honestly the best festival in the world.\u201d\nCritics of Reading and Leeds festival have re-edited the poster to remove all of the male artists to highlight the disparity, a tradition that took off \n, when the lineup announcement only featured nine female acts. Other major 2020 festivals have a similarly stark gender split, including Wireless, which features only six female artists across the 43 acts announced so far.\nCampaigning against gender inequality in music festivals has been growing in recent years, with festivals including the BBC Proms, Bluedot and Liverpool Sound City signing up to the \n, pledging to have at least 50% female artists on their lineups by 2022.

Portman\u2019s A Tale of Love and Darkness is the only female-directed film on its list, while Lynne Ramsay left Jane Got a Gun and was replaced by Gavin O\u2019Connor.\nMcGowan, \n, about her alleged experience with Harvey Weinstein in 2018, wrote about Portman: \u201cYou are the problem. Lip service is the problem \u2026 I am singling you out because you are the latest in a long line of actresses who are acting the part of a woman who cares about other women.

He is not guilty and he is not going to be testifying.\u201d\nJudge James Burke asked Weinstein directly whether he agreed with that, and Weinstein said he did.\nWeinstein\u2019s decision to remain aloof from the proceedings in effect brought to an end the defense phase of the trial, and with it the evidence that will be presented to the jury of seven men and five women.\nLater this week, defense lawyers followed by prosecutors will present closing arguments, leaving the jury to deliberate on its verdict early next week.\nDespite his silence, Weinstein, 67, has been a dominant presence throughout the five weeks of the trial so far. He has been in court every day, usually shuffling in on his now trademark walking frame with yellow tennis balls at its feet. The defendant has maintained a largely impassive stance at the defense table. At points in his accusers\u2019 testimony, however, he has permitted himself a brief laugh or shrug of his head.\nOnly occasionally has he been heard speaking, responding to reporters\u2019 questions outside the courtroom. At the start of the trial, he said he was feeling \u201cvery confident\u201d about its outcome because \u201cI got great lawyers\u201d. Another time he was asked whether one of the witness\u2019s descriptions of his deformed body and genitals was accurate, and he sarcastically replied: \u201cPerfect.\u201d\nOver the past few days, during the defense stage of proceedings, Weinstein\u2019s legal team has sought to discredit and undermine the accounts given to the jury by the six women who have testified. In particular, Rotunno and her colleagues have homed in on one of the two central accusers in the case, a 34-year-old woman whom the Guardian is not naming because it is unclear whether she approves being identified.\nEarlier this month the woman testified that she was raped by the defendant in March 2013 in a hotel room at the Doubletree hotel in midtown Manhattan. After the alleged rape, the accuser said, she found a syringe in a trash can that she later found out was medicine for erectile dysfunction that Weinstein must have injected himself with.\nThe woman\u2019s allegations are key to the prosecution case against Weinstein, who faces two counts of rape flowing from her account. He also faces one count that he forced oral sex in 2006 on a then Project Runway production assistant, Miriam Haley, and two counts of predatory sexual assault that require sex crimes to be proved against multiple women and carry a top sentence of life in prison.\nWeinstein has pleaded not guilty and has insisted that all sexual encounters were consensual. He has now been accused of a range of sexual misconduct, from harassment to rape, by 105 women.\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers appear to have calculated that the rape accuser is the weak link in the prosecution strategy. In a \n, the New York district attorney\u2019s office decided to make a central pillar of the case a witness who has admitted to maintaining consensual sexual relations both before and long after the alleged attack happened.\nIn 2017, four years after she said she was raped at the Doubletree, the accuser sent an email to Weinstein saying: \u201cI love you, I always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call. ;)\u201d.\nSexual crimes experts emphasize that rape is often committed by men who know their victims, and that intimate relations \u2013 including sexual ones \u2013 can follow violent acts. Yet Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have made maximum use of emails between the former producer and the woman to suggest that she was either lying or had unreliable memories.\nOn Tuesday, the defense called under subpoena a friend of the accuser in an attempt to undermine her account further. Thomas Richards, an entertainment agent, had been with the accuser in the Doubletree hotel at the time of the alleged assault and had attended a breakfast with her and Weinstein in the lobby cafe shortly after she said the rape had occurred.\nUnder questioning by a defense lawyer, Richards said she had looked \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cher everyday self\u201d at the table. He recalled nothing unusual about the way his friend appeared or behaved in front of Weinstein, and said nothing stood out about her dress, complexion or hair, or eyes.\n\u201cWas there any indication to you whatsoever that she was in any sort of distress?\u201d Cheronis asked. The witness said there was not.\nThe defense is now focusing on the rape accuser, seeking to puncture a hole in the case against the defendant. On Monday, Talita Maia, a Brazilian model, was also \n to give evidence.\nShe too said that the woman had seemed \u201clike herself\u201d at the Doubletree breakfast that she also attended soon after the alleged rape. She told the jury that her then friend had once called Weinstein her \u201cspiritual soul mate\u201d.\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar", "title": "Parasite makes Oscars history as first foreign language winner of best picture", "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 10:41:43 GMT", "summary": "<p>Bong Joon-ho\u2019s South Korean satire wins top prize after taking best director, international film and original screenplay</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/like-halle-berry-versus-gum-disease-things-we-learned-at-the-2020-oscars\">Nine things we learned at the Oscars</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasites-brilliant-win-is-a-portent-of-change-in-the-conceited-hollywood-club\">Peter Bradshaw: Parasite\u2019s brilliant win is a portent of change</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-best-picture-new-era-for-oscars\">Phil Hoad: 2020 Oscars could kickstart era of internationalism</a><br></li></ul><p>After an awards season marked by its predictability, the Oscars delivered a spectacular final-reel twist on Sunday evening, naming capitalist satire Parasite best picture.</p><p>Bong Joon-ho\u2019s comedy-drama about an impoverished family who infiltrate the household of a wealthier one is the first film not in the English language to take the top prize.

It also took best \n, \n and \n.\n had been tipped to rule triumphant at this year\u2019s Academy Awards, following its key victories at the Baftas, Golden Globes and crucial bellwethers such as the Producers Guild Awards. In the event, the harrowing first world war drama took three awards: for Roger Deakins\u2019 cinematography and for its visual effects and sound mixing.\nBong\u2019s film also defeated Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Jojo Rabbit and The Irishman to best picture. It marks the first time in 65 years \u2013 since Marty in 1955 \u2013 that the winner of the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes has progressed to a best picture Oscar. \nBong paid tribute to Scorsese in his best director speech, saying that, when he was young, he \u201ccarved deep into my heart\u201d a quote by Scorsese: \u201cThe most personal is the most creative.\u201d\nHe also thanked Tarantino for championing his work: \u201cQuentin, I love you.\u201d\nWhen the film won best picture, Bong gave the microphone to the film\u2019s producers Kwak Sin-ae and\nMiky Lee. Kwak said she felt \u201ca very opportune moment in history is happening right now\u201d, and Lee paid tribute to Bong, praising his \u201ccrazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks \u2026 and especially the way he directs\u201d.\nShe then thanked the Korean cinemagoing public for \u201cnever hesitating to give us straightforward opinions that made us never about to be complacent, and to keep pushing the envelope.\u201d\nOnly 10 foreign-language films have previously been nominated for best picture \u2013 including Amour and Life Is Beautiful \u2013 but none of them won. Last year, many thought Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s autobiographical drama Roma might take best picture as well as director, but it was pipped to the post by Green Book. That result was not well received, with many people feeling the Academy\u2019s strenuous attempts to diversify were undermined by the celebration of a film whose approach \n seems more suited to its 60s setting than to 2019.\nSuch fallout \u2013 coupled with the backlash to the fact only one person of colour (Harriet\u2019s Cynthia Erivo) was nominated for an acting award \u2013 could help explain Parasite\u2019s unprecedented win. Voters are eager to prove their inclusivity, and that they don\u2019t fear what Bong called at the Golden Globes \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles\u201d.\nAlmost every person who took to the stage during the ceremony alluded to this year\u2019s dominant controversy, with Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s opening musical medley seeking to highlight ethnically diverse films, and rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar giving an earnest midway recap of the evening\u2019s inclusivity credentials. Opening presenter Chris Rock made blunt reference to what was missing from this year\u2019s director nominees: \u201cvaginas\u201d.\nLead actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a string of politically charged acceptance speeches \u2013 including his attack on the \n of the film industry at last Sunday\u2019s Baftas \u2013 with \n, imploring people to stop fighting and to stop exploiting one another, the planet and the other species living on it.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve become very disconnected from the natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of us are guilty of an egocentric worldview, and we believe that we\u2019re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that\u2019s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.\u201d\nHe closed his emotional address by quoting a lyric written aged 17 by his late brother, River: \u201cRun to the rescue with love and peace will follow.\u201d\nPhoenix was a much-anticipated victor in the best actor category, for his role as a mentally ill aspirant comedian in Joker; likewise Ren\u00e9e Zellweger being named best actress for her performance in the Judy Garland biopic raised few eyebrows.\nThe supporting actor races also unfolded as expected, with \nand \nwinning for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story, respectively. Both thanked their parents and their children, with Pitt straying into politics to mention that his 45-second speech was 45 seconds more than the time afforded to \n by the senate in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial.\nElsewhere, Taika Waititi proved a popular presence both on stage \u2013 where he dedicated his trophy for best adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit to \u201call the Indigenous kids all over the world\u201d \u2013 and backstage.\nIt was there he offered a commentary on contemporary far-right extremism, saying that, at the end of the second world war: \u201cif you were at Nazi, you would go to jail.

It\u2019s become a truism that western societies have difficulties accepting death, but Clarke, whose daily work is to ease the suffering of the dying, has a different view. She sees sense in avoiding the contemplation of death, and often applauds her patients for it \u2013 right up until they no longer have any choice.</p><p>It\u2019s a kindness to see death as belonging on the same list as brown envelopes from the government: \u201cMaybe, more prosaically, dying is on a par with tax returns and pensions.

We will not comprehend our direction of travel until much later.\nJohn is a programmer for a large technology company, working on the development of new applications. His wife, Shel, is a primatologist, about to embark on a field mission to Westenra Park, a conservation reserve for the last surviving troop of bonobos (the country is not specified). Two of the animals have recently died in unexplained circumstances, and a team of experts have been called in to investigate. Westenra Park itself is underwritten by a mining corporation specialising in the production and transport of breeze-block infrastructure. The company\u2019s main export is airport hubs, which are now considered to be prestige destinations in themselves. Tourism to Westenra Park has been suspended, supposedly to protect the integrity of the chimpanzees\u2019 environment, though visitors continue to flock to the \u201cnearby\u201d lake resorts hundreds of miles away:\nShel runs into problems from the start. The team\u2019s doctor is prevented from crossing the border and his place is taken by a young mycologist, Jane, who has no specialist knowledge of primates and little field experience. As they progress deeper into the park, Shel cannot help noticing how the bonobos\u2019 life cycle and bonding rhythms have become compromised by the erosion of their natural habitat. The forest ecosystem seems to be changing, and when contact with their support base is suddenly lost, the women find themselves caught between the desire to complete their investigation and the need to extricate themselves from a dangerous situation. When tragedy strikes, Shel blames herself, though she suspects there are other, more sinister forces at work \u2013 that the company has deemed them ultimately disposable.\nMeanwhile, back (presumably) in the UK, John\u2019s increasing anxiety about Shel\u2019s safety is further heightened by the fog that has engulfed their cottage and refuses to lift. Seeking distraction, he drives out to check on the semi-completed house they are supposed to be buying, only to be beaten unconscious by an unknown assailant. He wakes up back at the cottage, where he begins to receive daily visits from a mysterious doctor. As with his wife, his contact with the outside world has effectively been severed. As John\u2019s memories gradually return he starts to sense that he and Shel are experiencing variations of the same trauma, a loss of identity that feels personally directed but may simply be symptomatic of the way the world at large is beginning to slide.\nMacInnes\u2019s first novel, \n, came clothed in the durable outer garments of a detective thriller; \nemploys the same tactics, a narrative subversion signalled in advance by the novel\u2019s title.John and Shel pursue their own separate investigations, but as the gathering of evidence progresses we intuit a proliferation of parallels between their situations: the sensation of being under surveillance by malign authorities, the unexplained presence or absence of a nameless doctor, the unstoppable growth of fungus in a once-familiar environment.\nFor the women in Westenra Park, there is an increasing atmosphere of unspecific tension, compounded by the sense of being kept in ignorance of their true purpose. John, isolated in the cottage, teeters on the edge of breakdown, his obsessive-compulsive tendencies unbearably heightened by the drugs administered to him daily by the secretive medic. In \n, MacInnes\u2019s discredited cop follows his quarry into a primeval landscape that is portrayed as the ultimate escape, a rejection of the over-regulated world that threatens to throw us all under suspicion. In \n, the forests themselves are being pushed to the brink. On a planet consumed by vested interests, there is nowhere left to run to but inner space, the sterilised virtual realities created by the very conglomerates that are destroying the trees. MacInnes is showing us breakdown as M\u00f6bius strip, a catastrophe fuelled by the data harvested from the data we ourselves provide.\nIn his two novels, MacInnes has created claustrophobic, frightening, increasingly circumscribed worlds. We turn the final page of \n in little doubt as to who created Nest, or of where John\u2019s obsessive experimentation will eventually lead him. Nest is technology as fungal infection: \n.\nIn her 2015 book \n, Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing examines how the matsutake fungus \u2013 an expensive delicacy in Japan, freely occurring in forests of the northern hemisphere \u2013 lives in symbiosis with the trees that sustain it, encouraging new forest growth in seemingly untenable locations. The essential alienness of fungi \u2013 neither truly plant nor animal \u2013 has provided a wealth of recent inspiration for writers, especially in works of speculative fiction, as an expression of increasing disquiet in regard to the capitalist excesses of the Anthropocene. Readers familiar with Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s work will be aware of his fascination with fungi even before he ventured into Area X in the \n. MacInnes\u2019s detective in \n comes to believe his behaviour is being influenced by mind-altering spores, while MR Carey makes still more terrifying use of the \nfungus in his 2014 bestselling post-apocalypse novel \n. The idea of fungi as effecting an undermining of integrity that may not become apparent until the situation is irreversible appears to be the ultimate speculative metaphor for our unsettled times.\nMacInnes\u2019s writing is rigorous in its abstraction, almost stern in the complexity of its expression, yet there is a beauty to it, a quiet compassion that gets under the skin, rendering his traumatised characters not just familiar but sympathetic. For all his gathering of evidence, he offers scant conclusions and in this he is like every one of us, sharing our fear for the future even as he charts its progress in meticulous detail. This novel confirms MacInnes as a writer of serious ambition and an uncanny degree of talent.\n (\u00a312.99).\n"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email", "title": "Sign up to the Art Weekly email", "published": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 15:41:12 GMT", "summary": "<p>Get your weekly art world low-down every Friday, sketching out all the latest news, scandals and unmissable shows </p><p>Delivered right to your inbox every Friday afternoon, Art Weekly is your one-stop shop for all your arty needs ...
